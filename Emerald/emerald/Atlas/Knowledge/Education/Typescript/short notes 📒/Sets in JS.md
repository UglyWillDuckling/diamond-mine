[[Set]]

Sets are mathematical objects studied in set theory, the modern form of which dates to the 1870s. Most programming languages, including `JavaScript`, provide a set type with operations that would've been familiar to the set theorist **[Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor)** (1845 - 1918).
