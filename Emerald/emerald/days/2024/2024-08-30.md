	- went through the details of php formatting solution
		- PHPCS fixer and [[ecs]]
- **didn't** actually read any of [[Object Design Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations]] book as I was busy with work and calls

## today ðŸ—“
> first, free prose

Today is [[Antonio]]'s last day at work. We will have the [[e-coffe call]]  with him today at 11:00

At the moment I am still doing the [[switch over to Firefox]], only a few more things are needed to wrap up the change. The performance is still not great, nevertheless it's way better than it was before.

I would still like to continue reading [[Object Design Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations]] and also go back to [[Typesript Education]] - [[execute program courses ðŸŽ“]].

Along with all this, I do need to work on actual tickets. 
I have received a new assignment that has the purpose of swithing from [[estima]]'s to [[lead]]'s during a new [[project]]'s creation process. This ticket is regarded as an [[Epic]] and is expected to last for some time. The [[Lead Fix call]] I had with [[Paulo]] [[2024-08-29]] was about this, specifically it was the handover call from him to me.
The new ticket will be [[Use lead for project creation]]
