## goals
- migrate to using the `lead` as the source of data for [[Real Estate Project]]
	- compare the transactions made from estima's and lead's
	- ensure they are **compatible**

## what needs to be done
> subs and similiar
- see what to do about the `address_id`
- [[check that lead id is ahead of estima id]]

## todo ✔
- [x] make script to compare [[transaction]]'s
- [ ] [[refactor]] the controller
	- [x] refactor directly in the controller 🔼
	- [ ] `move` to a **separate** class
	- [ ] tests? 🔼
- [x] use `Geo API` to retrive required information
	- [x] `coordinates`, `street`, `iris_id`
- [x] move on to `estima processing` - [[study estima processing]]
- [x] think 🤔 about <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tests</mark>
