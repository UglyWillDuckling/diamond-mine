#concept/programming

An abstract concept that tries to convey the idea of a geometric shape applied to [[programming code|code]].

The shape is physically represented as the `shape` of the code on  screen but the meaning of the shape changes depending on context, e.g. the [[programming language]].

The utility of the `shape` concept comes from its ability to represent **elements of code** as geometric shapes which in turn allows the person viewing the code to quickly and easily 'see' and deduce the **major elements** of a program in an abstract way. 

Example:
	
    target ... : dependencies ...
            command
            ...
