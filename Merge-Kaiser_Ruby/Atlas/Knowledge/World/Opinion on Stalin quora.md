No. 

[[Stalin]] killed AT LEAST 9 million people and we aren't counting police purges and “discipline battalions" of officers tasked with shooting any Soviet soldier who fell back from the front line, both of which occurred during World War II.

**Socialism was doing fine** before Stalin seized power. ==He bears the brunt of responsibility for The Great Famine and the GULAG system==. 
Lenin had promised to end the great famines of the past and did. **Even if people had little to eat, the starvation and pogroms commonplace under the tsarist monarchy were gone**. 
**Stalin managed to bring it back under communism**. Which is nearly impossible to do unless done with intent.

Workers owning the means of production was anathema to the Stalinist regime. He and his cronies lived almost identically to the tsarist monarchy with the exception of clothing and the peasants still had nothing and were brutally punished for this accident of birth. He did what Mao did and suspiciously “purged" his “enemies" which happened to be the hungry. Can't have a famine if you kill all the hungry people now, can you?

His GULAG bullshit also managed to jail….wait for it……….the same exact types the tsarist monarchy jailed. You know, poets, journalists, rebellious women, gay people, the disabled, writers, charismatic labor organizers, dissenters, scholars, teachers, charity workers etc. Odd. Why would a “communist" live like a tsar and jail all the same “enemies of the government” the tsar did? How very very odd. Isn't that a bit suspicious?

Stalin managed to defile everything Lenin had done. The worst Lenin could truly be criticized for was his mismanagement of what should be done with the Romanovs. He transported them several times in an attempt to avoid bloodshed but the White Army, despite having VERY little evidence of their supposed goal of reinstating the Romanov dynasty kept claiming that was their aim. No troops or agents were ever deployed anywhere near the imprisoned Romanovs despite a small guard and very few Bolshevik troops to do anything more than guard the unarmed family. There wasn't enough troop strength to deal with even a small element of the White Army so this reinstatement plan might have been a simple power grab trying to claim traditional rights to the hierarchy in Russia during turmoil. Regardless, Lenin didn't act decisively at all and had the family killed in the end despite never once having to fight off incoming rescue squads sent to retrieve the Romanovs.

The left needs to get its shit together. Either we favor and reward the corporate capitalist lackey dems or we become Stalin and Mao worshipping tankies. Its gross and vile. It's like asking a conservative pastor to harm you again and give you a spanking while you call him daddy. It's disgusting and we need it to stop. Stalin was not a communist. The number one thing you must do to be a communist is ensure the profit of labor goes directly to the laborer.

Stalin could have been cruel but correct and NOT a murdering shithead. Do you know how to deal with capitalist thieves stealing the profits of labor from the workers? You annihilate any version of income based on the labor of others demoting the wealthy to a position of work or die. You grin and cajole while soft fat old men learn to do something…like serving cheeseburgers for a living. You don't murder millions and give the capitalist criminals a victim card to go whining to capitalist criminal countries. Stalin did more to give the conservatives a reason to complain than nearly anyone else.

Stalin proved for the billionth time that insecure old men are the most pathetic beings on the planet and need to be ignored and left to slowly wilt away. Screw Stalin.
