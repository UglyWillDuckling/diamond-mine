The early life of a Mourning Cloak begins as a ‘spiny elm caterpillar’, notable for its spiny black body adorned with a distinctive row of reddish-orange dots along its back. Equipped with bright red prolegs, its body is a fascinating mix of black spines, white spots, and small hairs, capable of growing **up to two inches in length.**

### Pupa

Transitioning to the pupal stage, the Mourning Cloak chrysalis displays a tan or brownish-gray coloration, with unique red, pointed spikes along its sides. This stage also features a beak-like structure, tubercles, and horns that emerge from the head, reaching **an average size of 0.8 inches**, with some exceeding 1.1 inches.

### Adult Butterfly

In their adult form, Mourning Cloaks showcase a rich maroon or brown hue **when their wings are spread**, bordered by pale yellow edges and accented with black and iridescent blue spots. The underside of their wings presents dull gray striations, maintaining the pale yellow borders. These butterflies do not exhibit sexual dimorphism, making males and females visually similar.

**Sexual Dimorphism:** Not present

**Color and Appearance:** Maroon or brown wings with pale yellow edges and iridescent blue spots **when open**; dull gray with similar borders **when closed**.

**Flight Pattern:** Known for their fast and strong flapping.

### Eggs

The eggs of the Mourning Cloak are initially amber yellow to pale olive green, laid on the upper surface of host plants. Over time, they transition to pink and eventually almost black as they mature.

## How to Identify Mourning Cloak?

Identifying a Mourning Cloak butterfly can be a rewarding experience, made easier by noting its distinctive features. **Look for large, dark maroon or brown wings with pale yellow edges, a unique pattern that is visible when the wings are open.** The presence of bright, iridescent blue spots near the black demarcation between the maroon and yellow parts is a telltale sign. Another key identifier is the underside of the wings, which show dull gray striations but retain the pale yellow edges. Additionally, observing their flight pattern—fast with strong flapping—can aid in identification. Remember, both males and females look alike as there is no sexual dimorphism in this species, making the color and pattern of the wings the primary focus for identification.
