> If you need to revert multiple pull requests (PRs) on GitHub and later "revert the revert," you can streamline the process by merging all the PR reverts into a single PR. Here's a step-by-step guide to do this efficiently:

---

### Step 1: Create a New Branch

Start by creating a new branch where you will apply all the reverts from multiple PRs.
1. Clone your repository locally (if not already cloned):
bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   
2. Check out the branch for the reverts (you can create it from the main or default branch):
```bash
   git checkout -b revert-prs
```
   
### Step 2: Revert the PRs Locally

Each PR merge corresponds to one commit (or multiple commits) in your repository's history. You can revert them one by one.

1. *Find the merge commits*: Go to the pull requests that you want to revert on GitHub and locate their merge commit hashes (can be found in the "Merged" section of the PR details or under the "Commits" tab).
2. *Revert each merge commit*:
   Use the git revert command for each merge commit hash you want to revert:
bash
   git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
   
   The -m 1 flag is used for merge commits and indicates which parent (usually parent 1) should be kept. Without this flag, the git revert command will fail.
   Repeat this step for all the merge commits you need to revert.
   Example:
bash
   git revert -m 1 abc1234
   git revert -m 1 def5678
   git revert -m 1 ghi9101
   
3. Resolve any conflicts*: If there are conflicts during the revert process, resolve them manually, commit the fixes, and continue:
bash
   # After resolving conflicts
   git add .
   git commit --continue
   
### Step 3: Push the Revert Branch to GitHub
ts to GitHub:
bash
git push origin revert-prs

### Step 4: Open a Single Revert PR
Now, create a single PR from your revert-prs branch to the main branch (or the one youâ€™re reverting from). This will effectively bundle all the reverts into one PR for review and merge.

### *Step 5: Revert the Revert*
If you need to later "revert the revert" (i.e., reapply the original changes), you can do so efficiently:
1. After the "revert PR" has been merged, you can revert the revert commit(s) using the same procedure.
2. This creates a clean and structured history where you can easily undo and redo changes as necessary:
bash
   git checkout -b revert-reverts
   git revert -m 1 <revert-merge-commit-hash>  # Revert the revert for each relevant merge
   git push origin revert-reverts
   
3. Open another PR for the revert-revert branch (which restores the original changes).

### Alternative Approach: Rebase or Cherry-Pick PR Commits

If each PR is just a few commits, you can rebase or cherry-pick those commits into a single branch for clarity instead of reverting. However, this approach is more manual and less clean than using the revert mechanism described above.

### *Automation Option*
If you frequently revert multiple PRs, you can automate this process with a script. For example:
```
bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to revert multiple PRs

# Array of merge commit hashes to revert
MERGE_COMMITS=("abc1234" "def5678" "ghi9101")

# Create a new revert branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b revert-prs

# Revert each commit
for commit in "${MERGE_COMMITS[@]}"; do
  echo "Reverting commit: $commit"
  git revert -m 1 $commit || exit 1  # Exit if conflicts occur
done
```

# Push the branch
git push origin revert-prs
echo "Revert branch 'revert-prs' pushed. Create a PR to merge it."
Save the script as revert_prs.sh, make it executable (chmod +x revert_prs.sh), and run it.
---
### *Conclusion*
- *To revert multiple PRs*: Use git revert for each merge commit and create a single "Revert PR."
- *To undo this revert later*: Revert the revert with the same process, creating another PR to reapply the original changes.
- Use automation or scripts if this is a common workflow.
This approach keeps things clean, allows for easy code reviews, and maintains a readable Git history.
