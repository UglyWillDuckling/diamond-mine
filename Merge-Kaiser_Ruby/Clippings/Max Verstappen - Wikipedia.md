Max Emilian Verstappen was born on 30 September 1997 in [Hasselt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselt "Hasselt"), Belgium to [Jos Verstappen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Verstappen "Jos Verstappen") and [Sophie Kumpen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Kumpen "Sophie Kumpen").[^13] [^14] Verstappen's parents separated when he was young, after which he lived with his father. His younger sister, Victoria, lived with their mother.[^15] Verstappen has three younger half-siblings from his father: a sister from Jos's second marriage and a brother and sister from Jos's current marriage.[^16]

His family has a long association with motor sports: his father is a Dutch former Formula One driver, his Belgian mother competed in [karting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing "Kart racing"),[^17] [^18] and his first cousin once removed, [Anthony Kumpen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Kumpen "Anthony Kumpen"), competed in endurance racing and is a two-time [NASCAR Whelen Euro Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Whelen_Euro_Series "NASCAR Whelen Euro Series") champion currently serving as the team manager for [PK Carsport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PK_Carsport "PK Carsport") in Euro Series.[^17] Verstappen initially attended a secondary school in [Maaseik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maaseik "Maaseik"), before moving into [private tutoring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_tutor "Private tutor"); he admitted that he used to [leave class early](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truancy "Truancy") to attend races across Europe with his father.[^19]

### Karting

Verstappen started racing in karts at the age of four and competing in championships at the age of seven. In 2005 he competed in the Mini Junior championship of his home province of [Limburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburg_\(Belgium\) "Limburg (Belgium)"), Belgium [^20] and won the [VAS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders "Flanders") Championship in the same category. In 2006, he repeated his success. In 2007, Verstappen graduated to the [Rotax Max](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotax_Max "Rotax Max") Mini Max class and won the Rotax Max Challenge Belgium [^21] and the Dutch Championship [^22] in that category. In 2008, racing in a [CRG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRG_\(kart_manufacturer\) "CRG (kart manufacturer)") kart entered by his father, Verstappen won the Belgian Cadet Championship,[^23] as well as the Rotax Max Challenge Belgium [^24] and Benelux Karting Series in Mini Max class.[^25] In 2009, Verstappen joined Pex Racing, a CRG customer team. That year, he defended his titles in the Mini Max championships [^26] [^27] and won the Belgian KF5 Championship.[^28]

Verstappen was signed by CRG to race in their factory team and stepped up to international karting in 2010. At the [KF3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF3 "KF3") [World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Karting_World_Championship "FIA Karting World Championship"), Verstappen finished second to the more experienced [Alexander Albon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Albon "Alexander Albon") (who would eventually become his Formula One teammate at Red Bull Racing) [^29] but beat him at the [WSK Euro Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_WSK_Euro_Series "2010 WSK Euro Series") [^30] and also won the WSK World Series, beating [Robert Vișoiu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Vi%C8%99oiu "Robert Vișoiu").[^31] He finished fifth in the [European Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIK-FIA_Karting_European_Championship "CIK-FIA Karting European Championship") and won the WSK Nations Cup [^32] as well as the final of the Bridgestone Cup where during a 28 laps' race in the rain he beat [Dennis Olsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Olsen_\(racing_driver\) "Dennis Olsen (racing driver)") by over 11 seconds.[^33] In 2011, Verstappen won the [WSK Euro Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_WSK_Euro_Series "2011 WSK Euro Series") ahead of [Esteban Ocon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon "Esteban Ocon") in a [Parilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_American_Motor_Engineering "Italian American Motor Engineering") -powered CRG kart.[^34] However, it was not a successful year for him, as he finished 14th in the [European Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIK-FIA_Karting_European_Championship "CIK-FIA Karting European Championship") and got taken out in the [World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Karting_World_Championship "FIA Karting World Championship") by [Charles Leclerc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc "Charles Leclerc").

In the following year, Verstappen joined the Intrepid Driver Program to race in the [KF2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF2 "KF2") and [KZ2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KZ2 "KZ2") classes. He won the [WSK Master Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSK_Super_Master_Series "WSK Super Master Series") in the KF2 class, beating the CRG driver Felice Tiene.[^35] Verstappen won the South Garda Winter Cup in the KF2 class, beating [Dennis Olsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Olsen_\(racing_driver\) "Dennis Olsen (racing driver)") and [Antonio Fuoco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Fuoco "Antonio Fuoco").[^36] [^37] He finished sixth in the [WSK Euro Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSK_Euro_Series "WSK Euro Series").[^38] He was the youngest driver taking part in the World Championship in [KF1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF1 "KF1") class and finished eight.[^39]

In July 2012, it was announced that Verstappen would leave Intrepid. After a short stint with CRG-built [Zanardi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Zanardi "Alex Zanardi") karts, Verstappen returned to the factory CRG team.[^40] He finished second at the World Cup in the KF2 class [^41] and competed at the SKUSA SuperNationals in the KZ2 class in a CRG, finishing 21st.

Verstappen *(left)* completed a record-breaking karting season in 2013 with [CRG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRG_\(kart_manufacturer\) "CRG (kart manufacturer)"), pictured at the [KF World Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Championship#FIA_Karting_World_champions_\(direct_drive_&_primary_category\) "Karting World Championship").

In 2013, Verstappen completed a record-breaking season in karting, having progressed to the senior [KF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF2 "KF2") and [KZ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KZ_\(karting\) "KZ (karting)") categories. Aged 15, he won three [CIK-FIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIK-FIA "CIK-FIA") championships in a single season: two [European Championships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_European_Championship "Karting European Championship") and a [World Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Championship "Karting World Championship"); an unprecedented feat in the history of the discipline.[^42] He became the first driver since his father [Jos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Verstappen "Jos Verstappen") to win two European Championships in the same season, and the first to do so in both the primary [direct-drive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-drive "Direct-drive") and [gearbox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gearbox "Gearbox") classes. By winning the 2013 [KZ World Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Championship#125_Gearbox_FIA_Karting_world_champions_and_World_Cup_winners "Karting World Championship") at [Varennes-sur-Allier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varennes-sur-Allier "Varennes-sur-Allier"), beating [Charles Leclerc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc "Charles Leclerc") to the title, Verstappen became the youngest-ever driver to win the gearbox World Championship.[^43] [^44]

Further adding to his accolades in 2013, Verstappen also finished third at the [KF World Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Championship#FIA_Karting_World_champions_\(direct_drive_&_primary_category\) "Karting World Championship") after being disqualified for a move on [Nicklas Nielsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicklas_Nielsen "Nicklas Nielsen") in the final race, having won the opening round and pre-final.[^45] This was the only championship he failed to win in 2013 whilst completing all rounds. Verstappen won the South Garda Winter Cup in [KF2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF2 "KF2"),[^46] as well as the [WSK Euro Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSK_Euro_Series "WSK Euro Series") and the [WSK Super Master Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSK_Super_Master_Series "WSK Super Master Series") in [KZ1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KZ1_\(karting\) "KZ1 (karting)") and [KZ2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KZ2 "KZ2"), respectively.[^47] [^48]

He also considered an offer from [Mercedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One") to join their [driver development programme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Junior_Team "Mercedes Junior Team").[^66]

Verstappen (pictured at the [2015 Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2015 Malaysian Grand Prix")) became the youngest driver in Formula One history at the [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Australian_Grand_Prix "2015 Australian Grand Prix"), aged 17.

Verstappen then became the [youngest driver to start a World Championship race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_start_a_race "List of Formula One driver records") through joining Toro Rosso's race drivers' line-up with [Carlos Sainz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr. "Carlos Sainz Jr.") as his teammate, in his Grand Prix debut as a full-time driver at the [2015 Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Australian_Grand_Prix "2015 Australian Grand Prix") at the age of 17 years, 166 days—breaking [Jaime Alguersuari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Alguersuari "Jaime Alguersuari") 's existing record by almost two years.[^67] In this first race, Verstappen ran in points-scoring positions until he was forced to retire due to an engine failure.[^68] However, at the subsequent race in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2015 Malaysian Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified sixth and finished the race in seventh place, scoring his first Formula One points aged 17 years, 180 days, breaking the record of the then- [youngest driver to score World Championship points](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_drivers_to_score_points "List of Formula One driver records").[^69]

On 5 May 2016, following the [Russian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Russian_Grand_Prix "2016 Russian Grand Prix"), Red Bull Racing announced that Verstappen would be replacing Daniil Kvyat from the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2016 Spanish Grand Prix") onwards, with Kvyat returning to Toro Rosso.[^80] According to Red Bull Team Principal [Christian Horner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner "Christian Horner"), "Max has proven to be an outstanding young talent. His performance at Toro Rosso has been impressive so far and we are pleased to give him the opportunity to drive for Red Bull Racing." [^81] After qualifying fourth for the Spanish Grand Prix,[^82] Verstappen rose to second behind teammate [Daniel Ricciardo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo "Daniel Ricciardo") on the opening lap after Mercedes teammates [Lewis Hamilton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton "Lewis Hamilton") and [Nico Rosberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg "Nico Rosberg") crashed out of the race.[^83] Verstappen took the race lead as he was placed on a two-stop rather than the same three-stop strategy as Ricciardo, and he held off [Ferrari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari "Scuderia Ferrari") 's [Kimi Räikkönen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen "Kimi Räikkönen") in the later stages of the race to take his first Formula One victory.[^84] [^85] By doing so he displaced [Sebastian Vettel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel "Sebastian Vettel") as the youngest driver ever to win a Formula One Grand Prix at the age of 18 years and 228 days.[^86]

In his first eight races with Red Bull, he achieved six top-five finishes, including four podiums.[^87]

During the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2016 Belgian Grand Prix"), Verstappen collided with Räikkönen at the first corner, pushed Vettel, Räikkönen and Pérez wide at *Les Combes*, and aggressively blocked Räikkönen on the Kemmel straight.[^88] Verstappen was criticised for his driving, with Räikkönen saying that he was "going to cause a huge accident sooner or later." Christian Horner noted that the driving was "on the edge", and that Verstappen will "look at it and learn for future races." [^89] In September, Formula One director [Charlie Whiting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Whiting "Charlie Whiting") called in Verstappen for a discussion, and later gave him a 'gentle warning' due to his aggressive driving.[^90] However, in October, drivers' concerns about Verstappen's defensive tactics led the FIA to disallow moving under braking.[^91]

At the [2016 Brazilian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2016 Brazilian Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified fourth.[^92] In a rain affected race, he almost hit the barrier after he slid on the main straight due to a loss of traction, causing [oversteer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversteer "Oversteer").[^93] After an additional tyre change from intermediates back to rain tyres, he ran in 16th place with just 15 laps remaining. Verstappen then made several overtakes in quick succession during the closing laps to eventually finish on the podium in third place.[^94] He received considerable praise for his performance: rival team Mercedes' team principal, [Toto Wolff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff "Toto Wolff"), labelled it "The Verstappen Show", and described Verstappen's drive as "physics..being redefined".[^95] [^96] [^97] However, Verstappen came under criticism from four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who stated that Verstappen had pushed him off the track at the Junção corner late in the race. The race stewards did not share Vettel's view and decided that no reprimand was warranted.[^98]

Verstappen took his second career victory at the [Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2017 Malaysian Grand Prix") in [2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship "2017 Formula One World Championship").

During the first 14 races of the 2017 season, Verstappen suffered seven retirements, four due to mechanical issues,[^99] and three due to first lap collisions in [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2017 Spanish Grand Prix"), [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2017 Austrian Grand Prix") and [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2017 Singapore Grand Prix").[^100] Of the races he finished, however, he claimed a third place in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2017 Chinese Grand Prix"), and in another five races he finished fourth or fifth.[^87]

From the [Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2017 Malaysian Grand Prix") onward, Verstappen enjoyed a surge of success. He won his second Formula One race at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix, a day after his 20th birthday, passing then three-time champion Lewis Hamilton for the lead in the early stages of the race.[^101] He finished second in the following [race in Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2017 Japanese Grand Prix").[^102] He then finished third at the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_Grand_Prix "2017 United States Grand Prix") Grand Prix, but was classified fourth after his final lap overtake on Kimi Räikkönen was deemed illegal.[^103] He won his third Formula One race at the [Mexican Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mexican_Grand_Prix "2017 Mexican Grand Prix"), after passing [Sebastian Vettel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel "Sebastian Vettel") on the opening lap.[^104]

Verstappen at the [2018 Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2018 Austrian Grand Prix")

In the first six races of the [2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship "2018 Formula One World Championship") season, Verstappen had been involved in at least one incident in each race. In [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix "2018 Australian Grand Prix"), he qualified fourth but fell behind [Kevin Magnussen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen "Kevin Magnussen") at the start.[^105] In his attempts to retake the position he ran wide multiple times and damaged his car, with a spin causing him to fall further down the order. He recovered to eventually finish the race in sixth place.[^106] At the next race in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2018 Bahrain Grand Prix"), he crashed during qualifying and started in 15th place.[^107] He had a productive first lap after which he found himself in the points while challenging Lewis Hamilton. He attempted an overtake on the reigning World Champion at the start of lap two, but collided with the Mercedes driver and suffered a puncture that ultimately led to suspension damage, forcing him out of the race.[^108]

At the next race in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2018 Chinese Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified fifth and had moved up to third at the end of the first lap.[^109] Both Red Bull drivers pitted for fresh tyres during a safety car which left them with a tyre advantage over the front-runners ahead. In an overtake attempt on [Sebastian Vettel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel "Sebastian Vettel") for third place, Verstappen collided with the championship leader, causing him to fall to eighth and receive a 10-second penalty.[^110] He recovered to fourth place, with his penalty causing him to be classified fifth. Teammate Ricciardo went on to win the race.[^111] In [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), Verstappen was embroiled in a race-long battle with Ricciardo for fourth place. After numerous position changes between the two teammates during the race, Ricciardo ran into the back of Verstappen during an overtake attempt from which the Dutchman aggressively defended, causing the retirement of both cars.[^112] Both drivers were blamed by the team and reprimanded by the stewards.[^113] Verstappen bounced back in [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2018 Spanish Grand Prix") with his first podium of the season by finishing third behind the Mercedes drivers, holding off [Sebastian Vettel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel "Sebastian Vettel"). However, the race was also not without incident as he had run into the back of [Lance Stroll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll "Lance Stroll") during the virtual safety car period, causing minor front wing damage.[^114]

In [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2018 Monaco Grand Prix"), Verstappen made another error and crashed near the end of the third free practice session in an incident which closely resembled a crash he had at the same spot [two years earlier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monaco_Grand_Prix#Qualifying "2016 Monaco Grand Prix").[^115] His team could not repair his car in time for qualifying and Verstappen had to start the race from the back of the grid.[^116] Verstappen did not compete and did not set a lap time in qualifying, therefore teammate Ricciardo pressed home Red Bull's advantage at the track by taking [pole position](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position "Pole position") and the race win. Verstappen managed to salvage two points by finishing ninth place, overtaking six cars on track.[^117] Team principal Christian Horner commented on Verstappen's start of the season, saying he "needed to stop making these mistakes" and that he could "learn from his teammate", while [Helmut Marko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko "Helmut Marko"), head of driver development at Red Bull, said that Verstappen was "too impatient".[^116] Verstappen now lay in sixth place in the championship with 35 points, only three points ahead of [Fernando Alonso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso "Fernando Alonso") in the McLaren, and 37 points behind his teammate in third, who had taken two wins in the first six races.[^118] [^119]

In [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2018 Canadian Grand Prix"), Verstappen topped all three practice sessions and qualified third, two-tenths off Sebastian Vettel in pole position.[^120] He eventually finished third and set the fastest lap of the race.[^121] The following race in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_French_Grand_Prix "2018 French Grand Prix") brought him second place.[^122] In [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2018 Austrian Grand Prix") —Red Bull's home track, he started fourth on the grid, passed Kimi Räikkönen before taking advantage of retirement from [Valtteri Bottas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas "Valtteri Bottas") and a botched pit-stop strategy by Lewis Hamilton, who later had to retire from fourth place, to claim the fourth race victory of his career.[^123] In [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_British_Grand_Prix "2018 British Grand Prix"), Verstappen was plagued by issues, finishing the first practice session early due to a gearbox problem and crashing in the second practice session before retiring from the race due to a brake problem.[^124] He would then finish fourth in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_German_Grand_Prix "2018 German Grand Prix") after strategy errors let a recovering Hamilton get past him as he went on to win the race.[^125] Verstappen ended the first half of the season with a retirement in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2018 Hungarian Grand Prix") and was narrowly behind his teammate in the championship due to his own recent resurgence and Ricciardo's unreliability.[^126] [^127]

Verstappen enjoyed a very strong second half of the season, achieving podium finishes in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2018 Belgian Grand Prix"), [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2018 Singapore Grand Prix"), [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2018 Japanese Grand Prix") and the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_Grand_Prix "2018 United States Grand Prix"), the latter of which he achieved second place having started from 18th on the grid due to a suspension failure in qualifying.[^128] Following the qualifying session at the [Mexican Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Mexican_Grand_Prix "2018 Mexican Grand Prix"), Verstappen revealed that a mechanical problem with his Red Bull under braking cost him any chance of becoming the youngest-ever Formula One pole-sitter. As a result, Ricciardo beat Verstappen to pole position by just 0.026 seconds.[^129] [^130] Verstappen had a better start than Ricciardo and took the lead of the race into the first corner, overtaking the fast-starting Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen earned his fifth career win in Mexico.[^131] [^132] He was poised to win the [2018 Brazilian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2018 Brazilian Grand Prix"), having overtaken Räikkönen, Vettel, Bottas, and Hamilton. However, he collided with [Force India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India "Force India") driver [Esteban Ocon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon "Esteban Ocon") who was trying to unlap himself on faster tyres.[^133] Ocon received a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for the incident. After the collision with Ocon, Verstappen finished in second place behind Hamilton. During an argument with Ocon after the race, Verstappen pushed the Force India driver, for which he was given two days of "public service" as a penalty by the FIA.[^134] He then finished his season with another podium as he finished third in Abu Dhabi.[^135]

Verstappen ended the season in fourth place in the championship with 249 points, claiming two wins, eleven podium finishes, and two fastest laps.[^136]

Verstappen at the [2019 Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2019 Hungarian Grand Prix"), where he started on pole position for the first time in his career

In [2019](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship "2019 Formula One World Championship") Red Bull switched from Renault to [Honda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One "Honda in Formula One") power units.[^137] After Ricciardo moved to the [Renault](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One "Renault in Formula One") team for 2019, Verstappen was joined at Red Bull by [Pierre Gasly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly "Pierre Gasly").[^138] Verstappen qualified in fourth and finished third in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix "2019 Australian Grand Prix"), the first podium finish for a [Honda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One "Honda in Formula One") -powered driver since the [2008 British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_British_Grand_Prix "2008 British Grand Prix").[^139] Verstappen was on course for a second third-place finish in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2019 Bahrain Grand Prix") before a late safety car prevented him from overtaking Charles Leclerc's ailing Ferrari, keeping him in fourth place.[^140] Two more fourth-place finishes followed in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2019 Chinese Grand Prix") and [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), and a podium in [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2019 Spanish Grand Prix") in third place.[^141] [^142] [^143] In [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2019 Monaco Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified in third place. He was released into the path of Valtteri Bottas during the drivers' pit stops, gaining second place but receiving a 5-second penalty as a result. Verstappen crossed the line in second place but was demoted to fourth by the penalty.[^144]

In [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2019 Canadian Grand Prix"), Verstappen's final lap in the second qualifying session was hampered by a red flag brought out by [Kevin Magnussen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen "Kevin Magnussen") 's crash. This caused Verstappen to qualify 11th and start the race in ninth place.[^145] [^146] He later recovered to finish fifth.[^147] In [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_French_Grand_Prix "2019 French Grand Prix") he started and finished in fourth place.[^148] In [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2019 Austrian Grand Prix"), Verstappen started third but suffered a poor start, dropping down to eighth. After a charge towards the front, he made his way up to second before controversially passing Leclerc for the lead of the race with three laps to go.[^149] This marked the first Honda-powered race victory since the [2006 Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2006 Hungarian Grand Prix").[^150] [^151] In [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_British_Grand_Prix "2019 British Grand Prix"), Verstappen, running in third place,[^152] was hit from behind during an overtake attempt by Sebastian Vettel and spun into the gravel. Verstappen was able to continue and crossed the line in fifth place.[^153]

The wet and chaotic [German Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix "2019 German Grand Prix") began similarly to the race in Austria for Verstappen, as a poor start caused him to fall behind. However, he would inherit the lead midway through the race after a crash by race leader Hamilton.[^154] Verstappen would go on to extend his lead after the track began to dry, claiming his second victory of the season.[^155] In [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2019 Hungarian Grand Prix"), he claimed his maiden [pole position](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_polesitters "List of Formula One polesitters") —becoming the [first Dutch driver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_drivers_from_the_Netherlands "Formula One drivers from the Netherlands") to do so—and led most of the race before being passed in the closing laps by Hamilton, who had made another stop for fresh tyres in a gamble to catch the leader.[^156] [^157] [^158]

Verstappen on the podium after winning the [2019 Brazilian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2019 Brazilian Grand Prix")

Before the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2019 Belgian Grand Prix"), Verstappen received a new teammate in Alexander Albon after Pierre Gasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso.[^159] In the race, Verstappen had a poor start and collided with Kimi Räikkönen at the first corner, resulting in suspension damage and causing Verstappen's first retirement of the season.[^160] In [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix "2019 Italian Grand Prix"), he did not set a time during qualifying after his car lost power in Q1, but he was already required to start from the back of the grid due to an engine component penalty.[^161] After damaging his front wing on the first lap, he recovered to finish the race in eighth place.[^162] Third and fourth-place finishes followed in [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2019 Singapore Grand Prix") and [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Russian_Grand_Prix "2019 Russian Grand Prix") respectively.[^163] [^164] After suffering damage in a first-lap collision with Charles Leclerc in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2019 Japanese Grand Prix"), Verstappen suffered his second retirement of the season.[^165]

In [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mexican_Grand_Prix "2019 Mexican Grand Prix"), he qualified in first place after setting the fastest lap-time of the session, before being handed a grid penalty for ignoring [yellow flags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Yellow_flag "Racing flags") after a crash by Valtteri Bottas.[^166] Verstappen suffered a puncture early in the race after making contact with Bottas, falling to the back of the field before eventually recovering to sixth place.[^167] A third-place finish in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_Grand_Prix "2019 United States Grand Prix") followed, before Verstappen took the second pole position of his career with a 1:07.508 pole lap time in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2019 Brazilian Grand Prix").[^168] [^169] In a chaotic race, he passed Lewis Hamilton for the lead on two occasions before going on to claim his third victory of the season.[^170] Verstappen ended the season with a second-place finish in [Abu Dhabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix").[^171]

Verstappen finished the 2019 season in third place in the championship with 278 points. He claimed three race victories, nine podium finishes, two pole positions, and three fastest laps.[^172]

Verstappen at [pre-season testing in 2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_pre-season_testing "2020 Formula One pre-season testing")

Verstappen continued to race for Red Bull in [2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship "2020 Formula One World Championship"), alongside Albon. At the [2020 Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2020 Austrian Grand Prix"), he started second, but retired early in the race after a flywheel-related problem caused an electronic issue within the power unit.[^173] Honda introduced countermeasures in response to the retirement.[^174]

At the [2020 Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2020 Hungarian Grand Prix"), he crashed in wet conditions during the [formation lap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_lap "Formation lap") while he was on his way to the starting grid,[^175] but he was able to drive the car back to the grid where his mechanics fixed the suspension of the car in the short time that was left before the start of the race.[^176] After the repairs, Verstappen progressed from seventh place on the grid to second place by the end of the race.[^177] Verstappen won the [70th Anniversary Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/70th_Anniversary_Grand_Prix "70th Anniversary Grand Prix") at [Silverstone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit "Silverstone Circuit"), having started from fourth.[^178]

Verstappen clinched second place at the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2020 Spanish Grand Prix"), after qualifying in third.[^179] At the [2020 Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2020 Belgian Grand Prix"), he scored a podium in third place, following his third place on the starting grid.[^180] He suffered from two consecutive DNFs at the [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italian_Grand_Prix "2020 Italian Grand Prix") and [Tuscan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix "2020 Tuscan Grand Prix") Grands Prix after which he lost second place in the Championship.[^181] [^182] At the [Russian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russian_Grand_Prix "2020 Russian Grand Prix"), Verstappen finished the race in second, his seventh podium finish of 2020.[^183] At the [Eifel Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Eifel_Grand_Prix "2020 Eifel Grand Prix"), Verstappen finished in second after qualifying in third.[^184] He also managed to get the fastest lap of the race.[^185] At the [Portuguese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Portuguese_Grand_Prix "2020 Portuguese Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified third, however a poor first lap meant that he dropped back down the order to fifth place. He recovered to third and took his 40th podium in Formula 1.[^186] At the [Emilia Romagna Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix "2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"), Verstappen looked set to claim second due to [Valtteri Bottas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas "Valtteri Bottas") ' ailing Mercedes slowing down, but a sudden puncture denied him any chance of a podium finish; Verstappen spun, resulting in his fourth retirement of the 2020 season.[^187]

During Free Practice for the Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen was criticised for comments he made on the team radio after a collision with [Lance Stroll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll "Lance Stroll"), where he used the words "retard" and "mongol" in response to the clash. Verstappen admitted following the session that the word choices he used were "not correct". The Mongolian government and the Mongol identity asked Verstappen to apologise for the comments; the Mongolian government also urged the [FIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile "Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile") to take action on the comments he made.[^188] [^189]

Verstappen finished the 2020 season in third place in the championship with 214 points. He claimed two race victories, eleven podium finishes, one pole position, and three fastest laps.[^190]

Verstappen at the 2021 Austrian Grand Prix

At the [Bahrain Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2021 Bahrain Grand Prix"), Verstappen topped all the practice sessions and subsequently took a career fourth pole position. This was the first time he achieved back-to-back pole positions.[^191] He fought Lewis Hamilton for the race victory, and on lap 53 Verstappen overtook Hamilton, but went off track whilst doing so, resulting in him being instructed by race control to let Hamilton back into the lead and ultimately finishing second behind Hamilton.[^192] At the next race, the [Emilia Romagna Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix "2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified third with teammate [Sergio Pérez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez "Sergio Pérez") second, marking the first time he was out-qualified by a teammate since the [2019 Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix "2019 Italian Grand Prix").[^193] At the race start, Verstappen was able to pass both Pérez and pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton to take the lead. He remained in the lead after the first round of pit stops as well as the restart, following the race being suspended on lap 33. Rival Hamilton finished second, reducing his championship lead over Verstappen to one point.[^194] In the following [Portuguese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Portuguese_Grand_Prix "2021 Portuguese Grand Prix"), Verstappen finished second after a long battle with Lewis Hamilton.[^195] At the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2021 Spanish Grand Prix"), the battle between Verstappen and Hamilton continued, with Hamilton employing a faster two-stop strategy versus Verstappen's one-stop race. This provided Hamilton the advantage of faster tyres, allowing him to overtake Verstappen with several laps remaining in the race. Hamilton took the victory, with Verstappen taking second and the fastest lap, increasing Hamilton's championship lead to 14 points.[^196]

At the next race in [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2021 Monaco Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified second behind [Charles Leclerc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc "Charles Leclerc"),[^197] but Leclerc suffered a driveshaft failure on the way to the grid and was unable to start the race. Verstappen controlled the race from the front on the way to victory. Hamilton (who qualified seventh) finished seventh, though claiming an extra championship point by setting the fastest race lap. The result enabled Verstappen to become the [first Dutch driver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_drivers_from_the_Netherlands "Formula One drivers from the Netherlands") to lead the World Drivers' Championship,[^198] by a margin of four points over Hamilton.[^199] At the [Azerbaijan Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified third behind Leclerc and Hamilton.[^200] Verstappen and Hamilton passed Leclerc in the opening laps before Verstappen took the lead by way of a faster pitstop. Verstappen would comfortably hold the lead until lap 46 when he suffered a tyre failure causing him to crash at high speed and retire.[^201] A mistake by Hamilton on the restart dropped him to last place, meaning Verstappen maintained his championship lead.[^202] Verstappen took pole for the [French Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_French_Grand_Prix "2021 French Grand Prix").[^203] Verstappen's mistake on the first lap allowed Hamilton to take the lead which Verstappen retook during the pit stop phase. Verstappen pitted for a second time from the lead and set after the Mercedes duo, overtaking Hamilton for the lead on lap 52 of 53.[^204] He also took the fastest lap point, extending his championship lead to twelve points [^205] and achieving the first [hat-trick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Pole,_win,_and_fastest_lap_in_same_race "List of Formula One driver records") of his career.[^206] Verstappen clinched pole position again at the [Styrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Styrian_Grand_Prix "2021 Styrian Grand Prix") and led the race from start to finish, to give him his fourth win of the season and further extend his lead to 18 points.[^207]

Verstappen took pole position at the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2021 Austrian Grand Prix"), led every lap from start to finish, set the fastest lap, and won the race for his first career [grand slam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_\(Formula_One\) "Grand slam (Formula One)"),[^208] [^209] being the youngest to do so.[^210] With the win, Verstappen also became the first driver to win three races in three consecutive weekends, starting at the French Grand Prix on 20 June, then the Styrian Grand Prix on 27 June and ending with the Austrian Grand Prix on 4 July.[^211] [^212] At the next race; the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix "2021 British Grand Prix"), Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision at the *[Copse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit#Circuit "Silverstone Circuit")* corner with Hamilton on the first lap. This resulted in a 51 [*g*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force "G-force") (500  [m/s <sup>2</sup>](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second_squared "Metre per second squared"); 1,600  [ft/s <sup>2</sup>](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_per_second_squared "Foot per second squared")) impact with the barrier.[^213] [^214] He was taken to the Silverstone circuit's medical centre after the crash and was then taken to Coventry hospital for precautionary checks and further assessment, before eventually being discharged at 22:00 local time on Sunday night.[^215] Hamilton would go on to win the race, reducing Verstappen's lead in the championship to eight points.[^216] At the next race, the [Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2021 Hungarian Grand Prix"), Verstappen's car suffered damage in a multi-car collision on lap 1, where Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas was deemed at fault. He ended the race in tenth which was promoted to ninth after Sebastian Vettel was disqualified. The outcome of the race allowed Hamilton to take the lead of the championship.[^217]

Following the summer break, Verstappen qualified on pole at the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2021 Belgian Grand Prix"), ahead of Williams driver [George Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_\(racing_driver\) "George Russell (racing driver)") in second and Lewis Hamilton in third.[^218] The race was run for three laps, all behind the safety car, with the race official race results taken from the running order at the end of the first lap, with Hamilton and Verstappen both retaining their qualifying positions. As less than 75% of the race distance was completed, half points were awarded, resulting in Verstappen closing the gap to Hamilton to three points.[^219] At the [Dutch Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Dutch_Grand_Prix "2021 Dutch Grand Prix") Verstappen again qualified on pole, beating Hamilton by 0.038 seconds.[^220] During the race Verstappen was able to fend off attacks from both Mercedes drivers to take the win, taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship by three points.[^221] For the [Russian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix "2021 Russian Grand Prix"), Verstappen was required to start at the back of the grid for exceeding his quota of power unit components.[^222] He made his way back up the field, and after taking an early pit stop for intermediate tyres late in the race, he finished second.[^223] At the [Turkish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Turkish_Grand_Prix "2021 Turkish Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified second with Bottas on pole.[^224] With the race being run in wet conditions and the drivers on intermediate tyres the whole race, Verstappen finished second behind Bottas, taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship by six points as Hamilton finished fifth.[^225]

Verstappen battling with Lewis Hamilton for the lead at the 2021 United States Grand Prix

At the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Grand_Prix "2021 United States Grand Prix"), Verstappen took pole position in qualifying, edging Hamilton by 0.209 seconds.[^226] Verstappen won the race and extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to twelve points as Hamilton finished second with the fastest lap.[^227] At the [2021 Mexico City Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix "2021 Mexico City Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified third with a gap to pole-sitter Bottas of 0.350 seconds.[^228] Verstappen's main rival Hamilton qualified second. At the start, Verstappen took the lead from Bottas and Hamilton into turn 1, and won the race; and as a result extended his lead in the championship to 19 points.[^229]

Verstappen and Hamilton each entered the final round of the championship—the [Abu Dhabi Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix") at [Yas Marina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit "Yas Marina Circuit") —on exactly 369.5 points, with Verstappen leading on countback.[^230] Verstappen qualified on pole position by nearly four-tenths of a second, but had a slow start and lost the lead to Hamilton into turn one. He attempted to re-pass Hamilton at turn six, who controversially cut the track and maintained the lead without penalty; the stewards deemed no advantage was gained, amidst Verstappen and Red Bull's complaints. Verstappen was trailing Hamilton by over 10 seconds until a safety car was called with five laps remaining, following a crash involving [Nicholas Latifi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Latifi "Nicholas Latifi"). The withdrawal of the safety car and subsequent resumption of the race with one lap remaining was met with further controversy; race director [Michael Masi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Masi "Michael Masi") only allowed a certain number of lapped cars through, saving time to allow the race to be restarted once the track had been cleared. Verstappen passed Hamilton at turn five of the final lap of the race to become the [first World Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_drivers_from_the_Netherlands "Formula One drivers from the Netherlands") and the [34th overall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Drivers%27_Championship "World Drivers' Championship").[^231] [^232] Mercedes protested and stated intention to appeal the race results, arguing all lapped cars should have been allowed to pass under the regulations, but Red Bull counter-argued that this was not specified in the regulations with the word "any" used as opposed to "all".[^233] The protest was subsequently rejected, confirming Verstappen as the World Drivers' Champion; the FIA amended the wording of the rule from 2022 onwards.[^234] Verstappen was named the best driver of the season by *[Autosport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosport "Autosport")* and *The Race*,[^235] [^236] whilst also topping official polls of fellow drivers and team principals.[^237] [^238] [Mark Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hughes_\(journalist\) "Mark Hughes (journalist)") of *[Motor Sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Sport_\(magazine\) "Motor Sport (magazine)")* also ranked Verstappen first, describing his season as a "stunning combination of speed and racecraft, totally fearless, incredible tenacity and ability to comeback from adversity".[^239]

Verstappen at the [2022 Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2022 Japanese Grand Prix"), where he won his second World Drivers' Championship

In March 2022, Verstappen signed a five-year contract extension with Red Bull Racing for the 2023 to 2028 seasons.[^11] From this season onward, he would use the number 1 instead of his regular number 33 as the reigning world champion.[^240]

Verstappen retired from second place at the season-opening [Bahrain Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2022 Bahrain Grand Prix") with a fuel system issue. He won the [Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix "2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix"), having benefited from a pit stop during safety car conditions to pass teammate and pole-sitter Pérez, but suffered another fuel-related retirement from second place at the [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_Grand_Prix "2022 Australian Grand Prix"). This left him 46 points behind championship leader Charles Leclerc after three races. Verstappen responded by winning the next three races; he achieved sprint victory and a [grand slam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_\(Formula_One\) "Grand slam (Formula One)") at the [Emilia Romagna Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix "2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"),[^241] won from third on the grid at the [Miami Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Miami_Grand_Prix "2022 Miami Grand Prix") and gained from Leclerc's retirement at the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2022 Spanish Grand Prix") to lead the Drivers' Championship. Further wins came at the [Azerbaijan Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), where Leclerc again retired, and from pole position at the [Canadian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2022 Canadian Grand Prix"). Verstappen qualified second at the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_British_Grand_Prix "2022 British Grand Prix"), but floor damage from running over debris harmed his pace and resulted in a seventh-place finish.[^242] He took pole position at the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2022 Austrian Grand Prix") and won the sprint, but was overtaken by Leclerc in the race and finished second, reducing his championship lead over Leclerc to 38 points.

Following this, Verstappen went on to win five races consecutively. Pole-sitter Leclerc crashed out of the [French Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_French_Grand_Prix "2022 French Grand Prix"), allowing Verstappen to win. Power unit issues meant he qualified tenth for the [Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2022 Hungarian Grand Prix"),[^243] but overtakes in the opening laps and pit stop [undercuts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_motorsport_terms#U "Glossary of motorsport terms") meant he went on to take victory, despite briefly losing the lead after a spin.[^244] He set the fastest qualifying time at the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2022 Belgian Grand Prix") but was demoted to 14th on the grid with a power unit components penalty. Despite this, he progressed to the race lead by lap 12 and went on to win.[^245] He took pole position and his 30th race victory at his home race, the [Dutch Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dutch_Grand_Prix "2022 Dutch Grand Prix"), and then won from seventh on the grid at the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Italian_Grand_Prix "2022 Italian Grand Prix").

Verstappen's winning streak was ended at the [Singapore Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2022 Singapore Grand Prix"). He ran out of fuel in qualifying and started the race eighth.[^246] He lost places at the start and later had to make an extra pit stop due to a tyre lock-up, finishing seventh. Victory from pole at the shortened [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2022 Japanese Grand Prix") gave him a 113-point lead in the standings with four races remaining, securing him his second World Drivers' Championship.[^247] He won the next two races, the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Grand_Prix "2022 United States Grand Prix") and [Mexico City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix "2022 Mexico City Grand Prix") Grands Prix, finished sixth at the [São Paulo Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix "2022 São Paulo Grand Prix") after a collision with Lewis Hamilton, and won the season-ending [Abu Dhabi Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix") from pole.

Abu Dhabi was his fifteenth victory of the year, breaking the record of thirteen race wins in a season shared by Michael Schumacher in [2004](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Formula_One_World_Championship "2004 Formula One World Championship") and Sebastian Vettel in [2013](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Formula_One_World_Championship "2013 Formula One World Championship"). He won the championship with 454 points, beating Lewis Hamilton's [2019](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship "2019 Formula One World Championship") record of 413.[^248]

Verstappen leading the race at the [2023 Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2023 Austrian Grand Prix")

Verstappen remained with Red Bull alongside Sergio Pérez for the 2023 season. His season began with a win from pole at the [Bahrain Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2023 Bahrain Grand Prix"). A driveshaft failure in qualifying at the [Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix "2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix") resulted in a 15th-place start, but he gained positions in the race to finish second behind Pérez.[^249] He again won from pole at the [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Grand_Prix "2023 Australian Grand Prix") despite losing positions to the Mercedes drivers during the race,[^250] but finished second to Pérez, who made a safety car pit stop, at the [Azerbaijan Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix").[^251]

After this began Verstappen's record-breaking win streak. He started ninth at the [Miami Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Miami_Grand_Prix "2023 Miami Grand Prix") as [red flags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Red_flag "Racing flags") in qualifying aborted his lap but passed the drivers ahead including pole-sitter Pérez to win. The next four races, the [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2023 Monaco Grand Prix"), [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2023 Spanish Grand Prix"), [Canadian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2023 Canadian Grand Prix") and [Austrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2023 Austrian Grand Prix") Grands Prix, were won comfortably from pole position by Verstappen, including Red Bull's 100th victory in Canada [^252] and a sprint win in Austria. He took pole at the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_British_Grand_Prix "2023 British Grand Prix") but briefly lost the lead to [Lando Norris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris "Lando Norris") at the start before regaining the position to win. He qualified 0.003 seconds behind Lewis Hamilton at the [Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2023 Hungarian Grand Prix"), but overtook him at the first corner and went on to take victory. He claimed pole and the win in the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2023 Belgian Grand Prix") sprint and set the fastest qualifying time, but started the race sixth due to an engine component penalty. He went on to overtake Pérez to win the race. He won from pole at the rain-affected [Dutch Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dutch_Grand_Prix "2023 Dutch Grand Prix") and was victorious again at the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Italian_Grand_Prix "2023 Italian Grand Prix") despite qualifying behind Carlos Sainz Jr. This victory marked his tenth consecutive win, breaking Sebastian Vettel's record of nine from 2013,[^253] [^254] and Red Bull's fifteenth consecutive win, a record previously held by [McLaren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") with eleven in [1988](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Formula_One_World_Championship "1988 Formula One World Championship").

Both Red Bulls were eliminated in Q2 at the [Singapore Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2023 Singapore Grand Prix") and were unable to make an impression in the race, with Verstappen and Pérez finishing fifth and eighth respectively, ending the winning streak.[^255] This would be the only break in Verstappen's success, as he went on to win the remaining seven races of the season. His victory from pole at the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2023 Japanese Grand Prix") gave Red Bull their sixth Constructors' Championship title.[^256] He clinched his third World Drivers' Championship title at the [Qatar Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Qatar_Grand_Prix "2023 Qatar Grand Prix") sprint despite finishing second to [Oscar Piastri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri "Oscar Piastri"),[^257] then won the race from pole. He won the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Grand_Prix "2023 United States Grand Prix") despite having started sixth due to a lap time deletion in qualifying. He qualified behind both Ferraris at the [Mexico City Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix "2023 Mexico City Grand Prix") but passed both drivers to claim the win. He took pole and victory at the [São Paulo Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix "2023 São Paulo Grand Prix") and won the sprint having overtook pole-sitter [Lando Norris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris "Lando Norris") at the first turn. He started behind Charles Leclerc at the [Las Vegas Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix "2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix") and received a penalty for forcing him off the track, but Verstappen reclaimed the lead to win.

His pole and victory at the season-ending [Abu Dhabi Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix") was his nineteenth win of the year, breaking his own record of fifteen from 2022. He scored 575 points, more than double that of second-placed Pérez and beating his own points-scoring record from 2022.

Verstappen (pictured during the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2024 Austrian Grand Prix")) won seven of the opening 10 rounds in 2024.

Verstappen began the [2024](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship "2024 Formula One World Championship") season with his fifth career grand slam at the [Bahrain Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2024 Bahrain Grand Prix") [^258] and followed this with another pole and victory at the [Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix "2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix"), his 100th Formula One podium.[^259] He took pole again at the [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Australian_Grand_Prix "2024 Australian Grand Prix") but retired on lap 4, his first retirement since the [2022 edition of the race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_Grand_Prix "2022 Australian Grand Prix"), with a brake fire, ending his nine-race winning streak and 43 race-finishing streak.[^260] This was followed by a pole and win at the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2024 Japanese Grand Prix").[^261] He won the sprint at the [Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2024 Chinese Grand Prix") after starting fourth,[^262] then claimed pole and victory in the race.[^263] He took another sprint win at the [Miami Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Miami_Grand_Prix "2024 Miami Grand Prix") [^264] and started on pole position, but lost the lead to Lando Norris during the pit stops and was unable to reclaim the place, finishing the race second.[^265] He matched [Ayrton Senna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna "Ayrton Senna") 's record of eight consecutive poles at the [Emilia Romagna Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix "2024 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix") [^266] and converted this into his fifth victory of the season. His pole streak ended at the [Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2024 Monaco Grand Prix") where he qualified and finished sixth; Verstappen commented that his [RB20](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB20 "Red Bull RB20") was losing time to its rivals in low-speed corners.[^267]

Verstappen and George Russell set identical lap times in qualifying at the [Canadian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2024 Canadian Grand Prix"), but Russell started on pole position as he had set the lap time first.[^268] Both drivers were overtaken by Norris, but Verstappen later passed Russell then gained the lead from Norris during the pit stops to claim his 60th race win.[^269] He qualified second behind Norris at the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2024 Spanish Grand Prix") but passed him at the start and then overtook Russell to win for the seventh time in 2024.[^270] Verstappen won the sprint from pole at the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2024 Austrian Grand Prix") [^271] and then qualified fastest for the main race.[^272] He led most of the race but was challenged by Norris in the closing laps before the two drivers collided; Verstappen was handed a time penalty for causing the collision and finished the race fifth.[^273] He later commented that the crash did not affect his close friendship with Norris.[^274] He qualified fourth at the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_British_Grand_Prix "2024 British Grand Prix") and passed Norris in the closing laps to finish second behind Lewis Hamilton.[^275] He started third at the [Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2024 Hungarian Grand Prix") but collided with Hamilton and went on to finish fifth. He criticised his team's race strategy and suggested that the RB20 was now behind the race-winning [McLaren MCL38](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL38 "McLaren MCL38") on pace.[^276] Verstappen qualified fastest at the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2024 Belgian Grand Prix") but started outside the top ten due to an engine component penalty.[^277] He recovered positions and was classified fourth in the race,[^278] extending his lead in the championship to 78 points over Norris going into the summer break.[^279]

Verstappen led 17 laps and finished second to rival Norris at the [Dutch Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Dutch_Grand_Prix "2024 Dutch Grand Prix").

At his home race, the [Dutch Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Dutch_Grand_Prix "2024 Dutch Grand Prix"), Verstappen qualified second behind Norris and gained the lead at the first corner, but was later overtaken by Norris and finished second.[^280] He qualified and finished outside the top four at both the [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Italian_Grand_Prix "2024 Italian Grand Prix") and [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix") Grands Prix,[^281] after which Red Bull lost the lead of the Constructors' Championship to McLaren.[^282] He then finished second to Norris at the [Singapore Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2024 Singapore Grand Prix"), reducing his championship advantage to 52 points.[^283] Verstappen described his car as "fucked" at the official press conference in Singapore, for which he received a punishment from the FIA to "accomplish some work of public interest".[^284] He responded by hosting an impromptu media session outside the press conference room in protest,[^285] and later suggested that the decision could push him to leave the sport.[^286] He won the sprint at the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix "2024 United States Grand Prix") and was classified third in the race ahead of Norris, who was penalised for overtaking Verstappen off-track.[^287] This extended Verstappen's championship lead for the first time since the Belgian Grand Prix. He started second at the [Mexico City Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix "2024 Mexico City Grand Prix") but received 20 seconds worth of penalties for his driving during a battle for position with Norris, resulting in a sixth-place finish, reducing his championship lead to 47 points.[^288]

> I mean honestly \[Russell and Norris\] could have got a 10-second penalty and \[Verstappen\] could have won by 30 seconds but it didn't matter. He was so calm about it; he was calculating. Every time he made a passing move. I mean he was exemplary. For me, this was a masterclass of how a racing driver reaches the pinnacle of his career and becomes a four-time World Champion.

— [Eddie Jordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jordan "Eddie Jordan"), speaking about Verstappen's victory at the [2024 São Paulo Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix "2024 São Paulo Grand Prix") [^289]

Verstappen was classified fourth in the [São Paulo Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix "2024 São Paulo Grand Prix") sprint after receiving a [virtual safety car](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_safety_car "Virtual safety car") infringement penalty,[^290] and started the race from 17th following an engine penalty, whilst Norris qualified on pole. He gained seven positions on the opening lap, with further places obtained via several crucial overtakes, as well as surviving the worsening conditions on his intermediate tyres until the [red flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Red_flag "Racing flags") period.[^291] Following this—and his overtake for the lead on Ocon—Verstappen set ten of the eleven fastest laps of the race, with his quickest being 1.045 seconds quicker than any of his rivals;[^292] he won by a 19-second margin, increasing his championship lead to 62 points.[^293] Verstappen was lauded by drivers and critics for his drive;[^294] [^295] [^296] Giles Richards of *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* opined that his performance was "worthy of recognition in the [pantheon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_\(religion\) "Pantheon (religion)") of Formula One's wet-weather drives", describing him as a *[regenmeister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenmeister_\(disambiguation\) "Regenmeister (disambiguation)")* (lit.' rain master ').[^297] By finishing ahead of Norris at the subsequent [Las Vegas Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix "2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix"), Verstappen secured his fourth world title with two races remaining.[^298] Winning eight Grands Prix in all, Andrew Benson of *[BBC Sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport "BBC Sport")* proclaimed it as a "towering achievement from a driver recognised as one of the all-time greats of Formula 1", describing his season as "almost flawless" whilst "not \[having\] the best car for the majority".[^299] Verstappen won the [Qatar Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Qatar_Grand_Prix "2024 Qatar Grand Prix"), leading every lap after having his pole position stripped for driving unnecessarily slowly in qualifying; the incident led to a widely publicised feud with [George Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_\(racing_driver\) "George Russell (racing driver)"). After the season-ending [Abu Dhabi Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix"), Verstappen became the first driver to win a title driving for a third-placed team in the [World Constructors' Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Constructors%27_Championship "World Constructors' Championship") since [Nelson Piquet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Piquet "Nelson Piquet") in [1983](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Formula_One_World_Championship "1983 Formula One World Championship").[^300]

Verstappen received widespread acclaim for his surprise victory at the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2025 Japanese Grand Prix") in [2025](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship "2025 Formula One World Championship"), ahead of both [McLaren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") drivers.

Red Bull trailed [McLaren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") for performance into [2025](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Formula_One_World_Championship "2025 Formula One World Championship"), with Verstappen finishing second at the season-opening [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Australian_Grand_Prix "2025 Australian Grand Prix") after battling [Lando Norris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris "Lando Norris") and [Oscar Piastri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri "Oscar Piastri") for the lead in wet conditions.[^301] He claimed third in the sprint and fourth in the main race in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2025 Chinese Grand Prix") amidst tyre wear and performance struggles with the [RB21](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing_RB21 "Red Bull Racing RB21"), whilst new teammate [Liam Lawson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson "Liam Lawson") finished outside the points; Verstappen claimed Red Bull had also dropped behind [Ferrari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari "Scuderia Ferrari") and [Mercedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"), as Lawson was replaced by [Yuki Tsunoda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda "Yuki Tsunoda").[^302] [^303] He received widespread acclaim for his surprise pole position at the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2025 Japanese Grand Prix"),[^304] before holding off both McLaren drivers to claim his first victory of the year;[^305] Andrew Benson of *[BBC Sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport "BBC Sport")* described it as "a weekend of the sort of rare perfection that comes only from drivers of the very highest quality".[^306] He finished sixth in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2025 Bahrain Grand Prix") amidst further performance and [pit stop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop "Pit stop") struggles, prompting Red Bull to hold crisis talks over his future.[^307] He returned to pole in [Saudi Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix "2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix"), where he finished second after receiving a penalty for a first-corner incident with Piastri.[^308] Verstappen finished fourth in the [Miami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Miami_Grand_Prix "2025 Miami Grand Prix") sprint, demoted to seventeenth following a penalty for an unsafe pit release;[^309] he took pole for the main race, ultimately finishing fourth.[^310] He won the [Emilia Romagna Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix "2025 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix") after a first-lap overtake on Piastri into *[Variante Tamburello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola_Circuit#Tamburello "Imola Circuit")*, which was widely hailed as one of his greatest.[^311] After qualifying seventh for the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2025 Austrian Grand Prix"), Verstappen endured his first retirement of the season after being hit and spun by [Andrea Kimi Antonelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli "Andrea Kimi Antonelli") on the first lap;[^312] 61 points behind championship leader Piastri, Verstappen admitted his fifth title challenge was "case closed".[^313]

Verstappen on a qualifying lap at the [2018 Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2018 Chinese Grand Prix")

Following Verstappen's maiden pole position at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix, former Formula One World Champion Nico Rosberg described him as the fastest driver in Formula One. Rosberg elucidated that Verstappen did not have the fastest car during the qualifying session in Hungary, emphasising that it was Verstappen's raw speed that allowed him to secure pole position: "Mercedes still had the fastest car, and it's just Verstappen with his driving that put it up there in pole." [^314]

In 2019, former Formula One World Champion [Jenson Button](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button "Jenson Button") stated that he believes Verstappen is the fastest Formula One driver ever: "I think he is the fastest driver that has ever driven an F1 car. I really do, I think he is unbelievably fast." [^315] Journalist Scott Mitchell from *The Race* commented: "When everything comes together, Verstappen is the quickest driver in F1 over one lap, but the odd mistake and scruffy session must be eliminated." [^316] Helmut Marko, the advisor to the [Red Bull GmbH](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_GmbH "Red Bull GmbH") Formula One teams, stated that Verstappen is the fastest driver Red Bull have ever had.[^317] [^318]

In 2021, three-time Formula One World Champion [Jackie Stewart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Stewart "Jackie Stewart") claimed that Verstappen is the fastest driver in Formula One, but he also added that Verstappen is still in the "puppy stage" of his career.[^319] [Peter Windsor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Windsor "Peter Windsor"), an experienced Formula One journalist, expressed Verstappen's ability to change direction "quicker than anybody else" through the high-speed section Maggots and Becketts: Silverstone's fastest sequence of corners. Windsor stressed that Verstappen's lightning-quick change of direction is a result of the innate feel he has for creating the "perfect platform" to achieve what he wants with the car during a lap. He is intrinsically able to create, for "a trillionth of a second", a minuscule "flat area" between the left and the right of a change of direction ahead of him, in order to attain a stable balance with the car before applying the next steering and throttle input.[^320] [Scuderia AlphaTauri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_AlphaTauri "Scuderia AlphaTauri") 's team principal, [Franz Tost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Tost "Franz Tost"), declared Verstappen to be the fastest driver in Formula One; following the Dutchman's "really deserved" maiden title triumph in 2021.[^321] After winning the [2024](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship "2024 Formula One World Championship") World Drivers' Championship in the third-placed [RB20](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB20 "Red Bull RB20"), James Elson of *[Motor Sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Sport_\(magazine\) "Motor Sport (magazine)")* stated "if there was any doubt beforehand, 2024 proved that Max Verstappen is F1’s best driver", adding that "not only the fastest, capable of creating one-lap magic, he knows how to produce all it takes to win in the race too".[^322]

Verstappen received widespread acclaim for his surprise pole lap at the [2025 Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2025 Japanese Grand Prix"),[^304] with Andrew Benson of *[BBC Sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport "BBC Sport")* commenting that "many F1 observers regarded \[Verstappen's qualifying lap\] as one of the greatest of all time".[^323]

Verstappen *(right)* was teammates with [Daniel Ricciardo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo "Daniel Ricciardo") *(left)* from [2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Formula_One_World_Championship "2016 Formula One World Championship") to [2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship "2018 Formula One World Championship"), pictured at the [2016 Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2016 Malaysian Grand Prix").

Former Formula One driver [Eddie Irvine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Irvine "Eddie Irvine") praised Verstappen, stating that he is "by far the most dominant team leader on the grid." Irvine highlighted that Verstappen "has had many different second drivers in the team and none of them have got close to him." [^324] During the 2020 season, Jenson Button stated that he does not "think there's been a driver that's annihilated their teammates like he \[Verstappen\] has in a very long time." [^325] Motorsport columnist and former Formula One driver [Jolyon Palmer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolyon_Palmer "Jolyon Palmer"), commented that Verstappen's maiden World Championship triumph could usher in a "new era of dominance" in the sport. Palmer wrote:

> \[Verstappen's\] qualifying pace is frightening and has been the basis for this title-charging campaign. He's had the most pole positions of anyone with 10 – almost half of the races, and it would have been half had he completed his mesmeric Jeddah lap, which ended up being possibly Max's biggest error in a near-perfect season. For a driver who has demolished three successive team mates in three years and made only a handful of small mistakes in that time, you question what scope their \[*[sic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")*\] even is for improvement – but if he can take his game onto another level from here, we could be about to see the start of a new era of dominance.[^326]

Journalist Scott Mitchell expounded the reason why the Dutchman's teammates have fallen short "even with the data". Mitchell wrote: "Verstappen drives mainly on intuition, and that comes from years of training and preparation. He has a database in his head which he can use immediately. Even with data, Gasly and Albon could see where he was faster, but they could never grasp how he was faster there. That's because what makes Verstappen so good is mainly unconscious." According to Mitchell, those years of training and driving on his intuition has made it impossible for other drivers to measure up to Verstappen.[^327]

Verstappen *(right)* was teammates with [Sergio Pérez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez "Sergio Pérez") *(left)* from 2021 to 2024, pictured at the [2024 Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2024 Chinese Grand Prix").

Helmut Marko asserted that Verstappen's progress has moved him clear of his former Formula 1 team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, in both qualifying and race trim. "There is specific data," Marko told *Autosport*, "In qualifying the gap to Ricciardo is greater. The strange thing is Max sometimes slides more, but still manages to keep the tyres alive." Verstappen previously mentioned that he was three or four-tenths faster on average than "very fast qualifier" Daniel Ricciardo.[^328] Marko concluded that then 20-year-old Verstappen "clearly moved away" from Ricciardo since the "second half of the 2018 season." [^329]

### Natural talent

Following his maiden Formula One win, at the [2016 Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2016 Spanish Grand Prix"), three-time World Drivers' Champion [Niki Lauda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Lauda "Niki Lauda") described Verstappen as the "talent of the century." [^330] Red Bull team principal Christian Horner stated that Verstappen is the best driver Red Bull have ever seen: "I have no doubt \[Verstappen is\] the best we have seen on one of our cars, in terms of outright raw ability and commitment. He's the best driver we've seen." [^331]

[Gerhard Berger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Berger "Gerhard Berger") echoed [2009](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Formula_One_World_Championship "2009 Formula One World Championship") World Drivers' Champion [Jenson Button](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button "Jenson Button") 's comments, anointing Max Verstappen as the Formula One driver of this era with the most raw talent. Speaking to *Sport1*, Berger ventured: "When it comes to raw talent, Max Verstappen is the most talented of all. But it's not just about raw talent, it's about the whole package. That means it's not just about setting the fastest laps but also to win a race. And not just \[about\] one race but many and eventually a championship, and championships." [^332]

Two-time World Drivers' Champion [Fernando Alonso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso "Fernando Alonso") commented that Verstappen is the standout driver in Formula One, declaring him to be "one step ahead" of everyone. Alonso noted that Verstappen deserved to win the [2021 Formula One World Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship "2021 Formula One World Championship"), ahead of the title decider that saw Verstappen and [Lewis Hamilton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton "Lewis Hamilton") enter level on points: "Mercedes lately have been more performing and they've won a couple of races now, but Max is driving—in my opinion—one step ahead of all of us. We saw the \[qualifying\] lap in Jeddah, until he touched the wall at the last corner, that lap was coming from Max, not the Red Bull." [^333] [Karun Chandhok](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karun_Chandhok "Karun Chandhok") likened Verstappen's ruthless and uncompromising attitude in race combat to seven-time World Drivers' Champion [Michael Schumacher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher "Michael Schumacher").[^334]

### Racecraft

Following Verstappen being given a warning for his driving conduct at the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix, the 18-year-old received the backing of then three-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who commented: "firstly, give the guy a break, he is 18 years old. What the frickin' heck were any of us doing at 18?" [^335]

Despite earning high praise and acclaim from Formula One drivers and experts in and out of the sport, Verstappen faced criticism in the wake of the penalties he incurred during the [2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix "2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix"). Following this race, former Formula One driver [Martin Brundle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Brundle "Martin Brundle") wrote: "Such is \[his\] car control and cunning, he's sometimes able to pull off the audacious moves and leave a margin of doubt as to whether it's hard racing or simply a professional foul outside of the regulations and it's those moments which are generating the confusion, controversies and inconsistencies. [Ayrton Senna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna "Ayrton Senna") and Michael Schumacher had their faults too, and I was on the receiving end from both of them on occasions, but it's a sizeable dent on their immense reputations, not a positive." [^336] Following an impressive first half of the 2022 season, journalist [David Tremayne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tremayne "David Tremayne") claimed Verstappen had elevated himself to a new higher level compared to his 2021 title winning season, suggesting Verstappen's first title had made him more relaxed and "chirpy".[^337]

Following the [2024 Mexico City Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Mexico_City_Grand_Prix "2024 Mexico City Grand Prix"), Verstappen received widespread condemnation from fans and media for incidents involving title rival [Lando Norris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris "Lando Norris"), for which he received 20 seconds worth of time penalties.[^338] Many commentators and former drivers likened his tactics and 'win-at-all-costs' attitude to those of Senna and Schumacher,[^339] [^340] whilst [1996](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Formula_One_World_Championship "1996 Formula One World Championship") World Drivers' Champion [Damon Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Hill "Damon Hill") characterised them as reminiscent of *[Wacky Races](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Races "Wacky Races")* antagonist [Dick Dastardly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Dastardly "Dick Dastardly").[^341] Before the following race in [São Paulo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix "2024 São Paulo Grand Prix"), Verstappen criticised the alleged British bias in the media, stating "I have the wrong passport".[^342] Upon his victory from 17th on the grid in the rain-affected race, he stated in the post-race press conference "I appreciate all of you being here, but I don't see any British press. Do they have to run to the airport, or \[do they not\] know where the press conference is?" [^343]

### Fan support

The Verstappen grandstand at the [2021 Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2021 Austrian Grand Prix")

Verstappen has accumulated a significant fanbase from around the world, particularly from his home country of the Netherlands. The frequent association of Verstappen with the colour [orange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_\(colour\) "Orange (colour)") —the [national colour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_colour "National colour") of the Netherlands—has led to his fanbase being referred to as the *Orange Army*.[^344] [^345]

Several races across Europe have dedicated Verstappen [grandstands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandstand "Grandstand") to accommodate thousands of travelling Dutch fans, boosting ticket sales at Grands Prix such as in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix "Belgian Grand Prix"), [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix "Austrian Grand Prix") and [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix "Hungarian Grand Prix").[^346] A Verstappen grandstand featured at the inaugural [Las Vegas Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix "Las Vegas Grand Prix") in [2023](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix "2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix").[^347]

During the [2021 Dutch Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Dutch_Grand_Prix "2021 Dutch Grand Prix"), the managing director of [Honda in Formula One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One "Honda in Formula One"), [Masashi Yamamoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masashi_Yamamoto_\(motorsport\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Masashi Yamamoto (motorsport) (page does not exist)"), praised Verstappen's support, stating that "in the six years I've been involved with Honda F1, I've never seen such a great turnout as at the Dutch Grand Prix. It was like being in a football stadium." [^348]

In October 2021, Verstappen was voted the most popular Formula One driver in an official worldwide survey conducted by [Nielsen Media Research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research "Nielsen Media Research") and [Motorsport Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport_Network "Motorsport Network"), earning 14.4% of the vote with particular success in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan").[^349] [^350]

The fan-made song " [Super Max!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Max! "Super Max!")", performed by the [Pitstop Boys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pitstop_Boys&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pitstop Boys (page does not exist)") in 2016, went viral after his victory at the [2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix"), topping the [Spotify](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify "Spotify") *Viral 50* chart in the Netherlands and reaching number two in the United Kingdom.[^351] Another fan-made [EDM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music "Electronic dance music") track "33 Max Verstappen", was released in 2023, eventually going viral on social media due to [internet memes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme "Internet meme") referencing the hook: "tu tu tu du, Max Verstappen".[^352] [^353]

### Sportscar racing

The [Acura ARX-06](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acura_ARX-06 "Acura ARX-06") (pictured in 2023) tested by Verstappen with [Honda Racing Corporation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Racing_Corporation "Honda Racing Corporation") in November 2024.

Verstappen tested the [Honda NSX-GT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_NSX_\(second_generation\)#Super_GT "Honda NSX (second generation)") —a [GT500](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_GT#GT500 "Super GT") class [Super GT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_GT "Super GT") car—during the 2022 [Honda Racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Racing_Corporation "Honda Racing Corporation") *Thanks Day* event at [Motegi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_Resort_Motegi "Mobility Resort Motegi").[^354] After winning the event's [kart race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing "Kart racing") alongside [Marc Márquez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_M%C3%A1rquez "Marc Márquez"), Honda awarded Verstappen—the first [Honda-powered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One "Honda in Formula One") World Drivers' Champion since [1991](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Formula_One_World_Championship "1991 Formula One World Championship") —with an [NSX Type S](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_NSX_\(second_generation\)#NSX_Type_S_\(2022\) "Honda NSX (second generation)").[^355]

In January 2024, Verstappen drove the [Ferrari 296 GT3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_296_GT3 "Ferrari 296 GT3") at the [Portimão](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algarve_International_Circuit "Algarve International Circuit"), as part of a two-day test with [Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Masters "Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters") team [Emil Frey Racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Frey_Racing "Emil Frey Racing") alongside [Thierry Vermeulen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Vermeulen "Thierry Vermeulen"),[^356] who competed under the *Verstappen.com Racing* banner in [2023](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Masters "2023 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters").[^357] Team principal Lorenz Frey-Hilti stated "there were also other [GT3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_GT3 "Group GT3") cars that day, but I can only say that Verstappen was driving on a different level than the rest. There are good drivers who cannot shine in a GT3 car due to a lack of experience, but Max is different. If something has four wheels, then \[he's fast in it\]", adding that he was "world-class".[^358] In May 2025, he entered testing for the third round of the [2025 Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%C3%BCrburgring_Langstrecken-Serie "2025 Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie") in the 296 under the [pseudonym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym "Pseudonym") "Franz Hermann", where he claimed to set an unofficial [GT3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_GT3 "Group GT3") lap record, reportedly in an attempt to obtain a license to compete on the *[Nordschleife](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordschleife "Nordschleife")*.[^359] [^360] He received an [FIA Platinum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Platinum "FIA Platinum") license later that month, allowing him to compete in top-level [endurance racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_racing_\(motorsport\) "Endurance racing (motorsport)").[^361]

On 19 November 2024, Verstappen drove a [prototype](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_prototype "Sports prototype") for the first time, testing the [Acura ARX-06](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acura_ARX-06 "Acura ARX-06") with [Honda Racing Corporation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Racing_Corporation "Honda Racing Corporation") at [Las Vegas Motor Speedway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway "Las Vegas Motor Speedway"), ahead of the [Las Vegas Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Las_Vegas_Grand_Prix "2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix").[^362] Verstappen expressed his desire to compete in the [24 Hours of Daytona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Daytona "24 Hours of Daytona") and [Le Mans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans "24 Hours of Le Mans") after the test, stating that "it's just about finding the time".[^363]

### Sim racing
