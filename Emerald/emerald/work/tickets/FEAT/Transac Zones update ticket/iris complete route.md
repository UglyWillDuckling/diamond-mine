#subticket

- [ ] implemente new route
- [ ]
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] check if we need to add the route the **another** **repo**
___
## result

path:
name: 
test path: 
changes: 

## method / approach

- we should create a completely new endpoint used only by [[work/docs/backyard/backyard|backyard]].

- The endpoint should return the complete results containing all information for a specific [[iris zone]] %% this should be added somewhere and defined %%.

- The new route should match the old one in terms of parameters and should **share** most of the implementation.

- the new route should also be tested


### how to test

### pitfalls


## work

- [ ] create the `total pages` route
- [ ]  need to check **bool** params: `get_total_pages` and `is_manual_edit`
- [ ] ..

- new **total pages r**oute works
- no tests for new routes

I'm not sure how to test 🧪 the new routes 📡.

There's allot of shared functionality so it's hard to decide what and how to test.
