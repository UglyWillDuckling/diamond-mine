**Awesome Books - Make An Impact with Every Book**

Awesome Books was born from a love for books: to not see books thrown away when they can still be read and their stories shared. As a global retailer, we offer millions of books, both [used books](https://www.awesomebooks.com/used-books) and [new books](https://www.awesomebooks.com/books/bestsellers), at great prices. You can choose to buy a new book or a [second-hand book](https://www.awesomebooks.com/used-books) for even better value. Our online bookshop has a wide selection of books from different genres including popular categories such as , , , , , and so many more, so you can easily find your next favourite read. We believe in the power of books to offer an escape, teach us new things, and inspire our imagination. When you buy a book from us, we donate a book to someone in need via our [You Buy, We Give Campaign](https://www.awesomebooks.com/#). We believe it is [our purpose](https://www.awesomebooks.com/our-purpose) and mission to help improve literacy around the world, so join us in our love for books and help spread the joy of reading to others.
