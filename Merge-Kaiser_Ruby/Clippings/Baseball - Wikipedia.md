**Baseball** is a [bat-and-ball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games "Bat-and-ball games") [sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport "Sport") played between two [teams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport "Team sport") of nine players each, taking turns [batting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_\(baseball\) "Batting (baseball)") and [fielding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_\(baseball\) "Fielding (baseball)"). The game occurs over the course of several [plays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_\(baseball\) "Pitch (baseball)"), with each play beginning when a player on the [fielding team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_team_\(baseball\) "Fielding team (baseball)"), called the [pitcher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher "Pitcher"), throws a [ball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_\(ball\) "Baseball (ball)") that a player on the [batting team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_team_\(baseball\) "Batting team (baseball)"), called the [batter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batter_\(baseball\) "Batter (baseball)"), tries to hit with a [bat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat "Baseball bat"). The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the [bases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_\(baseball\) "Base (baseball)"), having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called " [runs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_\(baseball\) "Run (baseball)") ". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming [runners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running "Base running"), and to prevent runners [advancing around the bases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running "Base running").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

The initial objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [safely](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_\(baseball\) "Safe (baseball)"); this occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base [before](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_play "Force play") an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball [out of the batter's reach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls "Base on balls"). Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called " [out](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_\(baseball\) "Out (baseball)") " can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by using the ball to get batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three [pitches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_\(baseball\) "Pitch (baseball)") which result in [strikes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_\(baseball\) "Strike (baseball)"), while fielders can get the batter out by [catching](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_\(baseball\) "Catch (baseball)") a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by [tagging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_out "Tag out") them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.

The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [inning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning "Inning"). A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, [extra innings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings "Extra innings") are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature [pace-of-play](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_of_play "Pace of play") regulations such as a [pitch clock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_clock "Pitch clock") to shorten game time.

Baseball [evolved from older bat-and-ball games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_baseball "Origins of baseball") already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [where the modern version developed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_baseball_in_the_United_States "History of baseball in the United States"). Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of [escapism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism "Escapism") during troubled points in American history such as the [American Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") and the [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"), have led the sport to receive the moniker of "America's Pastime"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the [national sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sport "National sport") of the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_in_the_United_States "Baseball in the United States"), though in modern times is considered [less popular than other sports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_the_United_States#Most_popular_sports_in_the_United_States "Sports in the United States"), such as [American football](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football"). In addition to [North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"), baseball spread throughout the rest of the Americas and the Asiaâ€“Pacific in the 19th and 20th centuries,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and is now considered the most popular sport in parts of [Central](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America") and [South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America"), the [Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean"), and [East Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia "East Asia"), particularly in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_in_Japan "Baseball in Japan"), [South Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_in_South_Korea "Baseball in South Korea"), and [Taiwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_Taiwan#Baseball "Sports in Taiwan").

In [Major League Baseball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball "Major League Baseball") (MLB), the highest level of [professional baseball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_baseball "Professional baseball") in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the [National League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_\(baseball\) "National League (baseball)") (NL) and [American League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League "American League") (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [playoffs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason "Major League Baseball postseason") that culminate in the [World Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series "World Series"). The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [Central](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_League "Central League") and [Pacific Leagues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_League "Pacific League") and in Cuba between the [West League and East League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_National_Series "Cuban National Series"). The [World Baseball Classic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Baseball_Classic "World Baseball Classic"), organized by the [World Baseball Softball Confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Baseball_Softball_Confederation "World Baseball Softball Confederation"), is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. Baseball was played [at the Olympic Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_at_the_Summer_Olympics "Baseball at the Summer Olympics") from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated on a one-off basis in 2020.
