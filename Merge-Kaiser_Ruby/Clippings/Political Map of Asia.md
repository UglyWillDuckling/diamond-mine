## About Asia

  
![[~/×/c8322a0d03935bb4cbc71e564d3d3ebf_MD5.jpg]]The map shows the bulk of Asia without the [Middle East](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/small_middle_east_map.htm). Asia is the largest of the world's continents, it constitutes nearly one-third of [Earth](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/earth.htm) 's landmass and is lying entirely north of the equator, except for some Southeast Asian islands. Asia occupies the better part of Eurasia, the largest single landmass on the planet. For good measure, the Malay Archipelago was added to Asia, because it happens to be in the region. Asia borders [Europe](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/europe.htm) (which is part of the same landmass) in the west, along the Ural Mountains, and across the Caspian Sea. The continent is bounded by the Arctic Ocean in the north, the Pacific Ocean in the east, and the Indian Ocean in the south.  
  
For the average Westerner point of view, Asia represents foremost the spices of India, Sushi and Kobe beef from Japan, silk and fine china from China. Zen, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism are the major religions and philosophies associated with Asia, even though Indonesia is currently the most populous country with a Muslim majority population.
