Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS  enable attackers to inject client-side scripts **into web pages** viewed by other users. 
A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.
