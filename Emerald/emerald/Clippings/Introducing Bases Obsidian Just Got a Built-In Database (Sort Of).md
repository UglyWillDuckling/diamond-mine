So, Obsidian just dropped something pretty awesome. It’s called **Bases**, and if you’ve ever wished your vault could feel a *little* more like Notion or Airtable (but without actually leaving Markdown), you’re gonna love this.

Let’s break it down!

### What Even Is Bases?

Think of Bases like a super chill database view. It lets you take a set of notes and treat them like rows in a table. Each row? That’s a note. Each column? That’s a property—like a tag, date, status, whatever you’ve got going on in your frontmatter.

No plugins to install. It’s now a **core plugin**, which means it’s built right in. Just go to your settings and flip the switch.

One thing to note though— **Bases is only available in version 1.9.0 and up**. And right now, that version is in **early access**. If you’ve got a Catalyst license (which helps support Obsidian’s development), you can grab early builds and try it out today.

Pretty cool perk, right?

### How To Turn It On (Takes 10 Seconds)

1. Go to **Settings → Core Plugins**.
2. Find **Bases** and hit “Enable”.
3. (Bonus step: enable **Properties** too, if you haven’t already. They’re besties.)

Done.

Now, right-click a folder and hit **“New Base”**. Boom. Instant table.

### Your First Base in Action

Let’s say you’ve got a folder full of book notes. With Bases, you can now see them in a neat table. Add columns for author, genre, read status, rating—you name it.

Click any cell on the **name** column to view the note. Sort, filter, or rearrange columns however you like. Change column type to text, list, number, checkbox, date or datetime.

No code. No weird syntax. Just vibes.

### Filters, Sorting & Custom Views

Need to see only your 5-star books? Easy. Want to sort your tasks by due date? Done.

You can:

- Filter notes by any property
- Sort by columns (ascending or descending)
- Hide stuff you don’t want to see

It’s like spreadsheet-meets-notes. Kinda wild, right?

### Real-Life Ways To Use It

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

- ✅ Project planner (status, priority, deadlines)
- 📚 Reading list tracker
- 🧠 Evergreen notes dashboard
- 💼 Contact or client list
- 🧪 Lab journal or research tracker

Got another idea? Try it!

### How’s It Different From Dataview?

Ah yes, the question everyone’s thinking.

**Dataview** is amazing. But it’s more for those of us who are cool writing queries in pseudo-code.

**Bases** is for those times when you just want to *see* your stuff. No code. Just click and scroll. It’s simpler and more visual.

They’re not enemies—they’re like two tools in the same box.

### And How Does It Compare With DB Folder?

Glad you asked. Right now, **DB Folder** is definitely more powerful. You can build complex views, use formulas, rollups, even set up relationships between notes. It’s like Notion-on-steroids for Obsidian.

But here’s the kicker— **Bases feels way faster and smoother.**

Honestly? I’ve already swapped DB Folder out of my workflow. Bases is just that good out of the gate. And I’ve got a feeling the Obsidian team will be adding more advanced features soon. Maybe even the same ones we love from DB Folder—and more.

So if you’re torn, try both. But keep your eye on Bases. It’s only getting started.

### Final Thoughts

Bases is a low-key game changer. It brings just enough structure to make Obsidian more powerful—without losing that Markdown freedom we all love.

Whether you’re planning projects or tracking books or just trying to make sense of your folders— **this plugin makes it easier.**

Give it a try this week. It might become your new favorite view.
