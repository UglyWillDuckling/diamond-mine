***The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity*** is a 1992 [self-help](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help "Self-help") book by American author [Julia Cameron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Cameron "Julia Cameron"). The book was written to help people with [artistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist#The_present_day_concept_of_an_.27artist.27 "Artist") [creative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity "Creativity") [recovery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_model#Elements_of_recovery "Recovery model"), which teaches techniques and exercises to assist people in gaining self-confidence in harnessing their creative talents and skills. Correlation and emphasis is used by the author to show a connection between artistic creativity and a spiritual connection with [God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God").[^way-1][^classic-2][^creator-3][^returning-4]

The ideas in creative [personal development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development "Personal development") outlined in the book, which were felt to be new at the time of the publication,[^creativity-5] are said to have become a phenomenon and spawned into many meetups and [support groups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group "Support group") throughout the world. The group meetings are based on a 12-week creativity course designed for people to work through and gain [artistic inspiration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_inspiration "Artistic inspiration"), as outlined in the book. The program is focused on supporting relationships in removing artistic blocks and fostering confidence.[^way-1][^success-6]

Starting as a collection of tips and hints from different artists and authors, *The Artist's Way* was collected into a single book and [self-published](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing "Self-publishing") by [Julia Cameron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Cameron "Julia Cameron") for maximizing the creativity and productivity of artists.[^selfpublish-7]

The book was originally titled ***Healing the Artist Within***, and was turned down by the [William Morris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris_Endeavor "William Morris Endeavor") literary agency, before being self-published. Cameron typed the book herself and sold Xeroxed copies in a local bookstore.[^green-8] After the book began to sell widely, the title was then changed, when the book was published by Jeremy Tarcher (now part of [Penguin Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Group "Penguin Group")) in 1992.[^creativity-5] The first printing was about 9,000 copies.[^green-8] The book went on to reach the *Top 10 best seller list*[^self-help-9] and onto the list of the *Top 100 Best Self-Help Books of All Time*.[^top-10] The book was eventually put into the *Self-Publishing Hall of Fame* after selling millions of copies worldwide.[^selfpublish-7]

Cameron maintains throughout the book that creative inspiration is from and of a divine origin and influence, that artists seeking to enable creativity need to understand and believe in.[^creator-3] In an interview, she states that "God is an artist. So are we. And we can cooperate with each other." And that our "creative dreams and longings do come from a divine source, not from the human ego".[^cameron-11]
