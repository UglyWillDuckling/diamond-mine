In [[Vim]], you can jump to the last insert position by using the following
commands:

1.  ''  (two single quotes): This will take you to the last insert position in
the current file.
2.  ''  (two backticks): This will take you to the last insert position in any
file.

These commands are called "mark" commands, and they allow you to quickly
navigate to specific locations in your file.

Alternatively, you can also use the  gi  command to jump to the last insert
position and enter insert mode. This is useful if you want to continue editing
from where you left off.
