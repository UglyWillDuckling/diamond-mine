**Haenyeo** [^1] ([Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 해녀; lit. sea women) are **female divers in the South Korean province** of [Jeju](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Province "Jeju Province"), whose livelihood consists of harvesting a variety of mollusks, seaweed, and other sea life from the ocean. Known for their independent spirit and determination, *haenyeo* are representative of the semi-matriarchal family structure of Jeju.[^2]<sup><span title="Page / location: 1">: 1 </span></sup>  [^3] [^4]

Traditionally, girls started training as *haenyeo* when they **were 11 years old**. Beginning in shallow water, trainees worked their way up to more challenging depths. After about seven years of training, a girl was considered a "full-fledged" *haenyeo*.[^5] Today, the oldest *haenyeo* are over 80 years old, and **almost 90% are older than 60 years**.[^6] [^7]

*The traditional outfit and tools for haenyeo displayed at a museum in Jeju*

All together, the tools of a *haenyeo* consist of a [wetsuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetsuit "Wetsuit"), [diving mask](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_mask "Diving mask"), [fins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimfin "Swimfin"),[^8] [^9] gloves, chest weights (or freediving weight belts, to assist diving), an L-shaped weeding hoe, and a net attached to a flotation device.[^6] The *haenyeo* stash their catch in these nets until they are done for the day.[^6]

How long the *haenyeo* spend in the water depends on the season. Before wetsuits were available and all they wore were cotton swimsuits, *haenyeo* could stay in the water for only up to an hour at a time during the winter months. After an hour, they got out of the water and sat by the fire for 3–4 hours to dry off. After this break, they would jump back into the water for another hour. During the summer months, however, they stayed in the water for up to 3 hours at a time before a break. **With the introduction of wetsuits, *haenyeo* found they could stay in the water for five to six hours at a time, even during the winter.**[^10] [^11]

With each dive, *haenyeo* plunge up to 20 metres (66 ft) deep and hold their breath typically for 1–3 minutes, practicing a rapid, whistling breathing technique called 'sumbisori'.[^12] [^13] [^10] [^6] 

Their harvests consist of [abalone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone "Abalone"), [conch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch "Conch"), [octopus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus "Octopus"), [sea urchins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin "Sea urchin"), [sea squirt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascidiacea "Ascidiacea"), [brown alga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae "Brown algae"), [top shell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliostoma "Calliostoma"), a variety of [sargassum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargassum "Sargassum"), [oysters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster "Oyster") and [sea slugs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_slug "Sea slug"), etc.[^5] [^10] [^14] [^15] [^16] [^6] The divers must contend with dangers such as [jellyfish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish"), poor weather and sharks.[^6] [^17]

Jeju's diving tradition dates back to 434 AD.[^5]<sup><span title="Page / location: 100">: 100 </span></sup>  Originally, diving was an exclusively male profession, with the exception of women who worked alongside their husbands.[^5]<sup><span title="Page / location: 101">: 101 </span></sup>  The first mention of female divers in literature does not come until the 17th century, when a monograph of Jeju geography describes them as *jamnyeo* (literally "diving women").[^5]<sup><span title="Page / location: 101">: 101 </span></sup>

By the 18th century, female divers, at this point commonly referred to as *haenyeo*, outnumbered male divers.[^18]<sup><span title="Page / location: 1">: 1 </span></sup>  Several possible explanations exist for this shift. For instance, in the 17th century, a significant number of men died at sea due to war or deep-sea fishing accidents, meaning that diving became the work of women.[^2]<sup><span title="Page / location: 1">: 1 </span></sup>  [^19] Another explanation is that women tend to have more [subcutaneous fat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_fat "Subcutaneous fat") and a higher shivering threshold than men, making them better suited to work in cold waters.[^5]<sup><span title="Page / location: 101">: 101 </span></sup>  An 18th century document records that taxes of dried [abalone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone "Abalone") were imposed on ordinary people, forcing many women to dive in cold waters while pregnant.[^19]

As sea diving became a female-dominated industry, many of the *haenyeo* subsequently replaced their husbands as the primary laborer.[^18] [^14] [^20] This trend was especially prominent after the [Japanese colonized Korea in 1910](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule "Korea under Japanese rule") and diving became much more lucrative.[^15] Up until this point, much of what the *haenyeo* harvested was given to the [Joseon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon "Joseon") government as tribute.[^15] When the Japanese took over, however, they abolished this tradition, allowing *haenyeo* to sell their catch at market and make a profit.[^15] Additionally, Japanese and Korean merchants hired *haenyeo* to work for them in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") and on the Korean mainland as wage-laborers, increasing their financial situations greatly. On Yeonpyeong-ri, an island near [Incheon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon "Incheon") where many *haenyeo* worked, their wages, on average, constituted 40 to 48 percent of a typical family's total income.[^15] The prominent place of *haenyeo* in Jeju's economy and in their individual family units continued long after Japanese colonization. In the early 1960s, for example, *haenyeo* harvests accounted for 60% of Jeju's fisheries revenue, and 40% of *haenyeo* husbands remained unemployed.[^5] [^14]

Like many other historical cultural practices, the sea-diving industry has fallen victim to industrialisation. Beginning in the 1960s, the Korean government sought ways to jumpstart the country's economy in every province. Because Jeju was not a practical place to build factories, the Korean government decided to turn it into an exporter of [mandarin oranges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_orange "Mandarin orange"). By 1969, a majority of rural workers had joined this new industry. Additionally, about 2% of all land in Jeju was dedicated to farming mandarin oranges. In the 1970s, the government launched another program to bolster Jeju's [tourism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism "Tourism") industry. By 1978, tourism had surpassed agriculture as the island's largest industry.[^15]

All of this change had a significant impact on *haenyeo* numbers. Given less-strenuous alternatives, many women abandoned the sea-diving industry.[^15] In the five years between 1965 and 1970, numbers dropped from 23,081 to 14,143.[^15] In addition, education opportunities and attractive positions in emerging industries are considered to have deterred younger girls from becoming *haenyeo*.[^15] [^16]<sup><span title="Page / location: 2350">: 2350 </span></sup>  In 1970, 31% of *haenyeo* were 30 years old or younger, 55% were between 30 and 49 years old and only 14% were 50 or older. As of 2014, however, 98% of *haenyeo* were over the age of 50.[^18]<sup><span title="Page / location: 2">: 2 </span></sup> 

As the sea water temperature around the island of Jeju has gone up, the amount of seaweed, food for the abalone, has decreased and there have been outbreaks of algae and jelly fish, fears for the sustainability of marine resources have also been a factor in the decline of numbers of sea-divers.[^21]

Because so many families relied on the *haenyeo* for the majority of their income, a semi-matriarchal society developed on Jeju with the *haenyeo* at the head of the household.[^10] [^15] On the tiny islets off the coast of Jeju, such as Mara Island, where sea-diving was the sole source of income, this reversal of traditional gender roles was fully realized; men would look after the children and go shopping while the women would bring in money for the family.[^10] Other manifestations of Jeju's unique society include men paying a dowry to the family of the bride (a reversal of the custom on the Korean mainland) and families celebrating the birth of girls over the birth of boys.[^19] [^22]

While certain elements of a matriarchal [society surfaced in Jeju](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_people "Jeju people"), they were not enough to completely overcome the predominance of [Confucianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism"). As a result, beyond the domestic sphere, little else about Jeju society was different from what existed on the Korean mainland. For example, men filled all political leadership roles and were the only ones who could perform [ancestor-worship ceremonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesa "Jesa") and inherit property and the familial line. Furthermore, during the era of colonial rule, *haenyeo* remained peasants, never moving up the chain to become small-business owners or managers of seafood manufacturing plants.[^15] Even in the home, most *haenyeo* remained the primary caregiver and handled at least half of the domestic chores.[^5]<sup><span title="Page / location: 107">: 107 </span></sup> 

Today, *haenyeo* are celebrated as one of Jeju's most-valued treasures. The Korean government shows its appreciation for the unique contributions of the *haenyeo* to Jeju's culture by subsidizing their gear and granting them exclusive rights to sell fresh seafood.[^10] [^14] Furthermore, in March 2014, the government requested the [UNESCO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") to add *haenyeo* to its [Intangible Cultural Heritage list](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists").[^19] *Haenyeo* were inscribed in [UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists") in 2016.[^13] Directed by [Koh Heeyoung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh_Heeyoung "Koh Heeyoung") *Breathing Underwater* was a documentary that was produced as part of wider efforts to raise awareness of, and UNESCO listing for the culture of haenyo.[^23] [^24]
