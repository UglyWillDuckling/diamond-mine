## Career

Cuarón at the Guadalajara International Film Festival in 1998.

Cuarón began working on television in [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several film productions including *[La Gran Fiesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Gran_Fiesta "La Gran Fiesta")* (1985), *[Gaby: A True Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaby:_A_True_Story "Gaby: A True Story")* (1987) and *[Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romero_\(film\) "Romero (film)")* (1989). In 1991 he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment, *[Sólo con tu pareja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B3lo_con_tu_pareja "Sólo con tu pareja")*, a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [Daniel Giménez Cacho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gim%C3%A9nez_Cacho "Daniel Giménez Cacho")) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS "AIDS"). In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán.[^8] The film, which also starred cabaret singer [Astrid Hadad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Hadad "Astrid Hadad") and model/actress [Claudia Ramírez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Ram%C3%ADrez "Claudia Ramírez") (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993) was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director [Sydney Pollack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Pollack "Sydney Pollack") hired Cuarón to direct an episode of *[Fallen Angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_Angels_\(American_TV_series\) "Fallen Angels (American TV series)")*, a series of [neo-noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-noir "Neo-noir") stories produced for the [Showtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_\(TV_network\) "Showtime (TV network)") premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [Steven Soderbergh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh "Steven Soderbergh"), [Jonathan Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kaplan "Jonathan Kaplan"), [Peter Bogdanovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich "Peter Bogdanovich"), and [Tom Hanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks "Tom Hanks"). The episode was entitled, "Murder, Obliquely" (1993) starring [Laura Dern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Dern "Laura Dern"), [Alan Rickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman "Alan Rickman"), and [Diane Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Lane "Diane Lane").[^9]

In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, *[A Little Princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Princess_\(1995_film\) "A Little Princess (1995 film)")*, an adaptation of [Frances Hodgson Burnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Hodgson_Burnett "Frances Hodgson Burnett") 's classic [1905 novel of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Princess "A Little Princess"). The film received critical acclaim with [Janet Maslin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin "Janet Maslin") of *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* declaring, "\[the film\] is a bright, beautiful and enchantingly childlike vision", one that "draw\[s\] its audience into the wittily heightened reality of a fairy tale" and "takes enough liberties to re-invent rather than embalm Miss Burnett's assiduously beloved story".[^10] The film went on to receive two [Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award "Academy Award") nominations for [Best Cinematography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography "Academy Award for Best Cinematography") and [Best Production Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Production_Design "Academy Award for Best Production Design").[^11] Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens "Charles Dickens") 's *[Great Expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations_\(1998_film\) "Great Expectations (1998 film)")* starring [Ethan Hawke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Hawke "Ethan Hawke"), [Gwyneth Paltrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwyneth_Paltrow "Gwyneth Paltrow"), and [Robert De Niro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro"). The film received mixed reviews to negative reviews.[^12] Russell Smith of *[The Austin Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Austin_Chronicle "The Austin Chronicle")* did however praise the film writing, ". What's truly intriguing about this film, though, is the stylishness with which Cuaron (A Little Princess) reinvents Dickens' hoary, often-remade tale. This *Great Expectations* has a seductive, enchanting feel that has nothing to do with sweet, gauzy sentiments or calculatedly “magical” Hollywood imagery".[^13]

Cuarón and Clive Owen. They worked together on Children of Men.

In 2001, Cuarón found himself returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film *[Y tu mamá también](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_tu_mam%C3%A1_tambi%C3%A9n "Y tu mamá también")*, starring [Gael García Bernal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gael_Garc%C3%ADa_Bernal "Gael García Bernal"), [Diego Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Luna "Diego Luna") and [Maribel Verdú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maribel_Verd%C3%BA "Maribel Verdú"). It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman who is much older than they. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics.[^14] [^15] The film was distributed through IFC in America allowing the film to collect $13.8 million in the United States, unparalleled at the time for Latin American films.[^16] Critic [Roger Ebert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") of *[The Chicago Sun-Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Sun-Times "The Chicago Sun-Times")* wrote, "It is clear Cuaron is a gifted director, and here he does his best work to date." [^17] Cuarón shared an [Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") nomination for [Best Original Screenplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay") with co-writer and brother [Carlos Cuarón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Cuar%C3%B3n "Carlos Cuarón").

In 2004, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful *[Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_\(film_series\) "Harry Potter (film series)")* series, *[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_\(film\) "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)")*. Cuarón faced criticism at the time from some *[Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter "Harry Potter")* fans for his approach to the film, notably its tendency to take more creative liberties with the source material than its predecessors.[^18] However, author [J. K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling "J. K. Rowling"), who had seen and loved Cuarón's film *Y tu mamá también*, said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.[^19] Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking its new tone and for being the first *Harry Potter* film to truly capture the essence of the novels.[^20] It has been subsequently rated by audience polls and critics as the best of the movie franchise series.[^21] The film earned two [Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award "Academy Award") nominations for [Best Visual Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects") and [Best Original Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Academy Award for Best Original Score") for [John Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams "John Williams").[^22]

In 2006, Cuarón's feature *[Children of Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Men "Children of Men")*, an adaptation of the [P. D. James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._D._James "P. D. James") [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children_of_Men "The Children of Men") starring [Clive Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Owen "Clive Owen"), [Julianne Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julianne_Moore "Julianne Moore"), and [Michael Caine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Caine "Michael Caine"), received wide critical acclaim including three Academy Award nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film, in [Best Film Editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Film_Editing "Academy Award for Best Film Editing") (with [Alex Rodríguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodr%C3%ADguez_\(film_editor\) "Alex Rodríguez (film editor)")) and [Best Adapted Screenplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay") (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company [Esperanto Filmoj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_Filmoj "Esperanto Filmoj") ("Esperanto Films", named because of his support for the international language [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto") [^23]), which has credits in the films *[Duck Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporada_de_patos "Temporada de patos")*, *[Pan's Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%27s_Labyrinth "Pan's Labyrinth")*, and *[Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_\(2013_film\) "Gravity (2013 film)")*. He was also a co-founder of the production company, the "Tequila Gang" together with filmmaker [Guillermo del Toro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro "Guillermo del Toro"), screenwriter [Laura Esquivel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Esquivel "Laura Esquivel"), producer Berta Navarro and sales agent Rosa Bosch.[^24]

Cuarón directed the controversial public service announcement *I Am Autism* (2009) for [Autism Speaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks "Autism Speaks") that was criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.[^25]

Cuaron at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival

In 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film *Gravity*, a drama set in space. He was joined by producer [David Heyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heyman "David Heyman"), with whom Cuarón worked on *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. Starring [Sandra Bullock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Bullock "Sandra Bullock") and [George Clooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney "George Clooney"), the film opened the [70th Venice International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70th_Venice_International_Film_Festival "70th Venice International Film Festival") in August. The film was then released in America in October 2013.[^26] The film became a financial success, earning 723.2 million at the box office against a budget of 130 million.[^27] The film also received many awards nominations.

Cuarón in 2013

In 2013, Cuarón created *[Believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe_\(TV_series\) "Believe (TV series)")*, a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that was broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC") as a mid-season entry. The series was created by Cuarón for [Bad Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Robot "Bad Robot") and [Warner Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros.") Television. In 2014, *[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* placed him in its list of " [100 Most Influential People in the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Most_Influential_People_in_the_World "100 Most Influential People in the World") " – Pioneers.[^29]

In May 2015, Cuarón was announced as the president of the jury for the [72nd Venice International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Venice_International_Film_Festival "72nd Venice International Film Festival").[^30]

Production began in fall 2016 for Cuarón's eighth film, *[Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_\(2018_film\) "Roma (2018 film)")*, a tale of a housekeeper for a middle class Mexican family in 1970s Mexico City, based on the life of his family's longtime maid, Liboria Rodríguez.[^31] The project was produced by Cuarón, [Gabriela Rodríguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriela_Rodr%C3%ADguez_\(producer\) "Gabriela Rodríguez (producer)") and [Nicolás Celis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Celis_\(film_producer\) "Nicolás Celis (film producer)") and starred [Yalitza Aparicio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalitza_Aparicio "Yalitza Aparicio") and [Marina de Tavira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_de_Tavira "Marina de Tavira") both of whom received [Oscar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") nominations. The film debuted at the [75th Venice International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Venice_International_Film_Festival "75th Venice International Film Festival"), where it won the [Golden Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lion "Golden Lion"),[^32] and was distributed to select Mexican and American theaters before its online release on [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix"). *Roma* was highly acclaimed upon release; among its accolades are two Golden Globes ([Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Foreign_Language_Film "Best Foreign Language Film") and Best Director for Cuarón) and three Academy Awards (Best Director, [Best Foreign Language Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_International_Feature_Film "Academy Award for Best International Feature Film"), and [Best Cinematography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography "Academy Award for Best Cinematography") for Cuarón) out of a leading ten nominations.[^33] [^34]

Cuarón in 2024

In 2019, Cuaron signed an overall TV deal at [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.").[^35] His first series for Apple was the psychological thriller *[Disclaimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclaimer_\(TV_series\) "Disclaimer (TV series)")*, starring [Cate Blanchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Blanchett "Cate Blanchett"), [Kevin Kline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kline "Kevin Kline"), [Louis Partridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Partridge "Louis Partridge") and [Sasha Baron Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Baron_Cohen "Sacha Baron Cohen"); it is based on the eponymous novel by Renée Knight, with Cuaron writing and directing every episode.[^36]

Cuaron's style is a mix of several mainstream Hollywood conventions while breaking from that dominant influence by taking an unorthodox approach that uses voiceover narration and by unconventionally lengthy shots. These longer cuts, narration, and often, moving cameras are more typical of [documentary film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film "Documentary film").[^37]

In his first feature film the average shot length is around six seconds, and ten years later for *Y Tu Mama Tambien* the average increased to 19.6 seconds. *The Prisoner of Azkaban* had an average of 5 1 ⁄ 2 seconds, while the subsequent *Children of Men* had an extraordinary average of 16 seconds between cuts. A typical Hollywood movie cuts every two seconds.[^38] Cuarón's career shows mainstream Hollywood influences, which has spilled over to less mainstream films made outside of Hollywood. *Children of Men* was influenced by disaster and science fiction movie conventions. *The Prisoner of Azkaban* was a continuation of Cuarón's take on the coming-of-age genre after *Y, Tu Mama Tambien*.[^39] That film is in the form of an American road movie, along with teen movie elements.[^40] Voice-over narration adds a documentary feel. The narration, interjected by a non-diagetic voice not belonging to any character, highlights the socioeconomic state of not only the main characters, but also minor characters who otherwise seem irrelevant to the overall narrative.

As mentioned above, the voice-over narration in *Y Tu Mama Tambien* contains political messages. In the aforementioned film Cuarón tackles Mexican identity and sovereignty. With the backdrop of the 1990s and the advent of NAFTA and neoliberalism in Mexico, Cuarón critiques Mexico for the path they are heading towards a globalized economy and world.[^41] Cuarón also addresses Mexican history such as colonialism and the long unfulfilled promises of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Using the same film as an example the narrator states that a new political party is in power, but hints that no real change will come about. This is also supported with one of the main characters, Julio, sharing a last name with the Mexican Revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, yet the name does not push Julio into action or in other words he lacks the initiative and interest in the country.[^42] These same themes of identity and history, particularly of Mexico, were first addressed in his first feature film *Solo con tu pareja*. In both films Cuarón uses allegory that ties into a national identity and/or history. On top of these themes he also tackles class, but that can be considered a subcategory of economics or politics in which he already grapples with.

## Personal life

Cuarón's first marriage was to Mariana Elizondo with whom he has a son, [Jonás Cuarón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon%C3%A1s_Cuar%C3%B3n "Jonás Cuarón"), born in 1981. Jonás is also a film director, known for *[Year of the Nail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Nail "Year of the Nail")* and *[Desierto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desierto "Desierto")*.[^43] Alfonso's second marriage, from 2001 to 2008, was to Italian actress and freelance journalist Annalisa Bugliani, with whom he has two children.[^43]

He has publicly shown his fascination for the Esperanto language and his support for the [Esperanto movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_movement "Esperanto movement").[^44] He called his production company Esperanto Filmoj. In October 2023, Cuarón signed an open letter from artists to US President Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire of [Israeli bombardment in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war").[^45]

Cuarón is a vegetarian [^37] [^46] and has been living in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") since 2000.[^47]
