***Come and See* [^2] is a 1985** Soviet [historical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama "Historical drama") [anti-war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anti-war_films "List of anti-war films") film directed by [Elem Klimov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elem_Klimov "Elem Klimov") and starring [Aleksei Kravchenko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Kravchenko_\(actor\) "Aleksei Kravchenko (actor)") and Olga Mironova.[^6] Its screenplay, written by Klimov and [Ales Adamovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ales_Adamovich "Ales Adamovich"), is based on the 1971 novel *Khatyn* [^7] ([Russian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): Хаты́нь) and the 1977 collection of survivor testimonies *I Am from the Fiery Village* [^8] (Я из огненной деревни, *Ya iz ognennoy derevni*),[^9] of which Adamovich was a co-author.[^10] Klimov had to fight eight years of censorship from the Soviet authorities before he was allowed to produce the film in its entirety.[^11] [^12]

The film's plot focuses on the [German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Byelorussia_during_World_War_II "German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II"), and the events as witnessed by a young Belarusian teenager named Flyora, who joins a [partisan unit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_partisans "Soviet partisans"), and thereafter depicts the Nazi atrocities and human suffering inflicted upon the populace. The film mixes hyper-realism with an underlying [surrealism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism"), and philosophical [existentialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism") with poetical, psychological, political and apocalyptic themes. The film received positive reviews during its initial release and received the [FIPRESCI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Film_Critics "International Federation of Film Critics") prize at the [14th Moscow International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival "14th Moscow International Film Festival"). It is the last film that Klimov directed before his death.

*Come and See* has received widespread acclaim in more recent years. The portrayal of the horror, bloody brutality, and psychological damage of the [Khatyn massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatyn_massacre "Khatyn massacre") and the broader Nazi terror of [German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Byelorussia_during_World_War_II "German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II") has been widely praised by critics, and Kravchenko's performance has been lauded as one of the best instances of child acting in a motion picture. It has since come to be considered one of the [greatest films of all time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best "List of films considered the best"), particularly in the anti-war film genre; in the [2022 *Sight & Sound* directors' poll of the Greatest Films of all Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sight_and_Sound_Greatest_Films_of_All_Time_2022#Directors'_poll "The Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2022"), it ranked 41st.[^13]

A Focke-Wulf Fw 189. A reconnaissance aircraft of this model repeatedly appears in scenes flying above Flyora's head throughout Come and See.

In 1943, Flyora and another [Belarusian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusians "Belarusians") boy dig up a rifle from a trench to join the [Soviet partisans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_partisans "Soviet partisans"). They do so in defiance of their village elder, who warns them that this would arouse the suspicions of the [occupying Germans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"). The boys' activities are noticed by a [Fw 189](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_189_Uhu "Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu") reconnaissance aircraft.

The next day, partisans arrive at Flyora's house to [conscript](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") him against his mother's wishes. Flyora is taken to a partisan camp in the forest, where he becomes a low-rank [militiaman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia "Militia") who performs menial tasks. When those partisans trained to fight leave, their commander Kosach orders Flyora and several other men to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping. He comes across Glasha, an emotionally unstable adolescent girl working as a partisan nurse. The forest is suddenly attacked by [dive bombers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_bomber "Dive bomber") and [German paratroopers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger "Fallschirmjäger"), forcing the duo to flee. They hide from German officers passing through the forest and sleep under a tree for the night.

Flyora and Glasha travel to his village, only to find it deserted. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes they are hiding on a nearby island across a [bog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog "Bog") and runs off. Glasha follows, by chance seeing a pile of executed villagers behind his house, before yelling at Flyora to leave quickly. They become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha screams at Flyora that his family is dead. Rubezh, a partisan fighter, rescues them and takes them to meet the surviving villagers. The village elder, severely burned by gasoline, tells Flyora of his family's deaths and repeats his warning about digging up the rifle. Flyora attempts suicide out of guilt by submerging his head in the bog, but Glasha and the villagers stop him.

Rubezh takes Flyora and two other men to raid a warehouse for food. The group find the warehouse unexpectedly guarded by German troops and are forced to retreat. Rubezh and Flyora's two comrades are killed by a [land mine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine "Land mine"). Rubezh and Flyora coerce a Nazi-collaborating farmer to hand over his cow, but a German [machine gun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun "Machine gun") kills Rubezh and the cow. Flyora attempts to steal a horse and cart from another man to transport the cow, but he convinces Flyora to hide his gun and [Red Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army") jacket as [SS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel "Schutzstaffel") troops appear. He takes Flyora to his house in Perekhody village.

German troops and [collaborators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_in_the_German-occupied_Soviet_Union "Collaboration in the German-occupied Soviet Union") surround and occupy the village. Flyora runs outside and sees women, children, and the elderly being forcibly marched down the street. Flyora warns them that they are being herded to their deaths, but he is forced into a [barn church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_church "Barn church") with them. The Germans barricade the doors, leaving the people inside screaming while the soldiers laugh. Flyora and a young woman with a child exit the church; the woman's child is thrown back in while she is dragged off to be [gang raped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape "Gang rape"). The soldiers throw explosives into the church and barricade the windows. The church is set on fire, killing everyone inside as the soldiers celebrate. A German officer holds a pistol to Flyora's head to pose for a picture, then abandons him as the soldiers leave.

These two photos ([Klara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klara_Hitler "Klara Hitler"); left, and [Adolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"); right) were merged by Klimov to create the picture that Flyora stops shooting at.

Flyora wanders away from the scorched village, finding the aftermath of a partisan ambush on the escaping Germans. Flyora recovers his jacket and rifle, only to spot the gang-raped woman, bleeding and stumbling in a [fugue state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_fugue "Dissociative fugue"). He finds Kosach and the partisans nearby, having captured some of the Germans and their collaborators responsible for the church fire. They plead for their lives, blaming a fanatical and unapologetic *[Obersturmführer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obersturmf%C3%BChrer "Obersturmführer")*. Kosach suggests that one collaborator douse the others with petrol; he willingly does so, but the partisans shoot them all before they can be set on fire.

As the partisans leave, Flyora notices a boy looking at a painting of Hitler in a puddle. When the boy leaves, Flyora repeatedly shoots the portrait; a [montage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_\(filmmaking\) "Montage (filmmaking)") of clips from Hitler's life plays in reverse, but when Hitler is shown as a baby on [his mother](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klara_Hitler "Klara Hitler") 's lap, Flyora stops shooting and cries. A title card states, " [628 Belorussian villages were destroyed, along with all their inhabitants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Byelorussia_during_World_War_II#War_crimes "German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II") ".[^12] Flyora rushes to rejoin his comrades.

Klimov co-wrote the screenplay with [Ales Adamovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ales_Adamovich "Ales Adamovich"), who fought with the Belarusian partisans as a teenager. According to the director's recollections, work on the film began in 1977:

> The 40th [anniversary of the Great Victory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_\(9_May\) "Victory Day (9 May)") was approaching.[^8] [^14] [^15] The management had to be given something topical. I had been reading and rereading the book *I Am from the Fiery Village*, which consisted of the first-hand accounts of people who miraculously survived the horrors of the fascist genocide in Belorussia. Many of them were still alive then, and Belorussians managed to record some of their memories onto film. I will never forget the face and eyes of one peasant, and his quiet recollection about how his whole village had been herded into a church, and how just before they were about to be burned, an officer gave them the offer: "Whoever has no children can leave". And he couldn't take it, he left, and left behind his wife and little kids... or about how another village was burned: the adults were all herded into a barn, but the children were left behind. And later, the drunk men surrounded them with sheepdogs and let the dogs tear the children to pieces.
> 
> And then I thought: the world doesn't know about [Khatyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatyn_massacre "Khatyn massacre")! They know about [Katyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre "Katyn massacre"), about the massacre of the Polish officers there. But they don't know about Belorussia. Even though more than 600 villages were burned there!
> 
> And I decided to make a film about this tragedy. I perfectly understood that the film would end up a harsh one. I decided that the central role of the village lad Flyora would not be played by a professional actor, who upon immersion into a difficult role could have protected himself psychologically with his accumulated acting experience, technique and skill. I wanted to find a simple boy fourteen years of age. We had to prepare him for the most difficult experiences, then capture them on film. And at the same time, we had to protect him from the stresses so that he wasn't left in the loony bin after filming was over, but was returned to his mother alive and healthy. Fortunately, with Aleksei Kravchenko, who played Flyora and who later became a good actor, everything went smoothly.
> 
> The events with the people, the peasants, actually happened as shown in the film. \[It\] doesn't have any professional actors. Even the language spoken in the film is Belarusian. What was important was that all the events depicted in the film really did happen in Belarus.
> 
> I understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay co-author, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: "Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace." [^11]

> —  Elem Klimov [^16]

The original Belarusian and Russian title of the film derives from Chapter 6 of the [Book of Revelation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"), where in the first, third, fifth, and seventh verse is written " Ідзі і глядзі " in Belarusian [^17] (English: ["Come and see"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\(King_James\)/Revelation#6:1 "s:Bible (King James)/Revelation"), [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): [Ἔρχου καὶ ἴδε](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+6:1%E2%80%937&version=sblgnt), *Erchou kai ide* [^18] and " Иди и смотри " in Russian) as an invitation to look upon the destruction caused by the [Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse").[^19] [^20] [Chapter 6, verses 7–8](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\(King_James\)/Revelation#6:7 "s:Bible (King James)/Revelation") have been cited as being particularly relevant to the film:

> And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, "Come and see!" And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

To prepare the 14-year-old Kravchenko for the role, Klimov called a [hypnotist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis "Hypnosis") with [autogenic training](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogenic_training "Autogenic training").[^21] "\[Kravchenko's acting\] could have had a very sad ending. He could have landed in an insane asylum," Klimov said.[^21] "I realized I had to inject him with content which he did not possess," "This is an age when a boy does not know what true hatred is, what true love is." "In the end, Mr. Kravchenko was able to concentrate so intensely that it seemed as if he had hypnotized himself for the role." [^22] [^23]

For eight years,[^14] filming could not begin because the [State Committee for Cinematography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Committee_for_Cinematography "State Committee for Cinematography") (*Goskino*) would not accept the screenplay, considering it too realistic, calling it propaganda for the "aesthetics of dirtiness" and "naturalism".[^11] Alongside this, the death of Klimov's wife [Larisa Shepitko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larisa_Shepitko "Larisa Shepitko"), also a filmmaker, in 1979 forced him to first complete the work she began on what was to be her next film, *[Farewell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farewell_\(1983_film\) "Farewell (1983 film)")*; it would finally be released in 1983.[^24] Eventually in 1984, Klimov was able to start filming without having compromised to any censorship at all. The only change became the name of the film itself, to *Come and See* from the original, *Kill Hitler* [^22] [^21] (Klimov also says this in the 2006 UK DVD release).[^25]

The film was shot in chronological order over a period of nine months.[^22] Kravchenko said that he underwent "the most debilitating fatigue and hunger. I kept a most severe diet, and after the filming was over I returned to school not only thin, but grey-haired." [^22] [^26] Contrary to what some rumors suggest, though, Kravchenko's hair did not turn permanently grey. In fact, a special silver Interferenz [greasepaint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasepaint "Greasepaint"), alongside a thin layer of actual silver, was used to dye his hair. This made it difficult to get it back to normal, so Kravchenko had to live with his hair like this for some time after shooting the film.[^21]

To create the maximum sense of immediacy, [realism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_\(arts\) "Realism (arts)"), [hyperrealism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrealism "Hyperrealism"), and [surrealism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism") operating in equal measure,[^27] Klimov and his cameraman [Aleksei Rodionov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Rodionov "Aleksei Rodionov") employed naturalistic colors and lots of [Steadicam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam "Steadicam") shots; the film is full of extreme [close-ups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up "Close-up") of faces, does not flinch from the unpleasant details of burnt flesh and bloodied corpses, and the guns were often loaded with live ammunition as opposed to [blanks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_\(cartridge\) "Blank (cartridge)").[^8] [^22] [^21] [^28] [^29] Kravchenko mentioned in interviews that bullets sometimes passed just 4 inches (10 centimeters) above his head [^22] (such as in the cow scene). Very little protection was provided on the set. When the dive bombs were detonated the camera crew only had a concrete slab 1.5 meters tall and 5 meters wide (4 ft 11 in × 16 ft 5 in) to protect them.[^8] At the same time the *[mise-en-scène](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne "Mise-en-scène")* is fragmentary and disjointed: there are discontinuities between shots as characters appear in close up and then disappear off camera. Elsewhere, the moment of revelation is marked by a disorienting [zoom-in/dolly-out](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom "Dolly zoom") shot.[^8]

The original soundtrack is rhythmically amorphous music composed by Oleg Yanchenko.[^14] [^30] At a few key points in the film classical music from mainly German or Austrian composers are used, such as *[The Blue Danube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Danube "The Blue Danube")* by [Johann Strauss II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strauss_II "Johann Strauss II").[^31] The Soviet marching song " [The Sacred War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sacred_War "The Sacred War") " [^32] and Russian folk song " [Korobeiniki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korobeiniki "Korobeiniki") " ([Vadim Kozin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Kozin "Vadim Kozin")) (lit.' "Pedlars" ') [^30] are played in the movie once. During the scene where Glasha dances, the background music is some fragments of Mary Dixon's song from [Grigori Aleksandrov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Aleksandrov "Grigori Aleksandrov") 's 1936 film *[Circus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_\(1936_film\) "Circus (1936 film)")*.[^30] [^33] At the end, during the photographic montage, music by [Richard Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner "Richard Wagner") is used, most notably *[Ride of the Valkyries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_of_the_Valkyries "Ride of the Valkyries")*.[^30]

At the end of the film, the partisans walk through a winter woodland to the sound of [Mozart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart") 's *[Lacrimosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_\(Mozart\)#f._Lacrymosa "Requiem (Mozart)")* before the camera tilts towards the sky and the ending credits appear.[^30] Film critic [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") commented on this scene as follows:[^34]

> There's a curious scene here in a wood, the sun falling down through the leaves, when the soundtrack, which has been grim and mournful, suddenly breaks free into Mozart. And what does this signify? A fantasy, I believe, and not Florya's \[*[sic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")*\], who has probably never heard such music. The Mozart descends into the film like a [deus ex machina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina "Deus ex machina"), to lift us from its despair. We can accept it if we want, but it changes nothing. It is like an ironic taunt.

*Come and See* had its world premiere in the competition program at the [14th Moscow International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival "14th Moscow International Film Festival") on 9 July 1985.[^35] It was theatrically released on 17 October 1985,[^36] drawing 28.9 million viewers [^12] [^22] and ranking sixth at the box office of 1986.[^12] It grossed $71,909 in the United States and Canada,[^36] and $20.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of nearly $21 million,[^5] plus nearly $1.3 million with home video sales.[^36]

In 2017, the film received an official restoration overseen by [Karen Shakhnazarov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Shakhnazarov "Karen Shakhnazarov"). It won the Venice Classics Award for *Best Restored Film*, and was also shown in several European independent cinemas again.[^37] [^38] [^39]

In 2001 the film was released on [DVD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD "DVD") in the United States by [Kino Lorber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino_Lorber "Kino Lorber"). This release is currently [out-of-print](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-print "Out-of-print"). The film became available on [FilmStruck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FilmStruck "FilmStruck"),[^15] the streaming service for [the Criterion Collection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criterion_Collection "The Criterion Collection") from its opening on 1 November 2016 to its closing on 29 November 2018, and from November 2019 on the new Criterion Channel service.[^40] On 18 December 2019, [Janus Films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Films "Janus Films") released a trailer [^41] [^42] for a 2k-restoration that premiered at the [Film Forum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Forum "Film Forum") in New York City on 21 February 2020 [^43] [^44] with a theatrical run [^45] [^44] and then a home media release through Criterion was released on 30 June 2020.[^46] [^36]

The performance of [Aleksei Kravchenko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Kravchenko_\(actor\) "Aleksei Kravchenko (actor)") (aged 14 at the time of the film's production) was widely acclaimed, and is considered by critics as one of the greatest ever performances by a child actor.[^47] [^48]

Initial reception was positive. [Walter Goodman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Goodman_\(critic\) "Walter Goodman (critic)") wrote for *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* that "The history is harrowing and the presentation is graphic... Powerful material, powerfully rendered...", and dismissed the ending as "a dose of instant inspirationalism," but conceded to Klimov's "unquestionable talent." [^49] Rita Kempley, of *[The Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")*, wrote that "directing with an angry eloquence, \[Klimov\] taps into that hallucinatory nether world of blood and mud and escalating madness that [Francis Ford Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola "Francis Ford Coppola") found in *[Apocalypse Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now "Apocalypse Now").* And though he draws a surprisingly vivid performance from his inexperienced teen lead, Klimov's prowess is his visual poetry, muscular and animistic, like compatriot [Andrei Konchalovsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Konchalovsky "Andrei Konchalovsky") 's in his epic *[Siberiade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberiade "Siberiade")*." [^50] Mark Le Fanu wrote in *[Sight & Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound "Sight & Sound")* that *Come and See* is a "powerful war film... The director has elicited an excellent performance from his central actor Kravchenko".[^51]

According to Klimov, the film was so shocking for audiences that ambulances were sometimes called in to take away particularly impressionable viewers, both in the Soviet Union and abroad.[^14] [^25]

*Come and See* was selected as the Soviet entry for the [Best Foreign Language Film at the 58th Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submissions_to_the_58th_Academy_Awards_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film "List of submissions to the 58th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film"), but was not accepted as a nominee.[^52]

The film has since been widely praised in later decades. On [review aggregator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), the film holds an approval rating of 90%, based on 58 reviews, with an [average](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean "Weighted arithmetic mean") rating of 9.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "As effectively anti-war as movies can be, *Come and See* is a harrowing odyssey through the worst that humanity is capable of, directed with bravura intensity by Elem Klimov." [^6]

In 2001, Daneet Steffens of *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")* wrote that "Klimov alternates the horrors of war with occasional fairy tale-like images; together they imbue the film with an unapologetically disturbing quality that persists long after the credits roll." [^55]

In 2001, [J. Hoberman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hoberman "J. Hoberman") of *[The Village Voice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice "The Village Voice")* reviewed *Come and See*, writing the following: "Directed for baroque intensity, *Come and See* is a robust art film with aspirations to the visionary – not so much graphic as leisurely literal-minded in its representation of mass murder. (The movie has been compared both to *[Schindler's List](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List "Schindler's List")* and *[Saving Private Ryan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan "Saving Private Ryan")*, and it would not be surprising to learn that [Steven Spielberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg "Steven Spielberg") had screened it before making either of these.) The film's central atrocity is a barbaric circus of blaring music and barking dogs in which a squadron of drunken German soldiers round up and parade the peasants to their fiery doom... The bit of actual death-camp corpse footage that Klimov uses is doubly disturbing in that it retrospectively diminishes the care with which he orchestrates the town's destruction. For the most part, he prefers to show the [Gorgon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon "Gorgon") as reflected in [Perseus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus "Perseus") 's shield. There are few images more indelible than the sight of young Aleksei Kravchenko's fear-petrified expression." [^56] In the same publication in 2009, [Elliott Stein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Stein "Elliott Stein") described *Come and See* as "a startling mixture of lyrical poeticism and expressionist nightmare." [^57]

In 2002, Scott Tobias of *[The A.V. Club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club "The A.V. Club")* wrote that Klimov's "impressions are unforgettable: the screaming cacophony of a bombing run broken up by the faint sound of a Mozart fugue, a dark, arid field suddenly lit up by eerily beautiful orange flares, German troops appearing like ghosts out of the heavy morning fog. A product of the *[glasnost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost "Glasnost")* era, *Come and See* is far from a patriotic memorial of Russia's hard-won victory. Instead, it's a chilling reminder of that victory's terrible costs." [^58] British magazine *[The Word](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Word_\(UK_magazine\) "The Word (UK magazine)")* wrote that " *Come and See* is widely regarded as the finest war film ever made, though possibly not by *[Great Escape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Escape_\(film\) "The Great Escape (film)")* fans." [^59] [Tim Lott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Lott "Tim Lott") wrote in 2009 that the film "makes *Apocalypse Now* look lightweight".[^60]

In 2006, Geoffrey Macnab of *Sight & Sound* wrote: "Klimov's astonishing war movie combines intense lyricism with the kind of violent bloodletting that would make even [Sam Peckinpah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Peckinpah "Sam Peckinpah") pause".[^61]

On 16 June 2010, Roger Ebert posted a review of *Come and See* as part of his "Great Movies" series, describing it as "one of the most devastating films ever about anything, and in it, the survivors must envy the dead... The film depicts brutality and is occasionally very realistic, but there's an overlay of muted nightmarish exaggeration... I must not describe the famous sequence at the end. It must unfold as a surprise for you. It pretends to roll back history. You will see how. It is unutterably depressing, because history can never undo itself, and is with us forever." [^34]

*Come and See* appears on many [lists of films considered the best](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best "List of films considered the best"). In 2008, *Come and See* was placed at number 60 on *[Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(magazine\) "Empire (magazine)")* magazine's "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time".[^62] It also made [Channel 4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4 "Channel 4") 's list of *[50 Films to See Before You Die](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Films_to_See_Before_You_Die "50 Films to See Before You Die")* [^63] and was ranked number 24 in *Empire* magazine's "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" in 2010.[^64] Phil de Semlyen of *Empire* has described the work as "Elim \[*[sic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")*\] Klimov’s seriously influential, deeply unsettling Belarusian opus. No film – not *Apocalypse Now*, not *[Full Metal Jacket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket "Full Metal Jacket")* – spells out the dehumanizing impact of conflict more vividly, or ferociously... An impressionist masterpiece and possibly the worst date movie ever." [^65] It ranked 154 among critics, and 30 among directors, in the [2012 *Sight & Sound* polls of the greatest films ever made](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sight_%26_Sound_Greatest_Films_of_All_Time_2012 "The Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2012"),[^66] while it ranked 104 among critics, and 41 among directors, in the [2022 *Sight & Sound* polls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sight_and_Sound_Greatest_Films_of_All_Time_2022 "The Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2022").[^13] The film is generally considered one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made, and one with the most historically accurate depictions of the crimes on the Eastern Front.[^22] [^16] [^67] [^68] [^69] [^70]

Klimov did not make any more films after *Come and See*,[^71] leading some critics to speculate as to why. In 2001, Klimov said, "I lost interest in making films... Everything that was possible I felt I had already done." [^23]
