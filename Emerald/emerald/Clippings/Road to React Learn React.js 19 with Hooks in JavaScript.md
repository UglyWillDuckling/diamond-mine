### What participants are saying

**[Batty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK12HO6J0BY8M):***"The book and let alone the resources offered by this book and it's author are simply phenomenal. It's extremely easy to work through and play around with the code while you follow along. The additional reading links offered are extremely helpful and well thought out. It's refreshing to find a codebook that keeps you glued and connected. Initially, when first approaching React, I had purchased a Udemy course from another teacher. However, I found myself getting quite lost after just a few videos. The teacher in that highly rated series kept it easy at first but then blindsides you with hard to grasp concepts and code and failed to inform well what was going on. It was from my discouragement that I looked for another resource and came across this book. The author is very adept at keeping you informed and taking you through one step at a time. He doesn't dumb it down nor does he prattle on. Rather he keeps right on track, concise, and informative. He reminds me of my favorite professor in college. In addition to such as well organized and structured learning tool, there is also a slack group community and a Github for the code/project. If you are wanting to learn React, I would absolutely grab this book."*

**[Matthew Flower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19SY81RZT6D0G):***"I have been an engineer for over 20 years. I have Javascript knowledge, but it is at least 5 years out of date. I found that this book was absolutely perfect to teach me React and some basics in ES6 that pertain to React. The book iteratively develops a web site using the HackerRank APIs. Concepts are sometimes introduced through sample JavaScript code, other times by modifying the application to use or replace code using a new feature you are learning. In addition, many sections will have links to either the react website, Mozillaâ€™s website, or to the authorâ€™s own website where he might go into much more depth."*

**[Sirch Huxley](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1357N3OQHWK5):***"First off I like to say that Robin Wieruch's presentation on the React material is, bar none, the best I have ever come across, period!. Prior to reading his book, on the subject at hand, I had tried and failed miserably to learn React in full with 2 other 5-star rated books, but Mr. Wieruch's approach finally made the connections I needed to grasp the concepts of state vs. stateless, ES6 standards, asynchronous features, etc. I can't wait to start on his second book covering React-Redux (Taming the State in React: Your journey to master Redux and MobX ). Mr. Wieruch thank you for your wonderful book and hard work covering the React Material, and if I had to make any suggestion you think you can continue the book series, maybe a follow-up on Webpack, Jest and Flux, a book on each subject would make the best, full React series ever. Thanks again!"*

**[Kieu Hua](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RLB28S1JXGU7):***"I am lucky to discover this book, because React, GraphQL, Apollo, Client and Server are bleeding edges technologies, and this book is the best resources that you can find at the current time to learn about these subjects. I followed Robinâ€™s examples closely, and each section you can download the source code to compare with your code."*

**[Z. H. Staples](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ8LLLC7DE4TW):***"This is an amazing way to learn React. As an experienced programmer, but new to Javascript, I was looking for a fast moving course that hit every major topic in React and provided fully worked examples I could copy. I've found over the years that the best way for me to pick up a new programming language is to just start typing. Robin Wieruch's book is perfect for this learning style. The book opens with a simple application that is fully up and running by the end of the the first chapter. When a more detailed exploration is desired, Robin provides over 200 footnotes to detailed online content. As each chapter progresses the original App is made more robust and complex until the project culminates in pushing to live production on Heroku. If you are on the road to learn React, I cannot think of a better way to start then taking a week to push through this book."*

**[Big Time Games](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27F1TF1GGES5A):***"I loved the book -- the explanation detail, the pace, the content seems perfect. I had been fooling w/ a few demo packages but felt I needed more depth to understand what I am doing better. This seems like a great intro. I can't be sure since I would need to become alot better in React before I can stay this was the right road or not."*

**[M. B. Kauffman](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36CJ4XXLLHG4Y):***"I've just started to learn react out of necessity for a project at work. This book has very good reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's been a great boon, especially for a guy who hasn't touched Javascript since 2002. The examples are clear, the step-by-step nature really helps, and you get just enough background along the way to understand more of what's happening under the hood. But not too much. Thank you Robin!"*

**[Micah Raleigh](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7S9GV7F38FWH):***"Just finished The Road To Learn React by Robin Wieruch. I had written several React POC type projects and this was a good way to get deep on the fundamentals and background in the ES6 ecosystem. Especially liked the parts on unidirectional flows, fetch, and spread operators. Lots of small-ish examples."*

**[Anton](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OUCEQSBM7J74):***"This book really worth to buy. Author are really try to split the content of this book on simple and small understandable parts, after ich part exercises for memorise (which I recommend not to pass ) and when you "buy" this book and author make sure that purchase was, you will find out that you get much more than just a book. Honestly I very rarely write reviews but this product oblige me to do that."*

**[D. Collins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M6EH21PD30U):***"Great book! React can be complicated but Robin breaks it all down and the React introduction is perfect, without long-winded explanations that leave the reader scratching their head."*

**[Omrip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10III63ZASRPG):***"It was my first foray into the react world and I'm totally impressed! it was very clear, in depth and easy to follow. Highly recommended!"*

**[Scott Rhamy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22H6XOPA7JL2S):***"I absolutely love this, and all of robin's books. He has a well publicized knack for explaining difficult subject in a stepwise, concise, and clear way. I can honestly say, his books have been one of the best resources I have found in learning React and better javascript."*

**[Chris Zehner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36DSHPGT5V9N7):***"The best way to learn React! I bought this because I had a job interview coming up where I was asked to complete a project in React. I sat down on a Saturday and worked through The Road to Learn React and on Sunday I completed my project with plenty of time left before my interview Wednesday. In one weekend I went from 0% to 80% comfortable working independently in React. The Road to Learn React is probably the best way to get functionally proficient at React. I work at Facebook and I think this book is better than even our internal resources."*

**[Fabio CortÃ©s](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3POYYO48ARXJN):***"This book is awesome. I read this one as my entry point to React and it was incredible. Not only teaches you React.js from scratch but also modern javascript and good practices for real life work with the framework. Along the book, you will find a project where you will apply all the concepts and tools, so you not only will have a good theoretical reference but a hands on experience to get starded with react. This one was my first contact with React, and a couple of months later, I have my first professional project for a real cient using this framework. Author's blog is also a good reference for all React's related topics, totally recommended."*

**[C. Finn](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DZET7ESK57LM):***"This book is hands down the best introduction to anything programming related I have ever read. Robin is truly skilled at easing the reader into the React ecosystem. One of my favorite things about the book is how thoroughly he describes why he makes the programming choices he makes & why parts of React are the way they are. He also bestows upon the readers many words of wisdom to make sure you write good, professional level code. I am definitely purchasing his next book, Taming the State & have high hopes that it can teach me about state management as well as this book has taught me React."*

**[Tony Brown](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HK929GB4Y2C3):***"This is a pure joy to read and go through the building of an example application. I have the PDF and interactive tutorial on educative.io I can't say enough good things about this book. Robin is responsive and active on the Slack channel. If you want to learn React.js, I highly recommend this book. It's up to date and it teaches the latest and adheres to best practices around the React eco-system."*

**[David Martinez Garcia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TVJTUHLPSQDT):***"I'll keep this short and sweet: got this as an ebook as I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer. It proved to be a truly valuable resource. If you really want to learn React in and out, give this title a go, you won't be disappointed. I'm keeping my copy as a go-to reference book as I continue to learn React -- mind you, not an easy topic, but that's what this book is for!"*

**[Scott Edwards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TDR1LGNFGMLT):***"I'm loving this book! I did a Udemy course on React and was confused on a few things. Going through this book, and reading all of the additional links the author recommends, has really clarified things for me. Over and above this, the author provides a very active Slack channel where readers can ask questions on the book's content."*

**[Timothy Myers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R151L9BZ9JH5LJ):***"I've been trying to learn React through video tutorials and it just wasn't cutting it. This book so far has taught me more in a day than I have learned in a month or two of study. And I mean so far I am only about 40 pages in. Can't wait to see what I learn next."*

**[Saul Ocampo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRSYPJA2T340A):***"Robin has a great way of explaining concepts that otherwise were difficult to pick up when I was attempting to learn React. Easy to follow problems and just enough information to get you going building other React applications. Would highly recommend for any user looking to start with React."*

**[Buster](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26ZJX9RM2VLLL):***"This book offers a thorough introduction to the React fundamentals. It also goes through ES6 features that are used in React. Best of all, it receives regular updates as React gets updated, so you're not stuck with outdated material!"*

**[Richard Shea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YD7TLR4V775D):***"'The Road To Learn React' is an excellent book and I fully recommend it to a beginner with React. It's very well structured so that each part progresses naturally from the previous parts. I have read a lot of 'how to' books in the area of javascript and programming generally and I can't think of a better one than this."*

**[Austin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QQQZYH0ALPB3):***"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about building React web apps.
