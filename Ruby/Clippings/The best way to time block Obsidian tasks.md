Obsidian is Morgen's new integration. If you love the flexibility of plain text task management in Obsidian, but want a more robust workflow to better plan and time-block those tasks, this integration is for you.  
  
In this video, long-time Morgen and Obsidian user Danny Hatcher shows how to integrate Obsidian and Morgen to import your tasks alongside your calendars for easy time blocking. He shows you how to configure the integration by choosing which tasks to integrate, how you want to handle task IDs, and more.
