**Christopher Ifekandu Okigbo** (16 August 1932 – 1967) was a Nigerian poet, teacher, and librarian, who died fighting for the independence of [Biafra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biafra "Biafra"). He is today widely acknowledged as an outstanding [postcolonial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism "Postcolonialism") English-language African [poet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet "Poet") and one of the major modernist writers of the 20th century.[^1]

Okigbo was born on 16 August 1932, in the town of [Ojoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ojoto&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ojoto (page does not exist)"), about 10 miles (16 km) from the city of [Onitsha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onitsha "Onitsha") in [Anambra State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anambra_State "Anambra State"), located in the southeastern region of [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria").[^republika-2] His father was a teacher in [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism") [missionary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary "Missionary") schools during the heyday of British colonial rule in [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria"), and Okigbo spent his early years moving from station to station. Despite his father's devout Christianity, Okigbo had an affinity, and came to believe later in his life, that in him was [reincarnated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation") the soul of his maternal grandfather,[^3] a priest of [Idoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Idoto&action=edit&redlink=1 "Idoto (page does not exist)"), an [Igbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_mythology "Igbo mythology") deity. Idoto is personified in the river of the same name that flows through Okigbo's village, and the "water goddess" figures prominently in his work. *Heavensgate* (1962) opens with the lines:

*Before you, mother Idoto,*

*naked I stand,*[^4]

while in "Distances" (1964), he celebrates his final aesthetic and psychic return to his indigenous religious roots:

*I am the sole witness to my homecoming.*[^5]

Another influential figure in Okigbo's early years was his older brother [Pius Okigbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pius_Okigbo "Pius Okigbo"), who would later become the renowned economist and first [Nigerian Ambassador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nigerian_diplomats "List of Nigerian diplomats") to the [European Economic Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Commission "European Economic Commission") (EU).[^6]

## Days at Umuahia and Ibadan

Okigbo graduated from [Government College Umuahia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College_Umuahia "Government College Umuahia") (in present [Abia State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abia_State "Abia State"), southeastern Nigeria) two years after [Chinua Achebe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe "Chinua Achebe"), another noted Nigerian writer, having earned himself a reputation as both a voracious reader and a versatile athlete. The following year, he was accepted to University College in [Ibadan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadan "Ibadan") (now known as [University of Ibadan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ibadan "University of Ibadan")) in [Oyo State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyo_State "Oyo State"), southwestern Nigeria. Originally intending to study Medicine, he switched to Classics in his second year.[^7] In college, he also earned a reputation as a gifted pianist, accompanying [Wole Soyinka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wole_Soyinka "Wole Soyinka") in his first public appearance as a singer. It is believed that Okigbo also wrote original music at that time, though none of this has survived.[^8]

Upon graduating in 1956, he held a succession of jobs in various locations throughout the country, while making his first forays into [poetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"). He worked at the [Nigerian Tobacco Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Tobacco_Company "Nigerian Tobacco Company"), [United Africa Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Africa_Company "United Africa Company"), the Fiditi Grammar School (where he taught Latin), and finally as Assistant Librarian at the [University of Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nigeria "University of Nigeria") in [Nsukka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsukka "Nsukka"), where he helped to found the [African Authors Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=African_Authors_Association&action=edit&redlink=1 "African Authors Association (page does not exist)").[^9]

During those years, he began publishing his work in various journals, notably *[Black Orpheus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Orpheus_\(magazine\) "Black Orpheus (magazine)")*, a literary journal intended to bring together the best works of [African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_literature "African literature") and African-American writers. While his poetry can be read in part as powerful expression of postcolonial [African nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_nationalism "African nationalism"), he was adamantly opposed to [Negritude](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negritude "Negritude"), which he denounced as a romantic pursuit of the "mystique of blackness"[^10] for its own sake; he similarly rejected the conception of a commonality of experience between Africans and black Americans, a stark philosophical contrast to the editorial policy of *Black Orpheus*.[^11] It was on precisely these grounds that he rejected the first prize in African poetry awarded to him at the 1966 [World Festival of Negro Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Festival_of_Negro_Arts "World Festival of Negro Arts") in [Dakar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar "Dakar"), while declaring that there is no such thing as a Negro or black poet.

In 1963, he left Nsukka to assume the position of West African Representative of [Cambridge University Press](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press "Cambridge University Press") at Ibadan, a position affording the opportunity to travel frequently to the [United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), where he attracted further attention. At Ibadan, he became an active member of the [Mbari literary club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbari_Club "Mbari Club"), and completed, composed or published the works of his mature years, including *Limits* (1964), *Silences* (1962–65), *Lament of the Masks* (commemorating the centenary of the birth of [W. B. Yeats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats "W. B. Yeats") in the forms of a [Yoruba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language "Yoruba language") praise poem, 1964), *[Dance of the Painted Maidens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance_of_the_Painted_Maidens&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dance of the Painted Maidens (page does not exist)")* (commemorating the 1964 birth of his daughter, Obiageli or Ibrahimat, whom he regarded as a reincarnation of his mother) and his final highly prophetic sequence, *Path of Thunder* (1965–67), which was published posthumously in 1971 with his magnum opus, *Labyrinths*, which incorporates the poems from the earlier collections.

In 1966, the [Nigerian crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War "Nigerian Civil War") came to a head. Okigbo, living in Ibadan at the time, relocated to eastern Nigeria to await the outcome of the turn of events which culminated in the [secession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession "Secession") of the eastern provinces as independent [Biafra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biafra "Biafra") on 30 May 1967. Living in [Enugu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enugu "Enugu"), he worked together with [Achebe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe "Chinua Achebe") to establish a new publishing house, [Citadel Press](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_Press "Citadel Press").

With the secession of [Biafra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biafra "Biafra"), Okigbo immediately joined the new state's military as a volunteer, field-commissioned major. An accomplished soldier, he was killed in action during a major push by Nigerian troops against Nsukka, the university town where he found his voice as a poet, and which he vowed to defend with his life.[^radio-12]

In July 1967, his hilltop house at Enugu, where several of his unpublished writings (perhaps including the beginnings of a novel) were, was destroyed in a bombing raid by the [Nigerian air force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Air_Force "Nigerian Air Force"). Also destroyed was *Pointed Arches*, an autobiography in verse which he describes in a letter to his friend and biographer, [Sunday Anozie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sunday_Anozie&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sunday Anozie (page does not exist)"), as an account of the experiences of life and letters which conspired to sharpen his creative imagination.[^radio-12]

Several of his unpublished papers are, however, known to have survived the war.[^13] Inherited by his daughter, Obiageli, who established the Christopher Okigbo Foundation in 2005 to perpetuate his legacy, the papers were catalogued in January 2006 by [Chukwuma Azuonye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chukwuma_Azuonye&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chukwuma Azuonye (page does not exist)"), Professor of [African Literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_literature "African literature") at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst "University of Massachusetts Amherst"), Boston, who assisted the foundation in nominating them for The [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") (UNESCO) Memory of the World Register.[^14] Azuonye's preliminary studies of the papers indicate that, apart from new poems in English, including drafts of an Anthem for Biafra, Okigbo's unpublished papers include poems written in [Igbo language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language "Igbo language"). The Igbo poems are fascinating in that they open up new vistas in the study of Okigbo's poetry, countering the views of some critics, especially the troika ([Chinweizu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinweizu "Chinweizu"), Onwuchekwa Jemie and Ihechukwu Madubuike) in their 1980 *Towards the Decolonization of African Literature*, that he sacrificed his indigenous African sensibility in pursuit of obscurantist Euro-modernism.[^15][^16]

"Elegy for Alto", the final poem in *Path of Thunder*, is today widely read as the poet's "last testament" embodying a prophecy of his own death as a sacrificial lamb for human freedom:

*Earth, unbind me; let me be the prodigal; let this be*

*the ram’s ultimate prayer to the tether...*

*AN OLD STAR departs, leaves us here on the shore*

*Gazing heavenward for a new star approaching;*

*The new star appears, foreshadows its going*

*Before a going and coming that goes on forever....*[^17]

The Okigbo Award was established by Wole Soyinka in his honor, in 1987. The first winner was [Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Tati_Loutard "Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard"), for *La Tradition du Songe* (1985).[^18]
