**Leonard Alfred Schneider** (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name **Lenny Bruce**, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, and satirist. He was renowned for his open, free-wheeling, and critical style of comedy that combined satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity.[^2] His 1964 conviction in an [obscenity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity "Obscenity") trial was followed by a [posthumous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumous_recognition "Posthumous recognition") pardon in 2003.[^3]

Bruce forged new paths in comedy and [counterculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture "Counterculture"). His trial for obscenity was a landmark of [freedom of speech in the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States "Freedom of speech in the United States").[^4][^obituary-5][^6] In 2017, *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* magazine ranked Bruce third (behind [Richard Pryor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pryor "Richard Pryor") and [George Carlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin "George Carlin")) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.[^7]

Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider in [Mineola, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineola,_New_York "Mineola, New York"), to a Jewish family.[^8] His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk; they saw each other very infrequently. His mother, [Sally Marr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Marr "Sally Marr") (legal name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg), was a stage performer and dancer[^:0-9] who had an enormous influence on his career.[^10] Bruce grew up in [Bellmore, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellmore,_New_York "Bellmore, New York"), and attended [Wellington C. Mepham High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_C._Mepham_High_School "Wellington C. Mepham High School").[^11] For some of his high school years, he lived at Dengler's Farm on Wantagh Avenue in Wantagh, New York. Bruce's parents divorced before he was 10, and he lived with various relatives over the next decade.

After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the [United States Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") at the age of 16 in 1942, with active service during [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") aboard the [USS *Brooklyn* (CL-40)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Brooklyn_\(CL-40\) "USS Brooklyn (CL-40)") in [Northern Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Africa "Northern Africa"), [Palermo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo "Palermo") in 1943, and [Anzio, Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Shingle "Operation Shingle"), in 1944. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his shipmates in which he was dressed in drag, his commanding officers became upset. He defiantly convinced his ship's medical officer that he was experiencing homosexual urges,[^12] leading to his dishonorable discharge in July 1945. However, he had not admitted to or been found guilty of any breach of naval regulations, and successfully applied to change his discharge to ["Under Honorable Conditions ... by reason of unsuitability for the naval service"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge "Military discharge").[^13]

During the [Korean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War") era, Bruce served in the [United States Merchant Marine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine "United States Merchant Marine"), ferrying troops from the US to Europe and back.[^nyack-14][^santa_monica-15][^encyclopedia.com-16] In 1959, while videotaping the first episode of [Hugh Hefner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hefner "Hugh Hefner")'s *[Playboy's Penthouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy%27s_Penthouse "Playboy's Penthouse")*, Bruce talked about his Navy experience and showed a tattoo he received in [Malta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta "Malta") in 1942.[^17]

After a short period living with his father in California, Bruce settled in New York City, hoping to establish himself as a comedian. However, he found it difficult to differentiate himself from the thousands of other show business hopefuls who populated the city. One place where they congregated was Hanson's, a diner where Bruce met [[Joe Ancis]],[^joe_ancis:_a_brief_biography-18]<sup class="noprint Inline-Template noprint noexcerpt Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="The current source is insufficiently reliable (WP:NOTRS). (November 2023)">better&nbsp;source&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup> who had a profound influence on Bruce's approach to comedy. Many of Bruce's later routines reflected his meticulous schooling at the hands of Ancis.[^19] According to Bruce's biographer [Albert Goldman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Goldman "Albert Goldman"), Ancis's humor involved stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasies and references to jazz.[^20] He also gained notoriety for his focus on controversial subjects, black humour, obscenity, and criticism of organized religion and the establishment.[^:0-9]

Bruce took the stage as "Lenny Marsalle" one evening at the Victory Club as a stand-in master of ceremonies for one of his mother's shows. His ad-libs earned him some laughs. Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and a free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in [Brooklyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn").[^21] He was later a guest—and was introduced by his mother, calling herself Sally Bruce—on the *[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Godfrey%27s_Talent_Scouts "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts")* radio program. Lenny did a piece inspired by [Sid Caesar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Caesar "Sid Caesar"), "The Bavarian Mimic", featuring impressions of American movie stars (e.g., [Humphrey Bogart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart "Humphrey Bogart"), [James Cagney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cagney "James Cagney"), and [Edward G. Robinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson "Edward G. Robinson")).[^22]

Bruce's early comedy career included writing the screenplays for *[Dance Hall Racket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Hall_Racket "Dance Hall Racket")* in 1953, which featured Bruce, his wife [Honey Harlow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Bruce "Honey Bruce"), and mother Sally Marr; *Dream Follies* in 1954, a low-budget burlesque romp; and a children's film, *[The Rocket Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocket_Man_\(1954_film\) "The Rocket Man (1954 film)")*, in 1954. In 1956, [Frank Ray Perilli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ray_Perilli "Frank Ray Perilli"), a fellow nightclub comedian who later wrote two dozen successful films and plays, became Bruce's mentor and part-time manager.[^23] Through Perilli, Bruce met and collaborated with photojournalist William Karl Thomas on three screenplays (*Leather Jacket*, *Killer's Grave* and *The Degenerate*), none of which made it to the screen, and the comedy material on his first three comedy albums.[^24]

Bruce was a roommate of comedian [Buddy Hackett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hackett "Buddy Hackett") in the 1950s. The two appeared on the *[Patrice Munsel Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Patrice_Munsel_Show_\(TV_series\) "The Patrice Munsel Show (TV series)")* (1957–1958), calling their comedy duo the "Not Ready for Prime Time Players",[^wtf-25] 20 years before the [cast of](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_cast_members "Saturday Night Live cast members") *[Saturday Night Live](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live "Saturday Night Live")* used the same name. In 1957, Thomas booked Bruce into the Slate Brothers nightclub, where he was fired the first night for what *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* headlined as "[blue material](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_humor "Blue humor")". This led to the theme of Bruce's first solo album on [Berkeley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California "Berkeley, California")\-based [Fantasy Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Records "Fantasy Records"), *The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce*,[^26] for which Thomas photographed the album cover. Thomas also photographed Bruce's other covers, acted as cinematographer on abortive attempts to film their screenplays, and in 1989 wrote a memoir of their ten-year collaboration, *Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet*.[^27] The 2016 biography of Frank Ray Perilli, *The Candy Butcher*,[^28] devotes a chapter to Perilli's ten-year collaboration with Bruce.

Bruce released four albums of original material on Fantasy Records, later compiled and re-released as *The Lenny Bruce Originals*. Two later records were produced and sold by Bruce himself, including a 10-inch album of the 1961 San Francisco performances that started his legal troubles. Starting in the late 1960s, other unissued Bruce material was released by [Alan Douglas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Douglas_\(record_producer\) "Alan Douglas (record producer)"), [Frank Zappa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa "Frank Zappa") and [Phil Spector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spector "Phil Spector"), as well as Fantasy. Bruce developed the complexity and tone of his material in [Enrico Banducci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Banducci "Enrico Banducci")'s [North Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Beach,_San_Francisco "North Beach, San Francisco") nightclub, the [hungry i](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_i "Hungry i"), where [Mort Sahl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mort_Sahl "Mort Sahl") had earlier made a name for himself.

Branded a "sick comic", Bruce was essentially blacklisted from television, and when he did appear, thanks to sympathetic fans like Hefner and [Steve Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Allen "Steve Allen"), it was with great concessions to [Broadcast Standards and Practices](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Standards_and_Practices "Broadcast Standards and Practices").[^29] Jokes that might offend, like a routine on airplane-[glue-sniffing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant "Inhalant") teenagers that was done live for *[The Steve Allen Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Steve_Allen_Show "The Steve Allen Show")* in 1959, had to be typed out and pre-approved by network officials. On his debut on Allen's show, Bruce made an unscripted comment on the recent marriage of [Elizabeth Taylor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor "Elizabeth Taylor") to [Eddie Fisher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Fisher "Eddie Fisher"), wondering, "Will Elizabeth Taylor become bar mitzvahed?"[^30]

In the midst of a severe blizzard, Bruce gave a famous performance at [Carnegie Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Hall "Carnegie Hall") at midnight on February 4, 1961. It was recorded and later released as the three-disc set *The Carnegie Hall Concert*.[^31]<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="A complete citation is needed. (June 2016)">full citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In his posthumous biography of Bruce, Albert Goldman described that night:[^32]

> It's all a trip—and the best of it is you haven't the faintest idea where you're going! Lenny worshiped the gods of Spontaneity, Candor and Free Association. His greatest fear was getting his act down pat. On this night, he rose to every chance stimulus, every interruption and noise and distraction, with a mad volleying of mental images that suggested the fantastic riches of Charlie Parker's horn. The first flash was simply the spectacle of people piled up in America's most famous concert hall.

In August 1965, a year before his death, Bruce gave his penultimate performance at San Francisco's [Basin Street West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basin_Street_West "Basin Street West"), mainly talking about his legal troubles. The filmed performance was released by Rhino Home Video in 1992 as *The Lenny Bruce Performance Film*.[^33]

Bruce at his arrest in 1961

Bruce's desire to help his wife stop working as a stripper led him to pursue schemes designed to make as much money as possible. The most notable was the Brother Mathias Foundation scam, which resulted in Bruce's arrest in [Miami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami "Miami"), [Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"), in 1951 for impersonating a priest. He was soliciting donations for a [leper colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leper_colony "Leper colony") in [British Guiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Guiana "British Guiana") (now [Guyana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana "Guyana")) under the auspices of the "Brother Mathias Foundation", which he had legally chartered—the name was his own invention, but possibly referred to the actual Brother Matthias who had befriended [Babe Ruth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth "Babe Ruth") at the [Baltimore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore "Baltimore") orphanage where Ruth had been confined as a child.[^45]

While posing as a laundry man, Bruce stole several priests' clergy shirts and a clerical collar. He was acquitted because of the legality of the New York state-chartered foundation, the actual existence of the Guiana leper colony, and the local clergy's inability to expose him as an impostor. Later, in his semifictional autobiography *[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Talk_Dirty_and_Influence_People "How to Talk Dirty and Influence People")*, Bruce said that he had made about $8,000 in three weeks, sending $2,500 to the leper colony and keeping the rest.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity[^46] at the [Jazz Workshop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Workshop "Jazz Workshop") in San Francisco, where he had used the word "cocksucker", and said that "to is a preposition, come is a verb"; that the sexual context of 'come' was so common that it bore no weight; and that if someone hearing it became upset, he "probably can't come".[^linder-47] Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under obscenity charges.

 Bruce in 1963, after being arrested in San Francisco

Bruce was arrested again in 1961 in Philadelphia for drug possession, and again in Los Angeles two years later. The latter arrest took place in then-unincorporated [West Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hollywood,_California "West Hollywood, California"), and the arresting officer was a young deputy named [Sherman Block](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Block "Sherman Block"), who later became county sheriff. The charge this time was that the comedian had used the word "schmuck", an insulting [Yiddish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish "Yiddish") word that was also considered a term for "penis". The Hollywood charges were later dismissed.[^48]

On December 5, 1962, Bruce was arrested on stage at the [Gate of Horn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_of_Horn "Gate of Horn") folk club in Chicago.[^49] That year, he played at [Peter Cook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook "Peter Cook")'s [The Establishment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment_\(club\) "The Establishment (club)") club in London, and in April the next year he was barred from entering the United Kingdom by the [Home Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office "Home Office") as an "undesirable alien".[^50]

In April 1964, he appeared twice at the [Cafe Au Go Go](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Au_Go_Go "Cafe Au Go Go") in [Greenwich Village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village "Greenwich Village"), with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with club owners Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance. On both occasions, Bruce was arrested after leaving the stage.[^linder-47]

A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant District Attorney [Richard Kuh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kuh "Richard Kuh"), with [Ephraim London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_London "Ephraim London") and [Martin Garbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Garbus "Martin Garbus") as the defense attorneys. Bruce and Howard Solomon were found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from—among other artists, writers and educators—[Woody Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen "Woody Allen"), [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan"), [Jules Feiffer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Feiffer "Jules Feiffer"), [Allen Ginsberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg "Allen Ginsberg"), [Norman Mailer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Mailer "Norman Mailer"), [William Styron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Styron "William Styron"), and [James Baldwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin "James Baldwin"), and Manhattan journalist and television personality [Dorothy Kilgallen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Kilgallen "Dorothy Kilgallen") and [sociologist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") [Herbert Gans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_J._Gans "Herbert J. Gans").[^51] Bruce was sentenced on December 21, 1964, to four months in a [workhouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States "Penal labor in the United States"); he was set free on bail during the appeals process and died before the appeal was decided. Solomon, the owner of the club where Lenny was arrested, later saw Bruce's conviction overturned.[^52]

Poster for Bruce's last series of performances, which took place at [The Fillmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fillmore "The Fillmore") in San Francisco on June 24 and 25, 1966

Bruce appeared on network television only six times.[^paley-53] In his later club performances, he was known for relating the details of his encounters with the police directly in his comedy routine. These performances often included rants about his court battles over obscenity charges, tirades against fascism, and complaints that he was being denied his right to freedom of speech. He was banned outright from several U.S. cities.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In September 1962, his only visit to Australia caused a media storm, although he was neither banned nor forced to leave the country. He was booked for a two-week engagement at Aaron's Exchange Hotel, a small pub in central Sydney, by American-born, Australia-based promoter [Lee Gordon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Gordon_\(promoter\) "Lee Gordon (promoter)"), who was by then deeply in debt, nearing the end of his formerly successful career, and desperate to save his business. Bruce's first show at 9 p.m. on September 6 was uneventful, but his second show at 11 p.m. led to major public controversy. Bruce was heckled by audience members, and when local actress [Barbara Wyndon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Wyndon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Barbara Wyndon (page does not exist)") stood up and complained that Bruce was only talking about America and asked him to talk about something different, a clearly annoyed Bruce responded, "Fuck you, madam. That's different, isn't it?" Bruce's remark shocked some audience members and several walked out.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

By the next day, several Sydney papers denounced Bruce as "sick"; one illustrated their story with a retouched photograph appearing to show Bruce giving a [fascist salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_salute "Fascist salute"). The venue owners cancelled the rest of Bruce's performances, and he retreated to his Kings Cross hotel room. Local university students (including future [*OZ*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OZ_\(magazine\) "OZ (magazine)") magazine editor [Richard Neville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Neville_\(writer\) "Richard Neville (writer)")), who were fans of Bruce's humor tried to arrange a performance at the Roundhouse at the [University of New South Wales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales "University of New South Wales"), but at the last minute the university's vice-chancellor rescinded permission to use the venue, with no reason given,[^54] and an interview Bruce was scheduled to give on Australian television was cancelled by the [Australian Broadcasting Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation "Australian Broadcasting Corporation").[^55]

Bruce remained largely confined to his hotel, but eight days later gave his third and last Australian concert at the Wintergarden Theatre in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Although it had a capacity of 2,100, only 200 people attended, including a strong police presence, and Bruce gave what was described as a "subdued" performance. It was long rumored that a tape recording of the historic performance was made by police, but it was in fact recorded by local jazz saxophonist Sid Powell, who brought a portable tape recorder to the show. The tape was rediscovered in 2011 in the possession of Australian singer Sammy Gaha, who had acted as Bruce's chauffeur during his visit; it was subsequently donated to the Lenny Bruce audio collection at [Brandeis University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandeis_University "Brandeis University"). Bruce left the country a few days later and spoke little about the experience.[^56][^57][^58][^59]

Increasing drug use also affected Bruce's health and repeated arrests further caused deterioration to his mental health.[^:0-9] By 1966, he had been blacklisted by nearly every nightclub in the U.S. as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. He gave a famous performance at the [Berkeley Community Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Community_Theatre "Berkeley Community Theatre") in December 1965, which was recorded and became his last live album, *The Berkeley Concert*. The performance has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with Frank Zappa and [The Mothers of Invention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mothers_of_Invention "The Mothers of Invention").[^graham-60] The performance was not remembered fondly by [Bill Graham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Graham_\(promoter\) "Bill Graham (promoter)"), whose memoir describes Bruce as "whacked out on [amphetamine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines "Amphetamines")";[^61] Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed. Zappa asked Bruce to sign his [draft card](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_card "Draft card"), but the suspicious Bruce refused.[^zappa-62]

At the request of Hefner and with the aid of [Paul Krassner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krassner "Paul Krassner"), Bruce wrote an autobiography that was serialized in *[Playboy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy "Playboy")* in 1964 and 1965. It was later published as *How to Talk Dirty and Influence People*.[^watts-63] During this time, Bruce also contributed a number of articles to Krassner's satirical magazine *[The Realist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Realist "The Realist")*.[^64]

On August 3, 1966, Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his [Hollywood Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Hills "Hollywood Hills") home.[^obituary-5] The official photo taken at the scene showed him lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other narcotics paraphernalia. Record producer [Phil Spector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spector "Phil Spector"), a friend of Bruce's, bought the negatives of the photographs "to keep them from the press". The official cause of death was "acute [morphine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine "Morphine") poisoning caused by an overdose".[^:1-44]

Bruce's remains were interred in [Eden Memorial Park Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Memorial_Park_Cemetery "Eden Memorial Park Cemetery") in [Mission Hills, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Hills,_Los_Angeles "Mission Hills, Los Angeles"), but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. Over 500 people came to the service to pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials tried to block the ceremony after ads for it encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. Delivering the eulogy, featured at the end of the documentary *Lenny Bruce: Without Tears*, the Rev. William Glenesk said:

> He was in a sense an evangelist, on a street corner. He was a man—up tight against an artificial world... who shattered its façades, and its hypocrisy, and—if you will pardon the phrase which seems to become a cliche—he saw life as it is.[^65]

Bruce's epitaph reads: "Beloved father—devoted son / Peace at last". [Dick Schaap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Schaap "Dick Schaap") concluded his eulogy to Bruce in *Playboy* with the words: "One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. *That's* obscene". A memorial event was held at the [Judson Memorial Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judson_Memorial_Church "Judson Memorial Church") in New York City on August 12, which was "packed to overflowing" an hour before it was due to get underway. It was attended by prominent members of the arts community, many of whom also performed, and included [Allen Ginsberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg "Allen Ginsberg"), [Joe Lee Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lee_Wilson "Joe Lee Wilson"), [Jean Shepherd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Shepherd "Jean Shepherd"), [Charlie Haden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Haden "Charlie Haden"), and [The Fugs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fugs "The Fugs"); [Paul Krassner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krassner "Paul Krassner") officiated.[^66]

On December 23, 2003, 37 years after Bruce's death, [New York Governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York "Governor of New York") [George Pataki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pataki "George Pataki") granted him a posthumous [pardon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon "Pardon") for his obscenity conviction.[^67][^totn-hentoff-68]

>     Perhaps the most profound and cataclysmic change in our popular culture the last few years—matching the "new sound" in music—has been the kind of humor exemplified by the [Smothers Brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smothers_Brothers "Smothers Brothers"), *[Laugh-In](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh-In "Laugh-In")*, [Woody Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen "Woody Allen"), and that whole breed, whose secret source of strength was the late dark angel, Lenny Bruce.  
>     Bruce was the [Gertrude Stein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Stein "Gertrude Stein") of comedians. Never popular himself—because he was too cryptic and too scatological for popular taste—he nevertheless influenced a whole generation of comics, just as Stein influenced Hemingway and that generation of writers. Her own work was a dead end (so was Bruce's), but out of that compost grew the buds of a flourishing school.

Bruce was the subject of the 1974 biographical drama *[Lenny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_\(film\) "Lenny (film)")*, directed by [Bob Fosse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Fosse "Bob Fosse") and starring [Dustin Hoffman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman "Dustin Hoffman"), who was nominated for a [Best Actor Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor "Academy Award for Best Actor") for the role. It was based on the [Broadway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre "Broadway theatre") stage play of the same name by [Julian Barry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barry "Julian Barry"), which starred [Cliff Gorman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Gorman "Cliff Gorman") in his 1972 [Tony Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award "Tony Award")\-winning role. The main character's editing of a fictionalized film version of *Lenny* was also a major part of Fosse's own autobiopic, the 1979 Academy Award-nominated *[All That Jazz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That_Jazz_\(film\) "All That Jazz (film)")*, where Gorman again played Bruce.

The documentary film *[Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Bruce:_Swear_to_Tell_the_Truth "Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth")* (1998), directed by [Robert B. Weide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_B._Weide "Robert B. Weide") and narrated by [Robert De Niro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro"), was nominated for the [Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature "Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature").

Episode 12 of Season 1 of *Liberty on Trial in America: Cases That Defined Freedom*, aired on January 3, 2020, explored the ways in which Bruce and the First Amendment affected each other.

In 2004, [Comedy Central](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central "Comedy Central") placed Bruce at number three on its list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time, above [Woody Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen "Woody Allen") (4th) and below [Richard Pryor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pryor "Richard Pryor") (1st) and [George Carlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin "George Carlin") (2nd).[^70] Both comedians who ranked higher than Bruce considered him a major influence. Pryor said that hearing Bruce for the first time "changed my life";[^71] while Carlin said that Bruce was a "brilliant comedian" who influenced him as much as a man in his moral thinking and attitudes as he did as a comedian.[^72] Carlin was arrested along with Bruce after refusing to provide identification when police raided a Bruce performance.[^73]
