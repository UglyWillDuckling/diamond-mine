The **century of humiliation** was a period in [Chinese history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_history "Chinese history") beginning with the [First Opium War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War "First Opium War") (1839–1842), and ending in 1945 with China (then the [Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_\(1912-1949\) "Republic of China (1912-1949)")) emerging out of the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") as one of the [Big Four](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Policemen "Four Policemen") and established as a [permanent member](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council") of the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"), or alternatively, ending in 1949 with the [founding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "Founding of the People's Republic of China") of the [People's Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China"). The century-long period is typified by the decline, defeat and political fragmentation of the [Qing dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") and the subsequent Republic of China, which led to demoralizing [foreign intervention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_intervention "Foreign intervention"), [annexation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation "Annexation") and [subjugation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjugation "Subjugation") of China by [Western powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"), [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), and [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>

European powers plan to cut up China for themselves; Germany, Italy, the British Empire, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and France are represented by Wilhelm II Umberto I John Bull Franz Joseph I (in rear), Nicholas II, and Émile Loubet. The United States, represented by Uncle Sam, opposed this, also wanting to retain power in China. Puck Aug 23, 1899, by J. S. Pughe.

The characterization of the period as a "humiliation" arose with an atmosphere of [Chinese nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_nationalism "Chinese nationalism") following China's defeat in the [First Sino-Japanese War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War "First Sino-Japanese War") of 1894-1895 and the subsequent events including the [scramble for concessions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_China "Scramble for China") in the late 1890s. Since then the idea of national humiliation became a focus of discussions among many Chinese writers and scholars, although they differed somewhat in their understandings of national humiliation; ordinary scholars and constitutionalists also had different understanding of their home country from the [anti-Qing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Qing_sentiment "Anti-Qing sentiment") revolutionaries in the late Qing period. The idea of national humiliation was also mentioned in late Qing textbooks.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

After the establishment of the Republic of China, the national humiliation idea grew further in opposition to the [Twenty-One Demands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_Demands "Twenty-One Demands") made by the [Japanese government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_government "Japanese government") in 1915, and with protests against China's poor treatment in the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles") in 1919. Both the [Kuomintang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") and [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") popularized the characterization in the 1920s, protesting the [unequal treaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaties "Unequal treaties") and loss of Chinese territory to foreign colonies. During the 1930s and 1940s, the term became common due to the [Japanese invasion of China *proper*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTECallahan2008210-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Although formal treaty provisions were ended, the epoch remains central to concepts of Chinese nationalism, and the term is widely used in both [political rhetoric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_rhetoric "Political rhetoric") and [popular culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture "Popular culture").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGries200445-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>
