***Camarasaurus*** ([/ ˌ k æ m ər ə ˈ s ɔː r ə s /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [*KAM -ər-ə- SOR -əs*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is a [genus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus "Genus") of [sauropod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda "Sauropoda") [dinosaur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur "Dinosaur") that lived in [North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentia "Laurentia") during the [Late Jurassic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Jurassic "Late Jurassic") [period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale "Geologic time scale"). Its fossil remains have been found in the [Morrison Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Formation "Morrison Formation"), dating to the [Kimmeridgian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimmeridgian "Kimmeridgian") and [Tithonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonian "Tithonian") ages of the [Jurassic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic "Jurassic"), between 155 and 145 million years ago (mya).

*Camarasaurus* presented a distinctive cranial profile of a blunt snout and an arched skull that was remarkably square, typical of basal [macronarians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macronaria "Macronaria").

The [generic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus "Genus") name means "chambered lizard", referring to the hollow chambers, known as [pleurocoels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurocoel "Pleurocoel"), in its cervical [vertebrae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrae "Vertebrae") ([Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") καμαρα (**kamara**) meaning "vaulted chamber", or anything with an arched cover, and σαυρος (**sauros**) meaning "lizard").

*Camarasaurus* contains four species that are commonly recognized as valid: *[Camarasaurus grandis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_grandis "Camarasaurus grandis")*, *[Camarasaurus lentus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_lentus "Camarasaurus lentus")*, *[Camarasaurus lewisi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_lewisi "Camarasaurus lewisi")*, and *[Camarasaurus supremus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_supremus "Camarasaurus supremus")*. *C. supremus*, the [type species](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species "Type species"), is the largest and geologically youngest of the four. *Camarasaurus* is the type genus of [Camarasauridae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasauridae "Camarasauridae"), which also includes its European close relative *[Lourinhasaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourinhasaurus "Lourinhasaurus")*.

*Camarasaurus* was named in 1877 by [Edward Drinker Cope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Drinker_Cope "Edward Drinker Cope"), during the period of scientific rivalry between him and [Othniel Charles Marsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othniel_Charles_Marsh "Othniel Charles Marsh") known as the [Bone Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Wars "Bone Wars"). Soon after, Marsh named a genus *Morosaurus*, but it was subsequently shown to be synonymous with *Camarasaurus*.

# history 

The first record of *Camarasaurus* comes from the spring of 1877 when Mr. Oramel William Lucas of [Cañon City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C3%B1on_City,_Colorado "Cañon City, Colorado"), Colorado discovered some large vertebrae at [Garden Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Park,_Colorado "Garden Park, Colorado"), which he sent to [Edward Drinker Cope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Drinker_Cope "Edward Drinker Cope") who was based in [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia").[^1] The original material sent consisted of a partial cervical vertebra, which would become the taxon's namesake, three dorsal vertebrae, and four caudal vertebrae.[^2] [^1] This specimen is now thought to have been composed of several individuals.[^2] From these initial fragmentary remains, Cope made his original description of *Camarasaurus supremus* (“supreme chambered lizard”) and founded the genus; these remains are now in the [American Museum of Natural History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History "American Museum of Natural History") under the catalogue number AMNH 560.[^2] After receiving the original bones, Cope employed collectors who gathered more of the material which was described in 1921 by [Henry Osborn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fairfield_Osborn "Henry Fairfield Osborn") and Charles Mook.[^2]

The earliest known skeletal reconstruction of a sauropod dinosaur: *C. supremus* by John A. Ryder, 1877

The amount of material was great, it composed of several jumbled partial skeletons.[^2] It was not all prepared at once, but a considerable amount of it was cleaned up by Jacob Geismar under Cope's direction throughout the 1870s to 1890s.[^2] In 1877 a reconstruction of the skeleton of *Camarasaurus* was painted by Dr. John Ryder on several canvasses, under the direction of Professor Cope who would use them in lectures to impress his audience.[^2] This reconstruction would be the first ever made of a sauropod dinosaur, was natural size and represented the remains of a number of individuals. The reconstruction was over fifty feet in length. Cope's collectors sent in more material from 1877 to 1878,[^2] [^3] and as Cope would get more material, he would name taxa based on these newly sent remains. Most of these additional taxa are now considered dubious or synonymous with *Camarasaurus*.[^3] By the end of collecting in Garden Park, at least four individuals and several hundred bones had been found from nearly every part of the skeleton.[^2]

Mounted skeletal cast at the [Jurassic Museum of Asturias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Museum_of_Asturias "Jurassic Museum of Asturias")

The next *Camarasaurus* discovery came later in 1877, when a fragmentary posterior skull and a partial postcranial skeleton was discovered and collected in Quarry 1, [Como Bluff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como_Bluff "Como Bluff"), Wyoming by crews working for [Othniel Charles Marsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othniel_Charles_Marsh "Othniel Charles Marsh"). This skeleton would be the best preserved single individual of *Camarasaurus* at the time, and it was named as a new species of *[Apatosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatosaurus "Apatosaurus")* in 1877. The specimen was not fully collected until 1879 and the specimen contains the majority of a juvenile's skeleton (holotype YPM 1901) [^4] Meanwhile, crews working for Edward Cope in Garden Park, collected a fragmentary specimen consisting of a femur and 2 caudal vertebrae was made a new species of *[Amphicoelias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphicoelias "Amphicoelias")* by Cope which he named *Amphicoelias latus* in 1877.[^5] This species was tentatively synonymized with *C. supremus* in 1921. In 1998, Kenneth Carpenter argued that the stratigraphic position of the find suggested it was more likely to be synonymous with *C. grandis*,[^6] but in a 2005 study of the biostratigraphic distribution of *Camarasaurus*, Takehito Ikejiri retained it in synonymy with *C. supremus*.[^7] In 1878, a sauropod sacrum was discovered with several other jumbled sauropod postcranial elements, again at Como Bluff. The remains were also sent to Marsh and in 1878 the sacrum was assigned to a new genus and species, *Morosaurus impar* ("unpaired stupid lizard"). *Morosaurus* would receive several new species throughout the late 19th century, even becoming part of a new family in 1892, the [Morosauridae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morosauridae "Morosauridae"). A majority of *Morosaurus* species are now considered dubious,[^8] including the type species, or reclassified.[^8] In 1889, a new species of *Morosaurus* was named based on a partial skull and skeleton from Como Bluff. *Morosaurus lentus* was the name given to the skeleton (holotype YPM 1910) [^7] and the skeleton was mounted in the [Yale Peabody Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History "Peabody Museum of Natural History") fossil hall in 1930.

Skull of *Camarasaurus* sp. AMNH 467 at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History "American Museum of Natural History").

In the late 1890s, the [American Museum of Natural History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History "American Museum of Natural History") and the [Field Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Museum_of_Natural_History "Field Museum of Natural History") found additional *Morosaurus* material at [Como Bluff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como_Bluff "Como Bluff") and [Fruita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruita,_Colorado "Fruita, Colorado") respectively. Mostly consisting of limb material, the new *Morosaurus* material led to new reconstructions of [sauropod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropod "Sauropod") manus and pes structure.[^9] [^10] The AMNH made an important discovery in 1899 at their [Bone Cabin Quarry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Cabin_Quarry "Bone Cabin Quarry") in Wyoming with the discovery of the first complete *Camarasaurus* skull and mandible with associated cervical vertebrae.[^11] Major reassessment of *Morosaurus* and *Camarasaurus* came in 1901, a reassessment by [Elmer Riggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_S._Riggs "Elmer S. Riggs") concluded that of the five *Morosaurus* species named by Marsh, only three were valid.[^10] *Morosaurus grandis*, *Morosaurus lentus*, and *Morosaurus agilis* (now known as *[Smitanosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smitanosaurus "Smitanosaurus")*) were accepted as valid, with *Morosaurus impar* synonymous with *M. grandis*. Possible synonymy between *Morosaurus* and *Camarasaurus* was also suggested by Riggs.[^10] In 1905, the first mounted skeleton of a sauropod was mounted at the AMNH of a *Brontosaurus*, the skull of the mount was notoriously based on material that was likely from a *Camarasaurus* from Como Bluff.[^12]

The Carnegie Museum had an important *Camarasaurus* discovery in 1909 of a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile, now under specimen number CM 11338. The specimen was notably found articulated in a death pose and is prominently displayed at the Carnegie Museum hall.[^13] Earl Douglass discovered the specimen and it was collected from 1909 to 1910 by Carnegie Museum crew working at [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument "Dinosaur National Monument"). This skeleton was not described until 1925 by [Charles W. Gilmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_W._Gilmore "Charles W. Gilmore") This specimen was referred to *Camarasaurus lentus*. The skeleton is one of the best sauropod specimens known, with almost every element preserved in articulation including the fragile cervical vertebrae.[^13]

Another *Camarasaurus* skeleton was found in 1918, again at [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument "Dinosaur National Monument") by Carnegie crews, this specimen can be viewed at the [National Museum of Natural History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History "National Museum of Natural History"). The specimen, known as USNM V 13786, was traded to the USNM in 1935 and prep work started on the specimen in 1936 at the [Texas Centennial Exposition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Centennial_Exposition "Texas Centennial Exposition") in [Dallas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas "Dallas") where it could be viewed by visitors of the event.[^14] Preparation work would continue until 1947 when the skeleton was mounted in a death pose in the fossil hall.[^14] The USNM's *Camarasaurus* was also referred to *C. lentus*.[^15] [^7]

In 1919, W. J. Holland would name *Uintasaurus douglassi* based another sauropod specimen from DNM that was discovered by the Carnegie Museum in 1909.[^16] The type specimen was incomplete, consisting of 5 anterior cervical vertebrae,[^16] and is a synonym of *Camarasaurus lentus*.[^7] Additional *Camarasaurus* material was found at near Black Mesa in western Oklahoma during the 1940s [^17] and has been referred to *Camarasaurus supremus* [^7]*,* the material consists of many large vertebrae and some skull elements.[^7]

Mounted skeleton of *Camarasaurus* sp. SMA 0002 at the [Sauriermuseum Aathal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aathal_Dinosaur_Museum "Aathal Dinosaur Museum").

No major discoveries would come for *Camarasaurus* until in 1967, [James Jensen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Jensen "James A. Jensen") collected a well preserved and articulated partial postcranial skeleton, including majority of the vertebral column, at [Uncompahgre Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_Mesa_Quarry "Dry Mesa Quarry") in western [Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado") [^18] [^19] and was deposited at [Brigham Young University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University "Brigham Young University") under specimen number BYU 9740.[^20] [^18] The skeleton wasn't full prepared until years later,[^18] and was described in 1988 as a new genus and species of [Camarasaurid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasauridae "Camarasauridae"), *[Cathetosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathetosaurus "Cathetosaurus") lewisi*.[^19] *C. lewisi* ' s original description was brief, but later in 1996 the skeleton was given a full osteology and placed as a species of *Camarasaurus* by John McIntosh and colleagues. In their paper, they determined that *C. supremus, C. grandis, C. lentus,* and *C. lewisi* were valid.[^18] In 2013, Octavio Mateus and Emanuel Tschopp argued that *C. lewisi* was actually its own genus based on a specimen found at Howe Quarry in 1992 [^21] that they referred to the species.[^22] Further research by Tschopp concluded that the Howe Quarry specimen was most likely to represent *Camarasaurus* after all.[^23] As of 2019, most researchers considered *C. lewisi* to be a species of *Camarasaurus*.[^24]

In 1992, another substantial and articulated skeleton of *Camarasaurus* was collected, this skeleton by Jeffrie Parker and colleagues near the AMNH's [Bone Cabin Quarry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Cabin_Quarry "Bone Cabin Quarry") at Como Bluff.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcIntoshMilesClowardParker19961%E2%80%935-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> This skeleton was referred to *Camarasaurus grandis* [^26] and is one of the most complete specimens assigned to the species, it now resides at the [Gunma Museum of Natural History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunma_Museum_of_Natural_History "Gunma Museum of Natural History") in Tokyo under specimen number GMNH-PV 101.[^27] [^7] 1992 saw yet another *Camarasaurus* skeleton discovery further north at [Howe Quarry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Howe_Quarry&action=edit&redlink=1 "Howe Quarry (page does not exist)"), Wyoming by crews working for the [Sauriermuseum Aathal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aathal_Dinosaur_Museum "Aathal Dinosaur Museum") in Switzerland. The skeleton is one of the best known, with nearly every element articulated and skin impressions from the skull and hindlimb.[^28] [^21] The specimen, SMA 002, has not yet gotten a full identification, but has been suggested to be a specimen of *C. lewisi*.[^21] In 1996, several fragmentary remains of *Camarasaurus* were described from western [South Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota "South Dakota") [^29] and [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"),[^30] extending the northeastern and southern range of the genus, with the New Mexican remains from the [Summerville Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerville_Formation "Summerville Formation").[^30] The northernmost specimen of *Camarasaurus* was discovered in 2005 in the Snowy Mountains region of central Montana and consists of a nearly complete skull and several postcranial elements.[^15]

CM 11338, the most complete known *Camarasaurus* specimen

*Camarasaurus* fossils are very common.[^31] Over 500 specimens are known, including many isolated bones and about 50 partial skeletons.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoodruffFoster201752%E2%80%9353-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> It is found in a wide area over the western United States, from as far north as [[Montana]] to as far south as [[New Mexico]], in rocks of the [Morrison Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Formation "Morrison Formation").[^33] Due to this abundance, *Camarasaurus* is a very well-known sauropod. A juvenile specimen of *Camarasaurus*, CM 11338, is the most complete sauropod skeleton ever discovered. Numerous skulls are known.[^34] Even though complete necks are rarely found in sauropods, five specimens of *Camarasaurus* preserve all or nearly all of the cervical vertebrae.[^35] Most identifiable specimens of *Camarasaurus* belong to one of two species, *C. grandis* and *C. lentus*; *C. lewisi* and *C. supremus* are rarer.[^36]

Restoration of a *C. supremus* herd

*Camarasaurus* is among the most common and frequently well-preserved sauropod dinosaurs uncovered and has been well described in numerous publications.[^21] [^13] [^2] Similar to other macronarians, it had the typical large naris, long forelimbs, and short tail compared to the contemporary diplodocids.[^2] [^37] *Camarasaurus* was a medium-sized sauropod compared to contemporary species in the same formation, but in the [Tithonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonian "Tithonian") reached large sizes with *C. supremus*.[^7] [^2] The maximum size of the most common species, *C. lentus*, was about 15 m (49 ft) in length. The largest species, *C. supremus*, reached a maximum length of 18-23 meters (59-75 ft) and a maximum estimated weight of 47  [metric tons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_ton "Metric ton") (51.8  [tons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton "Short ton")).[^38] In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated its weight at 23 [metric tons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_ton "Metric ton") (25.4  [tons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton "Short ton")),[^39] whereas in 2020, John Foster estimated its weight at 42.3 [metric tons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_ton "Metric ton") (46.6  [tons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton "Short ton")).[^31]

The arched [skull](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull "Skull") of *Camarasaurus* was remarkably square and the blunt snout had many [fenestrae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull#fenestrae "Skull"). The robust skull of *Camarasaurus* preserves much better than many other sauropods, unlike the gracile skulls of [diplodocids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplodocidae "Diplodocidae") that are also found in the Morrison Formation.[^37] The 19-cm-long (7.5-in) [teeth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth "Tooth") were shaped like [chisels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisel "Chisel") (spatulate) and arranged evenly along the jaw. The strength of the teeth indicates that *Camarasaurus* probably ate coarser plant material than the slender-toothed diplodocids.

A specimen of *Camarasaurus* called SMA 0002 (which has also been assigned to *[Cathetosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathetosaurus "Cathetosaurus")*) from Wyoming's Howe-Stephens Quarry, referred to as "E.T.", shows evidence of soft tissue.[^21] Along the jaw line, ossified remains of what appear to have been the animal's gums have been recovered, indicating that it had deep-set teeth covered by gums, with only the tips of the crowns protruding. The teeth were, upon death, pushed further out from their sockets as the gums retracted, dried, and tightened through decay. The examinations of the specimen also indicate that the teeth were covered by tough outer scales and possibly a beak of some variety, though this is not known for certain.[^21]

The neck of *Camarasaurus* was of only moderate length by sauropod standards. It was composed of 12 vertebrae.[^40] Most of the cervical neural spines were bifurcated, with more vertebrae developing bifurcated neural spines as the animal grew.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWedelTaylor201311%E2%80%9312-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> As in other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck and torso contained chambers that in life were filled by air sacs connected to the [respiratory system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system "Respiratory system"). The air sacs could take up more than half of the space inside the vertebrae, making them as highly [pneumatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_pneumaticity "Skeletal pneumaticity") as the bones of birds.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorWedel201314%E2%80%9315-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> It is these chambers that give *Camarasaurus* its name, "chambered lizard".

The tail of *Camarasaurus* was composed of 53 vertebrae.[^40] [^43]

*Camarasaurus* is the type genus of the family [Camarasauridae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasauridae "Camarasauridae"), members of which are medium-sized [Macronarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macronaria "Macronaria") sauropods that mostly date to the [Late Jurassic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Jurassic "Late Jurassic"). Camarasaurids had shorter hindlimbs than forelimbs, large scapulocoracoids, and longer tails than necks.[^44] [^2] When Edward Cope described *Camarasaurus* in 1877, he believed it was a dinosaur closely related to *[Cetiosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetiosaurus "Cetiosaurus"), [Bothriospondylus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothriospondylus "Bothriospondylus"), [Ornithopsis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopsis "Ornithopsis"), [Anchisaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchisaurus "Anchisaurus")* (*Megadactylus*), and *Pneumatosteus*,[^1] but didn’t name a group for these taxa until the description of *Amphicoelias* when he erected Camarasauridae.[^5] *Camarasaurus* is the only taxon uncontroversially regarded as a valid genus of camarasaurid. It contains four species: *[C. grandis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_grandis "Camarasaurus grandis")*, *[C. lentus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_lentus "Camarasaurus lentus")*, *[C. lewisi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_lewisi "Camarasaurus lewisi")*, and *[C. supremus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_supremus "Camarasaurus supremus")*. *C. lewisi* may represent a distinct genus, *Cathetosaurus*. *[Lourinhasaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourinhasaurus "Lourinhasaurus")*, the type species of which was formerly assigned to *Camarasaurus*, is regarded as a camarasaurid by most studies, though it has also been considered to be a basal eusauropod.[^45] [^46]

A simplified cladogram of basal Macronaria after Tan et al (2020) is shown below:

<table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusauropoda">Eusauropoda</a></td><td rowspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

*Camarasaurus* is considered to be a [basal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_\(phylogenetics\) "Basal (phylogenetics)") macronarian, more closely related to the common ancestor of all macronarians than to more [derived](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_\(phylogenetics\) "Primitive (phylogenetics)") forms like *[Brachiosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiosaurus "Brachiosaurus")*.

*Camarasaurus* is regarded as containing four valid species by most researchers: *C. grandis*, *C. lentus*, *C. lewisi*, and *C. supremus*.[^24] *C. supremus*, the species named by Cope in 1877, is the [type species](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species "Type species"). *C. grandis* was named in 1877 and *C. lentus* in 1889. The fourth species, *[C. lewisi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus_lewisi "Camarasaurus lewisi")*, is of uncertain affinities. It was originally described as a distinct genus, *Cathetosaurus*, in 1988, but reclassified as a species of *Camarasaurus* in 1996.[^47] [^48] Some researchers have suggested that *Cathetosaurus* should be reinstated as a distinct genus,[^22] [^49] [^24] whereas others have suggested that *C. lewisi* may be synonymous with another *Camarasaurus* species.[^7] <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoodruffFoster201750%E2%80%9351-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup>

*Camarasaurus supremus* vertebrae at Quarry 1 in Garden Park c. 1878

*C. supremus*, as its name suggests, is the largest known species of *Camarasaurus* [^2] and one of the most massive sauropods known from the late Jurassic [Morrison Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Formation "Morrison Formation"). Except for its huge size, it was nearly indistinguishable from *C. lentus*. *C. supremus* was not typical of the genus as a whole, and is known only from the latest, uppermost parts of the formation and is extremely uncommon.[^7] Both *C. grandis,**C. lentus,* and *C. lewisi* were smaller, as well as occurring in the earlier stages of the Morrison.

Multiview skeletal reconstruction of *C. supremus*.

Stratigraphic evidence suggests that chronological sequence aligned with the physical differences between the three species, and it describes an evolutionary progression within the Morrison Formation. *C. grandis* is the oldest species and occurred in the lowest rock layers of the Morrison. *C. lewisi* only briefly coexisted with *C. grandis* in the lowest strata of the upper Morrison until going extinct,[^7] but it is possible this is because of a lack of specimens from *C. lewisi*.[^7] *C. lentus* appeared later, co-existing with *C. grandis* for several million years, possibly due to different ecological niches as suggested by differences in the spinal anatomy of the two species. At a later stage, *C. grandis* disappeared from the rock record, leaving only *C. lentus*.[^7] Then *C. lentus*, too, disappeared; at the same time, *C. supremus* appeared in the uppermost layers. This immediate succession of species, as well as the very close similarity between the two, suggests that *C. supremus* may have evolved directly from *C. lentus*, representing a larger, later-surviving population of animals.[^51]

Teeth from the *Caulodon diversidens* holotype.

- *Amphicoelias latus* was named by Edward Cope in 1877 [^52] based on a right femur and 4 caudal vertebrae found at Garden Park and is synonymous with either *C. supremus* or *C. grandis*.[^6] [^7]
- *Caulodon diversidens* was also named by Cope in 1877 on, now dubious, teeth that can only be placed as a Macronarian or as synonymous with *Camarasaurus supremus*.[^20] [^7] [^2]
- *Caulodon leptoganus* was named in 1878 by Cope on 2 partial teeth and is also considered to be unclassifiable beyond Macronaria or as synonymous with *Camarasaurus supremus*.[^20] [^7] [^2]
- *Morosaurus impar* was named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of *Morosaurus*, and the material consisted only of a sacrum and possibly additional postcranial material found at [Como Bluff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como_Bluff "Como Bluff"). It is now considered a synonym of *C. grandis.*[^7]
- *Morosaurus robustus* was named on the basis of an ilium by Marsh in 1878 collected at Como Bluff. It is now considered a synonym of *C. grandis*.[^7] [^20]
- *Camarasaurus leptodirus* was another one of Cope's Garden Park sauropods and was named in 1879 on 3 partial cervical vertebrae, it has been suggested to be a synonym of *C. supremus*.[^7] [^20]
- *Diplodocus lacustris* was named by [Othniel Marsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othniel_Charles_Marsh "Othniel Charles Marsh") in 1884 on the basis of several teeth, a premaxilla, and a maxilla from [Morrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison,_Colorado "Morrison, Colorado"), Colorado that were collected by [Arthur Lakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Lakes "Arthur Lakes") and [Benjamin Mudge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Mudge "Benjamin Franklin Mudge") in 1877.[^53] Although the teeth and dentary of *D. lacustris* are [Flagellicaudatan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellicaudata "Flagellicaudata"), the skull material is likely that of a *Camarasaurus*.[^53]
- *Pleurocoelus montanus* was also named by Marsh in 1896 as a new species of *[Pleurocoelus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodon "Astrodon")*, the material consisting of several vertebral centra and assorted postcrania of a juvenile individual from Como Bluff. It is generally regarded as a synonym of *C. grandis.*[^7] [^20]
- *Uintasaurus douglassi* was named in 1919 by W. J. Holland for 5 anterior cervical vertebrae from Dinosaur National Monument,[^16] the species was later regarded as a synonym of *Camarasaurus lentus*.[^7]
- *Camarasaurus annae* was named by Tage Ellinger based on an anterior dorsal vertebra in 1950. This species is generally considered a synonym of *C.lentus.*[^7]
- *Morosaurus agilis* was named in 1889 by Marsh based on a partial skull and 3 vertebrae from Garden Park, Colorado.[^54] The species remained in taxonomic uncertainty until in 2020, it was placed in a new genus, *[Smitanosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smitanosaurus "Smitanosaurus")*, and reclassified as a [dicraeosaurid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicraeosauridae "Dicraeosauridae").[^8]
- *Camarasaurus becklesiii* was described as *Pelorosaurus becklesii* in 1842 by [Gideon Mantell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Mantell "Gideon Mantell") based on a partial forelimb from [Sussex, United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex "Sussex"). It was placed in *Morosaurus* by Marsh in 1889 [^55] and *Camarasaurus* by [von Huene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_von_Huene "Friedrich von Huene") in 1932 [^56] until in 2015, it was placed in its own genus, *[Haestasaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haestasaurus "Haestasaurus")*.[^57]
- *Morosaurus marchei* was named by Sauvage in 1898 based on an incomplete distal caudal vertebra and tooth from the Upper Jurassic strata of the [Alcobaca Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoba%C3%A7a_Formation "Alcobaça Formation") of Portugal.[^58] Lapparent & Zbyszewski referred the holotype [^59] vertebra to *[Megalosaurus insignis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalosaurus "Megalosaurus")* and Madsen *et al*., 1995 referred it to [Megalosauria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalosauroidea "Megalosauroidea").[^60] The referred tooth was identified as belonging to [Turiasauria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turiasauria "Turiasauria") in 2017.[^61]
- *Camarasaurus alenquerensis* was named as a species of *Apatosaurus* in 1957 by [Albert-Félix de Lapparent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-F%C3%A9lix_de_Lapparent "Albert-Félix de Lapparent") and Georges Zbyweski on a partial postcranial skeleton from [Lourinha, Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourinh%C3%A3_Formation "Lourinhã Formation").[^62] It was placed in *Camarasaurus* by John McIntosh in 1990,[^63] but was granted a new genus in 1998, *[Lourinhasaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourinhasaurus "Lourinhasaurus")*.

*C. lentus* skull

Previously, scientists have suggested that *Camarasaurus* and other sauropods may have swallowed [gastroliths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrolith "Gastrolith") (stones) to help grind the food in the stomach, regurgitating or passing them when they became too smooth. More recent analysis, however, of the evidence for stomach stones suggests this was not the case. The strong, robust teeth of *Camarasaurus* were more developed than those of most sauropods and were replaced on average every 62 days (M. D'Emic et al.), indicating that *Camarasaurus* may have [masticated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masticate "Masticate") food in its mouth to some degree before swallowing.[^64] Other findings indicate that *Camarasaurus* spp. preferred vegetation different from other sauropods, allowing them to share the same environment without competing.[^65]

Long-bone [histology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology "Histology") enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Griebeler *et al.* (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded that the *Camarasaurus* sp. **CM 36664** weighed 14,247 kilograms (15.7 short tons), reached sexual maturity at 20 years and died at age 26.[^66]

Eagle *et al.* performed [clumped isotope thermometry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clumped_isotopes "Clumped isotopes") on the enamel covering the teeth of various Jurassic sauropods, including *Camarasaurus*. Temperatures of 32.4–36.9 °C (90.3–98.4 °F) were obtained, which is comparable to that of modern mammals.[^67] *Camarasaurus* grew in size quickly to limit the time it would be vulnerable to predation. This would imply it had a relatively high metabolic rate as a juvenile.[^68]

A *Camarasaurus* pelvis recovered from [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument "Dinosaur National Monument") in Utah shows gouging attributed to *[Allosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosaurus "Allosaurus")* [^69] and on the ilium of the *C. lewisi* holotype there are large Theropod bite marks.[^20]

In 1992, a partial *C. grandis* skeleton was discovered at the [Bryan Small Stegosaurus Quarry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Small_Stegosaurus_Quarry "Bryan Small Stegosaurus Quarry") of the Morrison Formation near [Cañon City, Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_City,_Colorado "Canon City, Colorado").[^70] This specimen preserved a partial right humerus cataloged as DMNH 2908 and associated vertebrae from the back and tail.[^70] In 2001, Lorie McWhinney, Kenneth Carpenter, and Bruce Rothschild published a description of a pathology observed on the humerus.[^71] They noted a [juxtacortical lesion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juxtacortical_lesion&action=edit&redlink=1 "Juxtacortical lesion (page does not exist)") 25 by 18 cm wide made of bone that resembled woven fibers.[^72] Although [woven bone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woven_bone "Woven bone") forms in accessory dental bone, in other locations, it is a sign of injury or illness.[^72] The woven bone's "undulating fibrous bundles" were observed oriented in the direction of the *m. brachialis*.[^72] The lesion's [fusion](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fusion "wikt:fusion") and lack of [porosity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity "Porosity") at its near and far ends indicate the periostitis was inactive or healed.[^72] McWhinney and the other researchers argued that this injury would have been a continuous source of hardship for the animal.[^73] It would have exerted pressure on the muscles.[^71] This pressure would have compressed the muscles' blood vessels and nerves, reducing the range of motion of both the limb's [flexor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor "Flexor") and [extensor muscles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_muscles "Extensor muscles").[^71] This effect would have hindered the *[M. brachialis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachialis_muscle "Brachialis muscle")*, *[m. brachoradialis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._brachoradialis "M. brachoradialis")*, and to a lesser degree the *[m. biceps brachii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._biceps_brachii "M. biceps brachii")* to the lesion's position on the humerus.[^71] The researchers inferred that the inflammation of the muscles and [periosteum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum "Periosteum") would have caused additional complications in the lower region of the fore limb, as well.[^74] The lesion would also have caused long-term [fasciitis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciitis "Fasciitis") and [myosistis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosistis "Myosistis").[^71] The cumulative effect of these pathological processes would have moderate to severe effects on the ability of the limb to move and "made everyday activities such as foraging for food and escaping predators harder to accomplish." [^73] To help determine the cause of the pathology, McWhinney and the other researchers performed a [CT scan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan "CT scan") in 3-mm increments.[^75] The CT scan found that the mass had a consistent [radiodensity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity "Radiodensity") and was separated from the cortex of the bone by a [radiolucent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolucent "Radiolucent") line.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcWhinneyCarpenterRothschild2001370%E2%80%93371-76"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> No evidence was found of stress fracture or infectious processes like osteomyelitis or infectious periostitis.[^75] They also ruled out [osteochondroma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondroma "Osteochondroma") because the axis of the spur is 25° relative to the vertical axis of the humerus, whereas an osteochondroma would have formed at 90° to the axis of the humerus.[^72] Other candidates identified by the scientists for the origin of the spur-bearing lesion included:

1. [Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_osteoarthropathy "Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy") – although this was ruled out by the presence of the spur-like process.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcWhinneyCarpenterRothschild2001372%E2%80%93373-77"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup>
2. [Osteoid osteoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoid_osteoma "Osteoid osteoma") – but this would not explain the spur or [osteoblastic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblastic "Osteoblastic") reaction.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcWhinneyCarpenterRothschild2001373%E2%80%93374-78"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup>
3. [Shin splints](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_splints "Shin splints") or [tibial stress syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibial_stress_syndrome "Tibial stress syndrome") – a possible origin, as many symptoms would be held in common, but shin splints would not explain the spur.[^79]
4. [Myositis ossificans traumatica (circumscripta)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis_ossificans_traumatica_\(circumscripta\) "Myositis ossificans traumatica (circumscripta)") – possible, but unlikely source.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcWhinneyCarpenterRothschild2001374%E2%80%93375-80"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup>
5. [Avulsion injury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_injury "Avulsion injury") – McWhinney and the other researchers considered an avulsion injury caused by "repetitive overexertion of the muscles" to be the most likely source for the lesion on the humerus.[^71] The researchers believed the lesion to have originated with the avulsion of the *m. brachialis* causing the formation of "a downward-sloping elliptical mass".[^73] The bone spur was caused by an osteoblastic response following a tear at the base of the *m. brachioradialis* caused by its flexor motion.[^73]

Skull in mudstone matrix, [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument "Dinosaur National Monument")

The Morrison Formation, situated along the eastern flank of the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains"), is home to a fossil-rich stretch of [Late Jurassic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Jurassic "Late Jurassic") rock. A large number of dinosaur species can be found here, including relatives of *Camarasaurus* such as *[Diplodocus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplodocus "Diplodocus")*, *[Apatosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatosaurus "Apatosaurus")*, and *[Brachiosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiosaurus "Brachiosaurus")*, but camarasaurs are the most abundant of the dinosaurs in the formation.[^81] *Camarasaurus* fossils have been found in almost every major locality and have one of the greatest known distributions of Morrison dinosaurs, with fossils found in localities from New Mexico to Montana and Utah to Oklahoma.[^7] According to [radiometric dating](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating "Radiometric dating"), the Morrison sedimentary layers range between 156.3 million years ago (Mya) at the base, to 146.8 Mya at the top, which places it in the late [Oxfordian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordian_stage "Oxfordian stage"), [Kimmeridgian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimmeridgian "Kimmeridgian"), and early [Tithonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonian "Tithonian") [stages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faunal_stages "Faunal stages") of the Late Jurassic period.[^82] [^83] Its environment is interpreted as [semiarid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiarid "Semiarid") with distinct [wet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season "Wet season") and [dry seasons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season "Dry season").

Dinosaur and [trace fossils](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_fossils "Trace fossils") are found particularly in the Morrison Basin, which stretches from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. Eroded material from their east-facing [drainage basins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin "Drainage basin") was carried by streams and [rivers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River") and deposited in [swampy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") lowlands, lakes, river channels, and [floodplains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floodplain "Floodplain").[^84] The formation is similar in age to the [Lourinha Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourinh%C3%A3_Formation "Lourinhã Formation") in [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") and the [Cañadón Calcáreo Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C3%B1ad%C3%B3n_Calc%C3%A1reo_Formation "Cañadón Calcáreo Formation") in Argentina, [Camarasaurid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasauridae "Camarasauridae") fossils have been found at the 2 formations.[^62] [^85] In 1877, it became the center of the [Bone Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Wars "Bone Wars"), a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists [Othniel Charles Marsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othniel_Charles_Marsh "Othniel Charles Marsh") and [Edward Drinker Cope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Drinker_Cope "Edward Drinker Cope"), with *Camarasaurus* itself being discovered and named by the latter Paleontologist during the conflict.

The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as *[Maraapunisaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barosaurus "Barosaurus")*, *[Amphicoelias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphicoelias "Amphicoelias"), [Barosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barosaurus "Barosaurus"),**[Diplodocus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplodocus "Diplodocus")*, *[Apatosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatosaurus "Apatosaurus")*, *[Brontosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brontosaurus "Brontosaurus")*, and *[Brachiosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiosaurus "Brachiosaurus")*. Dinosaurs living alongside *Camarasaurus* included the herbivorous [ornithischians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischians "Ornithischians") *[Camptosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camptosaurus "Camptosaurus")*, *[Gargoyleosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyleosaurus "Gargoyleosaurus")*, *[Dryosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryosaurus "Dryosaurus")*, *[Stegosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus "Stegosaurus")*, and *[Nanosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosaurus "Nanosaurus")*. Predators in this paleoenvironment included the [theropods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropods "Theropods") *[Torvosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torvosaurus "Torvosaurus")*, *[Ceratosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratosaurus "Ceratosaurus")*, *[Marshosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshosaurus "Marshosaurus")*, *[Stokesosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokesosaurus "Stokesosaurus")*, *[Ornitholestes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornitholestes "Ornitholestes")*,[^86] and *[Allosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosaurus "Allosaurus")*, which accounted for up to 75% of theropod specimens, and was at the top [trophic level](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level "Trophic level") of the Morrison [food web](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain "Food chain").[^87] [^88] *Camarasaurus* is commonly found at the same sites as *Allosaurus*, *Apatosaurus*, *Stegosaurus*, and *Diplodocus*.[^89]

Other organisms in this region included [bivalves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalve "Bivalve"), [snails](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail "Snail"), [ray-finned fishes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinopterygii "Actinopterygii"), [frogs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog "Frog"), [salamanders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamander "Salamander"), [turtles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle "Turtle"), [sphenodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenodontia "Sphenodontia"), [lizards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard "Lizard"), terrestrial and aquatic [crocodylomorphs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodylomorpha "Crocodylomorpha"), and several species of [pterosaurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur "Pterosaur") such as *[Harpactognathus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpactognathus "Harpactognathus")* and *[Mesadactylus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesadactylus "Mesadactylus")*. Early mammals present were [docodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docodonts "Docodonts") (such as *[Docodon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docodon "Docodon")*), [multituberculates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multituberculates "Multituberculates"), symmetrodonts, and [triconodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triconodonts "Triconodonts"). The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of [green algae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyta "Chlorophyta"), [fungi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi"), [mosses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss "Moss"), [horsetails](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equisetum "Equisetum"), [cycads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycad "Cycad"), [ginkgoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo "Ginkgo"), and several families of [conifers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer "Conifer"). Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of [tree ferns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_fern "Tree fern"), and [ferns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern "Fern") ([gallery forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_forest "Gallery forest")), to fern [savannas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") with occasional trees such as the *[Araucaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria "Araucaria")* -like conifer *[Brachyphyllum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachyphyllum "Brachyphyllum")*.[^90]
