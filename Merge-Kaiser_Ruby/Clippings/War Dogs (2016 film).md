War Dogs is a 2016 American black comedy crime film directed by [[Todd Phillips]], and written by Phillips, Jason Smilovic and [[Stephen Chin]], based on the 2011 Rolling Stone article, "Arms and the Dudes", by [[Guy Lawson]] (which was later expanded upon in a novel, also titled Arms and the Dudes.)[6][7] 

The film follows two arms dealers, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who receive a U.S. Army contract to supply ammunitions for the Afghan National Army worth approximately $300 million.[8] The film, which features an unreliable narrator and is labeled as being "based on a true story", is heavily fictionalized and dramatized,[9][10] with some of its events, such as the duo driving through Iraq, were either invented or based on other events, such as Chin's own experiences.[11][12]
