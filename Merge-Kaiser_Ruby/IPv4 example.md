A /26 subnet mask, expressed in dotted decimal notation as 255.255.255.192, divides a network into multiple subnets, each with a range of IP addresses1./26 Subnet Mask/26 Definition A /26 subnet mask has 26 network bits and 6 host bits1. It is a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation used for more efficient IP address management13.IP Addresses A /26 subnet mask provides 64 IP addresses per subnet, but only 62 are usable for hosts, as the first IP address is the network address and the last is the broadcast address1.Usable IP Range For example, in the 192.168.2.0/24 network, a /26 subnet would have a usable IP range from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.62, with 192.168.2.0 as the network address and 192.168.2.63 as the broadcast address1.

Subnetting a Class B Network A /26 subnet mask divides a Class B network into 1024 subnetworks, each having 62 usable IP addresses1.The IP address 192.168.10.120/26 falls within the 192.168.10.64 subnet, where valid host IP addresses range from 192.168.10.65 to 192.168.10.1262.
