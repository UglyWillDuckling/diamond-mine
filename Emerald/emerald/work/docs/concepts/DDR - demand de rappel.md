> ako oni to checkiraju, to je nama znak da je to super hot lead. Takvi leadovi ne idu direktno u pool sa ostalima u kampanje, nego se ili automatski assignaju sales teamu, ili nakon nekog datuma u mjesecu idu samo top-performers

The DDR (Demande de Rappel in french, Call Taskin english) is a concept that notify sales people when a seller wants to be called back (to get advices or more information about their estimation for instance). 

This DDR creates a callback task on the Backyard that is associated to a sale person.
