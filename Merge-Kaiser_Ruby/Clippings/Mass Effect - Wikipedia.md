This article is about the video game series. For the medical effect, see [Mass effect (medicine)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_effect_\(medicine\) "Mass effect (medicine)").

***Mass Effect*** is a [military science fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_science_fiction "Military science fiction") [media franchise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise "Media franchise") created by [Casey Hudson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Hudson "Casey Hudson"). The franchise depicts a distant future where humanity and several alien civilizations have colonized the galaxy using technology left behind by [advanced precursor civilizations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_race "Elder race").

The franchise originated in a series of video games developed by [BioWare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare "BioWare") and originally published by [Microsoft Game Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Game_Studios "Microsoft Game Studios") on the first two games and its expansions. Later on, the series was taken over by [Electronic Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts "Electronic Arts") through its acquisition of BioWare. Each installment is a [third-person shooter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_shooter "Third-person shooter") with [role-playing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game "Role-playing game") elements. The first three games form a trilogy in which the [player character](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character "Player character"), [Commander Shepard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Shepard "Commander Shepard"), attempts to save the [Milky Way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") galaxy from a race of ancient, hibernating machines known as the [Reapers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapers_\(Mass_Effect\) "Reapers (Mass Effect)"). The inaugural video game in the series, [*Mass Effect*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_\(video_game\) "Mass Effect (video game)") (2007), follows Shepard's investigation of [Saren Arterius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saren_Arterius "Saren Arterius"), one of the Reapers' agents. *[Mass Effect 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2 "Mass Effect 2")* (2010) begins two years later and sees Shepard's forces battling the Collectors, an alien race abducting human colonies to facilitate the Reapers' return. The original trilogy's final installment, *[Mass Effect 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3 "Mass Effect 3")* (2012), depicts a war between the Reapers and the rest of the galaxy. A fourth game, *[Mass Effect: Andromeda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda "Mass Effect: Andromeda")* (2017), featured a new setting and cast of characters, and a fifth is in active development.

The original trilogy was met with commercial success as well as universal acclaim. Critics praised the game's narrative, characters, voice acting, world building, and emphasis on player choice. The ending of *Mass Effect 3* drew widespread criticism for being an unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy, prompting Electronic Arts to release an expanded cut with additional [cutscenes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene "Cutscene"). *Mass Effect: Andromeda* received mixed reviews. Praise was directed at the game's visuals and combat, but the game drew criticism for technical issues and its plot.

The series has generated attention and discussion about its representation of [same-sex relationships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality") and [sexual minorities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_minority "Sexual minority").[^1][^2][^3] It also originated the dialogue wheel, a mechanic similar to [dialogue trees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_tree "Dialogue tree"), enabling players to dynamically steer conversations by selecting from a number of preset choices; the feature has since seen widespread use in other role-playing video games. The success of the video game series spawned adaptations in other media, including novels, comics, and an animated film.

The *Mass Effect* original trilogy takes place in the [Milky Way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") towards the end of the 22nd century. In 2148, humanity discovered an alien outpost on [Mars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), and learned that [Charon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_\(moon\) "Charon (moon)") is actually an alien artifact known as a "mass relay" that enables [faster-than-light travel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_travel "Faster-than-light travel") to other mass relays located across the galaxy. These discoveries drastically increased the enhancement rate of humanity's technology.

Humanity comes into contact with numerous other space-faring alien species, some far more advanced than humans. Humanity's first encounter resulted in the First Contact War, but the Council, a ruling body for the galaxy, intervened to achieve peace and welcomed humanity. The main species encountered by humanity include the [asari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asari_\(Mass_Effect\) "Asari (Mass Effect)"), a species of mono-gendered beings closely resembling human women; the [salarians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salarian "Salarian"), an amphibious species with considerable technological and intellectual prowess and an extremely high metabolism; and the [turians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turians "Turians"), a heavily militaristic race of raptor-like avian humanoids who fought humanity in the First Contact War.

The center of the Council's governing power is the Citadel, another artifact and a massive space station that, like the mass relays, were believed to be made by a race known as the Protheans, who were believed to be the progenitor race for all species but had long since disappeared. Over the next few decades, humanity is given access to new technology, allowing them to colonize new planets, and they are made part of the Citadel Security (C-Sec) forces, a highly regarded position that other species had been long waiting for and take resentment over. Numerous other inter-species conflicts remain active at the time of the first game, results of past wars and conflicts.

The first three games center on the character of [Commander Shepard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Shepard "Commander Shepard") (whose gender and personality are determined by the player), a leading Special Forces soldier in Earth's Systems Alliance [space force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_force "Space force"), the Systems Alliance [Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare_in_fiction#Naval_influences "Space warfare in fiction"). After an Earth colony discovers a new Prothean artifact, it is attacked by an unknown vessel, and the Council names Shepard its first human SPECTRE (**Spec**ial **T**actics and **Re**connaissance), an elite agent with associated authority and impunity, to investigate the incident.

Shepard comes in contact with the artifact and has a vision of war and death across the galaxy. Following their vision, Shepard discovers that the strange craft is one of thousands of artificial lifeforms called Reapers, and learns that every fifty-thousand years, the Reapers scour the Milky Way and eliminate all higher forms of life, leaving the younger species to advance and thrive until the next cycle as to prevent constant war and chaos, part of what the Protheans had left behind along with their artifacts. The appearance of the Reapers in this cycle is being manipulated by numerous forces, including a human-centrist terrorist organization known as Cerberus led by the [Illusive Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusive_Man "Illusive Man") who believe they can control the Reapers and use them for humanity's benefit. Shepard and their allies discover the Citadel is key to ending the Reapers' cycle and determining the fate of the galaxy.

The fourth game takes place in the Heleus Cluster of the [Andromeda galaxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy"), 634 years after the events of its predecessor. In the midst of events of the first three games, the combined races of the Milky Way sent a number of ships to Andromeda to establish the Nexus, a space-borne operations base and a number of colonies to accept future colonists once contact is established. After over 600 years of travel in [cryogenic stasis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation "Cryopreservation"), they arrive to find the Heleus Cluster in brutal conflict between two native races: the Kett, a barbaric race obsessed with assimilating the traits of other sentient species through a process known as "exaltation"; and the Angara, an emotionally charged humanoid species whose civilization has recently been targeted and nearly decimated by the Kett.

The Heleus Cluster is also the location of a series of ruins predating an advanced, spacefaring race known as the Jardaan. The Jardaan made use of powerful [terraforming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming "Terraforming") technologies to colonize worlds in the Heleus Cluster, which was otherwise extremely hazardous and naturally unsustainable for life. They later fled from the Heleus Cluster three centuries before the arrival of the Milky Way races, when a protracted battle against an unknown enemy faction resulted in the usage of a [weapon of mass destruction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction "Weapon of mass destruction") aboard a Jardaan space station. The weapon's activation unleashed a cataclysmic energy phenomenon known as the Scourge, which spread across the cluster and greatly damaged the Jardaan's terraforming systems. After the Jardaan left, the Angara, genetically engineered creations of the elder race, began to develop their own civilization before falling under attack by the encroaching Kett.

With the Milky Way species' arrival, it becomes the responsibility of Pathfinder Ryder (who, like Shepard, is also customizable by the player) and their allies to shut down the malfunctioning terraforming systems, deal with the Kett and Angara attacks, and make planets habitable for colonization.

## Development and history

*Mass Effect* began as a 2003 pitch for a project codenamed SFX by [BioWare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare "BioWare") project director [Casey Hudson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Hudson "Casey Hudson") to the company's co-founders, [Ray Muzyka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Muzyka "Ray Muzyka") and [Greg Zeschuk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Zeschuk "Greg Zeschuk"). Hudson wanted the company to set a goal on developing its own [science fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") intellectual property that is on the same scale and scope as the *[Star Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars")* setting.[^almost_were-115] On 11 October 2007, shortly before the release of the original *Mass Effect* video game for the [Xbox 360](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360 "Xbox 360") in November 2007, it was announced that EA bought out [VG Holding Corp.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/VG_Holding_Corp. "VG Holding Corp."), a partnership between BioWare and [Pandemic Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_Studios "Pandemic Studios") formed in November 2005. The *Mass Effect* IP was acquired by EA in the process and BioWare continued their role as the IP's developers.[^116]

The technological outline of the series is based on the theory of [dark energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), a form of energy proposed to be the source of the universe’s expansion, and a hypothetical instrument for faster-than-light (FTL) travel. By applying a strong electric current via dark energy to the fictional Element Zero or "eezo", "mass effect" fields could be created and manipulated: a positive current raises the mass of any object currently occupying that spot and help to create artificial gravity effects, while a negative current does the inverse by reducing mass and improves the cost-effective expenditure of fuel for starships that move at FTL speeds. The stronger the current, the greater the magnitude of the dark energy mass effect.[^meaning-117] Other real world advanced scientific concepts explored in the series include [3D printing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing "3D printing") for the omni-tool concept, [hard light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography_in_fiction "Holography in fiction") technology, and [hypervelocity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervelocity "Hypervelocity") weaponry.[^influence-118] Based on the "underlying idea that real-life scientific discoveries consistently create imagery and concepts that blow away previous notions of what is possible," Hudson opined that "reality will continue to be stranger than fiction" which in his view justifies the developers' creative license with their work.[^bluepoint-119]

Morality is measured by "Paragon" and "Renegade" points for the first three main series games, which has been described as a more nuanced continuation of the morality system surrounding the light and dark side of [the Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force "The Force") BioWare developed for their previous work, the 2003 video game *[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_\(video_game\) "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (video game)")*.[^influence-118] A spin-off for the [Nintendo DS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS "Nintendo DS") titled *Mass Effect: Corsair*, patterned after the gameplay of *[Star Control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control "Star Control")* and centered around a [Han Solo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo "Han Solo")\-inspired space pirate character played from a first-person perspective was briefly explored in 2008.[^six-120][^gs-121] The project was to be developed in tandem with the original video game trilogy, although the developers ultimately abandoned the project due to the prohibitive cost of Nintendo DS cartridges as well as the publisher's unoptimistic estimation of the projected sales data for the project, with the team and its resources reassigned to work on *[Mass Effect 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2 "Mass Effect 2")*.[^six-120][^gs-121] Former BioWare employee Dorian Kieken noted that the central concept of *Corsair* as a narrative adventure which follows a morally ambiguous protagonist would have been an ideal vehicle to explore as an expansion of the *Mass Effect* universe.[^six-120] For 2017's *[Mass Effect: Andromeda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda "Mass Effect: Andromeda")*, the binary Paragon and Renegade morality system was removed entirely.

In 2007 BioWare filed a patent for the Dialogue Wheel, described in official documents as a "graphical interface for interactive dialog," which was officially granted to its parent company EA International Studio and Publishing Ltd by the [United States Patent & Trademark Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_%26_Trademark_Office "United States Patent & Trademark Office") in 2011.[^patent-122]

Besides *Star Wars*, the *Mass Effect* universe is also inspired by several established conventions and tropes found in other [science fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") franchises, such as *[Star Trek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek "Star Trek")*, *[Blade Runner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner "Blade Runner")*, *[Firefly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_\(TV_series\) "Firefly (TV series)")*, and *[Battlestar Galactica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica "Battlestar Galactica")*.[^influence-118][^important-123] Other intellectual properties which influenced the series' atmosphere and artistic qualities included *[Alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(film\) "Alien (film)")*, *[Starship Troopers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_\(film\) "Starship Troopers (film)")*, *[Dune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(franchise\) "Dune (franchise)")* and *[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy:_The_Spirits_Within "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within")*.[^xbox_gazette_interview-124][^unlimited_enabled-125][^spirits_within-126] Several video games fed into Hudson's vision for the gameplay experience of the series: these include *[Deus Ex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_\(video_game\) "Deus Ex (video game)")*’s choice-based branching storylines, the gunplay mechanics of the [*Halo*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_\(franchise\) "Halo (franchise)") franchise, and the open-ended galaxy exploration of the [MS-DOS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS") game *[Starflight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starflight "Starflight")*.[^influence-118]

Aspects of [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology") have been consistently invoked throughout the series, from the names of in-universe objects and organizations like the planet Elysium or the anthropocentric paramilitary group Cerberus, to the narrative themes of certain story arcs like the Prothean's connection to the contemporary civilizations of the galaxy through the technology they left behind.[^influence-118][^kotaku-127]

The music of the series is noted for its similarity in style to the vintage synthesizer score for *Blade Runner*, which creates a mood appropriate for the oscillating wonder and terror of unknown space.[^influence-118] According to Jack Wall, who served as the composer for the first two *Mass Effect* games, he combined the electronic instrument palette from the late 1970s to early 1980s with organic elements to create the first game's [soundscape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape "Soundscape"). [^wall_interview_3-128] Subsequent games have adopted a more cinematic, orchestral style with the involvement of composers like [Clint Mansell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Mansell "Clint Mansell"), while retaining certain elements of Wall's earlier work for the franchise.[^influence-118]

The original *Mass Effect* trilogy has received near-universal critical acclaim across all release platforms, according to [review aggregator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"). All three games have received numerous nominations as well as number of year-end awards from video game publications and major award ceremonies. The first two *Mass Effect* titles are widely considered to be among [the greatest games of all time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best "List of video games considered the best"). *Mass Effect 2* in particular is the most critically acclaimed game in the series and garnered numerous game of the year awards following its release. It received over 70 perfect review scores.[^142] In 2013 *[IGN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN")* rated the *Mass Effect Trilogy* the best Xbox 360 game(s) out of a list of 25,[^143] and the 7th best PS3 game(s) out of a list of 25.[^144]

The fourth installment, *Mass Effect: Andromeda*, received a less enthusiastic critical reception, with a consensus among critics that it was not up to par with its predecessors in terms of overall quality, although the improved combat received praise.[^145][^146]

The *Mass Effect* franchise has been successful commercially. The first game in the franchise sold over one million units worldwide in less than three weeks after launch.[^3_weeks_sales-147] Sales rose to 1.6 million copies after six weeks of availability by January 2008.[^gamedailysales-148][^fox_news-149] Its sequel, *Mass Effect 2* shipped two million copies to retailers two weeks after the game was released.[^150] The game sold over 500,000 copies in the month of release, despite being released at the end of the month.[^151] Before the release of the third game, the series sold a combined total of 7 million copies worldwide.[^152] *Mass Effect 3* was the most commercially successful game of the series: it sold over 800,000 copies in its first 24 hours,[^153] and its opening month sales were twice that of its predecessor's,[^154] selling over 900,000 copies on the Xbox 360 version, outselling the PlayStation 3 version 4 to 1 and bringing in over $200 million in revenue.[^155] By April 2012 it sold over twice as many copies as *Mass Effect 2* in their respective launch months[^156] and generated lifetime sales of over six million copies.[^157] The *Mass Effect* series had sold a total of 14 million units by July 5, 2014.[^158]

*Mass Effect: Andromeda* continued the sales success of its predecessors.[^159] By May 2017, an analyst noted that at least 2.5 million retail copies of *Mass Effect: Andromeda* had been shipped for $110 million in revenue.[^160] Additionally, $53 million in net sales from digital and special editions for *Andromeda* were generated in March 2017 but deferred to a later date.[^161]

## Legacy and cultural impact
