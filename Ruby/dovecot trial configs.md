# Disable LOGIN command and all other plaintext authentications unless

# connection is considered secure and plaintext authentication is allowed.
# See also ssl=required setting.

# bsdauth and PAM require cache_key to be set for caching to be used.

# Time to live for cached data. After TTL expires the cached record is no
# longer used, *except* if the main database lookup returns internal failure.

# authentication was successful, but this one wasn't, the cache isn't used.
# For now this works only with plaintext authentication.

# TTL for negative hits (user not found, password mismatch).
# 0 disables caching them completely.
#auth_cache_negative_ttl = 1 hour

# Space separated list of realms for SASL authentication mechanisms that need
# them. You can leave it empty if you don't want to support multiple realms.
# Many clients simply use the first one listed here, so keep the default realm
# first.

# a character not listed in here, the login automatically fails. This is just

# set this value to empty.
#auth_username_chars = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567890.-_@

# If you want to allow master users to log in by specifying the master
# username within the normal username string (ie. not using SASL mechanism's

# User database specifies where mails are located and what user/group IDs
# own them. For single-UID configuration use "static" userdb.
