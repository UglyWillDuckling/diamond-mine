A playthrough of Vap and NTVIC's 1991 NES game, Isolated Warrior.  
  
Played through the whole game without losing any lives - this allowed me to play the secret seventh stage and fight the true final boss. I didn't use the power up warps during the game (I didn't see a need to), but at the very end of the video I show one from stage one so you could see what they look like.  
  
I really like this game. It's perspective takes a bit to get used to, but it works and adds a very different feel to everything than a straight top-down viewpoint would give. It resembles Zaxxon, Viewpoint, and Zen: Inyergalactic Ninja in quite a few ways. It's super obscure, but I'd highly recommend it.  
  
No cheats were used during the recording of this video.
