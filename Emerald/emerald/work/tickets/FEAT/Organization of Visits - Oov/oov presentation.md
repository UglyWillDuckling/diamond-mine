2. so, to wrap things up we will quickly show you how all this looks on the Backyard

1. here we have the project page which is the same project that [[Team Pulsar]] was working with a moment ago.
2. you can see we have the `Evaluations` tab right here in the middle -> let's open thatc
3. so now can see first the **Planification automatique**, a new section that we added.
4. All the information that you see here is coming from the Pulsar module
5. and finally we've also added a new column to display the  **automatic visits status**
	1. the info here, just like the owner schedule above%% point at schedule  %% is coming from the new module
