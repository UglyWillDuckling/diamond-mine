☀️ Hi, friend! My name is Han. I graduated from Columbia University last year and I studied Math and Operations Research. In this video, I talk about why math can be very difficult and seem nonsensical at times. I share the system that I use to practice math problems in an enjoyable and effective way, and I explain how you can do the same. I understand that math can become very challenging when you don't find studying it enjoyable, so I hope this video can be motivating and helpful if you're currently struggling with math!  
This video is almost a more complete and polished remake of my very first video on this channel. I’ve conducted more research on the topic and have improved my video-making skills:)
