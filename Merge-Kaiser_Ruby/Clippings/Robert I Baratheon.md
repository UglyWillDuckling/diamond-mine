## Appearance and Character

Robert has the classic [Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Baratheon "House Baratheon") look: black hair and bright blue eyes.[^ragot58.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-14] His heavy black hair is thick on his chest, and coarse around his sex.[^raffc32.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-15] He is a very tall man;[^ragot58.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-14] [Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark") estimates his height to be six and a half feet.[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16]

As a young adult, Robert was a handsome,[^ragot58.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-14] clean-shaven man,[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16] with rough and hard hands.[^raffc9.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-17] He was strong and powerful, and muscled "like a maiden's fantasy."[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16] After putting down [Greyjoy's Rebellion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greyjoy%27s_Rebellion "Greyjoy's Rebellion") in [289 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/289_AC "289 AC"), however, Robert's appearance began to change. Due to excessive feasting and drinking, Robert gained a significant amount of weight.

Born in [262 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/262_AC "262 AC"),[^rtwoiaf417.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-11] Robert was the first born child of [Cassana Estermont](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cassana_Estermont "Cassana Estermont") and [Steffon Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Steffon_Baratheon "Steffon Baratheon"), [Lord of Storm's End](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_of_Storm%27s_End "Lord of Storm's End"), [Lord Paramount of the Stormlands](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Paramount_of_the_Stormlands "Lord Paramount of the Stormlands"), and head of [House Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Baratheon "House Baratheon"). He was a scant year older than his brother, [Stannis](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon "Stannis Baratheon"), who was born in [264 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Years_after_Aegon%27s_Conquest#Year_264_After_the_Conquest "Years after Aegon's Conquest").[^46] When Robert was already in his teens, his youngest brother, [Renly](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon "Renly Baratheon"), was born.[^47]

According to Stannis, when Robert was five or six years old, the two brothers were brought to court by their father, Steffon, where they witnessed the [Hand of the King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand_of_the_King "Hand of the King"), Lord [Tywin Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister "Tywin Lannister"), sitting on the [Iron Throne](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Throne "Iron Throne") and holding court.[^rasos54.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-48] Young Robert also played with an [Estermont](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Estermont "House Estermont") [cousin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Estermont_\(cousin_of_Robert\) "Estermont (cousin of Robert)") whose father was good to the future king.[^raffc24.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-30] Robert had a gyrfalcon named [Thunderclap](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Thunderclap "Thunderclap") who never missed her strike, and he mocked Stannis's goshawk, [Proudwing](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Proudwing "Proudwing"), as "Weakwing".[^racok10.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-49]

From an early age onwards, Robert had been fostered by Lord [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn "Jon Arryn") at the [Eyrie](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eyrie "Eyrie") in the [Vale of Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vale_of_Arryn "Vale of Arryn"), together with [Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark") of [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell "Winterfell"). The two boys became fast friends, and Jon, who had no children of his own, became like a second father to them.[^ragot2.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-40][^rawoiafrobert_baratheon.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-50] During the period in which he was fostered, Robert visited [Storm's End](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Storm%27s_End "Storm's End") on multiple occasions.[^rawoiafrobert_baratheon.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-50] At some point, Robert was [knighted](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight "Knight").[^rtwoiafthe_fall_of_the_dragons:_robert.27s_rebellion.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-1] During a [tourney at Storm's End](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Storm%27s_End "Tourney at Storm's End"), Robert was defeated by Ser [Barristan Selmy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy "Barristan Selmy").[^rasos67.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-51]

After reaching manhood, Robert divided his time between Storm's End and the Eyrie. In [278 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Years_after_Aegon%27s_Conquest#Year_278_After_the_Conquest "Years after Aegon's Conquest"), Robert's father was sent on a mission by King [Aerys II Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen "Aerys II Targaryen"), to travel to [Volantis](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Volantis "Volantis") to find a bride for Robert's cousin, Prince [Rhaegar Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegar_Targaryen "Rhaegar Targaryen"). The mission failed, and Steffon, accompanied by his wife, returned home.[^rtwoiaf417.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-11] Robert and Stannis watched their parents' ship, *[Windproud](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Windproud "Windproud")*, sink in a storm in [Shipbreaker Bay](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shipbreaker_Bay "Shipbreaker Bay") while nearing Storm's End.[^racokprologue.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-18] With his father's death, Robert became the Lord of Storm's End.

In [281 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/281_AC "281 AC"), Robert was present at the [tourney at Harrenhal](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Harrenhal "Tourney at Harrenhal"), where he took part in the melee.[^ragot58.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-14] He held a drinking contest with Ser [Richard Lonmouth](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Richard_Lonmouth "Richard Lonmouth"), and swore to unmask the [mystery knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mystery_knight "Mystery knight") known as the [Knight of the Laughing Tree](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree "Knight of the Laughing Tree"), although he failed to do so.[^rasos24.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-8] It was Robert's cousin, Prince [Rhaegar Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegar_Targaryen "Rhaegar Targaryen"), who won the final joust of the tourney.

There are some who say that Robert had laughed, stating that Rhaegar had only paid Lyanna her due, though according to men who knew Robert better, he felt it had been an insult, on which he brooded long, causing him to harden against Rhaegar.[^rtwoiafthe_fall_of_the_dragons:_the_year_of_the_false_spring.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-53]

When Robert learned that Lords [Grandison](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Grandison "Lord Grandison"), [Cafferen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Cafferen "Lord Cafferen"), and [Fell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Fell "Lord Fell") planned to gather their hosts at [Summerhall](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Summerhall "Summerhall") in order to march on Storm's End, he rode ahead with his knights. He [fought each of the lords](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battles_at_Summerhall "Battles at Summerhall") in turn, defeating all three.[^rasos54.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-48] Robert returned to Storm's End with his captives, and there won the loyalty of Lords Cafferen and Grandison, as well as, [Silveraxe Fell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silveraxe_Fell "Silveraxe Fell"), the son of Lord Fell whom Robert had slain.[^rasos54.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-48][^rasos36.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-36]

Stannis was torn between loyalty to his brother or to the king, ultimately siding with his family.[^rasos36.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-36] Lord [Randyll Tarly](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Randyll_Tarly "Randyll Tarly") fell upon Robert with his van and defeated Robert's forces at the [Battle of Ashford](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Ashford "Battle of Ashford"), before Lord [Mace Tyrell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell "Mace Tyrell") could arrive with the main force from the [Reach](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Reach "Reach").[^rasos19.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-55] Robert escaped capture with the bulk of his forces,[^rawoiafrobert_baratheon.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-50] however, and continued his journey north. Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert, and so replaced Lord [Owen Merryweather](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Owen_Merryweather "Owen Merryweather") with Lord [Jon Connington](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Connington "Jon Connington") as his [Hand of the King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand_of_the_King "Hand of the King").[^radwdepilogue.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-56][^raffc14.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-57] Connington personally led a mighty army into the field, giving chase to Robert, whose march became grueling.[^rawoiafrobert_baratheon.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-50] Wounded and separated from his men,[^rasos29.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-58][^radwd61.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-43] Robert took refuge at [Stoney Sept](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stoney_Sept "Stoney Sept").[^rasos29.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-58] When Connington and his army arrived at the town and began searching the houses, the residents actively aided Robert, keeping him hidden from the king's men. In the end, they hid him in a brothel. When Lords [Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark") and [Hoster Tully](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hoster_Tully "Hoster Tully") arrived with a rebel army, Robert came out of hiding and fought with Connington, almost killing him.[^radwd61.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-43] One of Robert's [bastard](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bastard "Bastard") children, [Bella](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bella "Bella"), fathered upon a whore in the whorehouse, was named after the [Battle of the Bells](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Bells "Battle of the Bells").[^rasos29.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-58]

King Aerys began to realize that Robert was the greatest threat to the Targaryen dynasty since [Daemon I Blackfyre](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre "Daemon I Blackfyre"), and exiled Connington, naming Lord [Qarlton Chelsted](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qarlton_Chelsted "Qarlton Chelsted") as his Hand in Connington's stead.[^rasos37.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-59] To secure the aid of [House Tully](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tully "House Tully"), Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark married Lord Hoster's daughters, [Lysa](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lysa_Arryn "Lysa Arryn") and [Catelyn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Stark "Catelyn Stark").[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16] According to a semi-canon source, Robert attended [the double wedding](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Weddings_of_Catelyn_and_Lysa_Tully "Weddings of Catelyn and Lysa Tully") at [Riverrun](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Riverrun "Riverrun").[^rawoiafrobert_baratheon.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-50]

Robert led the rebel forces during the [Battle of the Trident](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Trident "Battle of the Trident"), the decisive battle near war's end. Around this time, Robert proclaimed his intention to claim the [Iron Throne](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Throne "Iron Throne"). Out of the three leaders of the rebellion, Robert had the better claim,[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20] due to the fact that his grandmother had been Princess [Rhaelle Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaelle_Targaryen "Rhaelle Targaryen"), the youngest daughter of King [Aegon V Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen "Aegon V Targaryen").[^raffc35.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-61] However, some feel that it was conquest which truly won Robert the throne, despite the [maesters](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maester "Maester") citing his blood ties to [House Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Targaryen "House Targaryen") as justification.[^racok22.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-62]

In [283 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/283_AC "283 AC")[^64] the rebel and loyalist forces fought at a place that became known as the [ruby ford](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ruby_ford "Ruby ford"), located on the northern bank of the [Trident](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trident "Trident").[^ragot15.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-65] Robert and Prince [Rhaegar Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegar_Targaryen "Rhaegar Targaryen") met on horseback in single combat, with the battle raging on all around them.[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16] Rhaegar wounded Robert[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24] before Robert killed Rhaegar with a blow to the chest from his warhammer.[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16] Eventually, the Targaryen host broke and ran.[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24] When Lord [Roose Bolton](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Roose_Bolton "Roose Bolton") advised Robert to execute Ser [Barristan Selmy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy "Barristan Selmy"), a captured knight of Aerys's [Kingsguard](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard "Kingsguard"), Robert refused, and instead had his own maester treat the wounds of Barristan the Bold.[^ragot33.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-26]

Himself wounded and unable to chase the loyalists,[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24][^rtwoiafthe_fall_of_the_dragons:_robert.27s_rebellion.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-1] Robert gave the pursuit of the remnants of the Targaryen army to Lord Stark. Leading the van, Eddard followed the loyalists back to King's Landing.[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24][^rasos37.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-59] However, Lord [Tywin Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister "Tywin Lannister") had arrived earlier with an army, which began attacking the city after Grand Maester [Pycelle](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pycelle "Pycelle") convinced Aerys to admit them within the gates.[^rasos37.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-59] Aerys was slain in the [Sack of King's Landing](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing "Sack of King's Landing") by Ser [Jaime Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister "Jaime Lannister"), Tywin's son and a member of the Kingsguard.[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24] After Robert arrived in King's Landing, Tywin presented him with the mutilated bodies of Princess [Elia Martell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Elia_Martell "Elia Martell"), Rhaegar's wife, and their two young children, Princess [Rhaenys](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenys_Targaryen_\(daughter_of_Rhaegar\) "Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)") and Prince [Aegon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_\(son_of_Rhaegar\) "Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)"). While Robert was pleased they were dead, Eddard was outraged and disgusted by the act, calling it murder, and saying the young prince and princess were no more than babes. Robert's response was, "I see no babes, only [dragonspawn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragon "Dragon")". The argument led to Eddard leaving King's Landing the next day, to fight the final battles alone. It took the death of Lyanna and their shared grief to reunite the pair in friendship.[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24] Robert was thereafter haunted by Lyanna's memory and the desire for further vengeance against the slain Rhaegar.[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16]

In late [283 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/283_AC "283 AC"), Robert was crowned king. He chose his second father,[^ragot2.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-40] Lord [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn "Jon Arryn"), as his [Hand of the King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand_of_the_King "Hand of the King").[^rtwoiafthe_glorious_reign.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-66] Pardoning many of his former enemies, Robert appointed Ser [Barristan Selmy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy "Barristan Selmy") as the [Lord Commander](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Commander_of_the_Kingsguard "Lord Commander of the Kingsguard") of his [Kingsguard](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard "Kingsguard"). Despite [Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark") urging Robert to strip Ser [Jaime Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister "Jaime Lannister") of his white cloak, Robert listened to Jon's advice, and pardoned Jaime together with the [master of whisperers](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Master_of_whisperers "Master of whisperers"), Lord [Varys](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys "Varys"), and the [Grand Maester](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Grand_Maester "Grand Maester"), [Pycelle](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pycelle "Pycelle"),[^racok55.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-67] and Jaime continued to serve in the Kingsguard along with Barristan.[^racok3.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-27] At his [coronation feast](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coronation_of_Robert_I_Baratheon "Coronation of Robert I Baratheon"), Robert joked to Jaime about the fact that Jaime was already being called "Kingslayer".[^rasos37.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-59] Robert allowed Ser [Ronald Connington](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ronald_Connington "Ronald Connington") to keep [Griffin's Roost](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Griffin%27s_Roost "Griffin's Roost"), although Robert kept the gold[^raffc27.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-68] and most of [House Connington](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Connington "House Connington")'s lands were granted to neighbors.[^radwd61.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-43] Robert replaced the [skulls of the Targaryen dragons](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Skulls_of_the_Targaryen_dragons "Skulls of the Targaryen dragons") in the [Red Keep](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Keep "Red Keep")'s throne room with banners and [tapestries](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tapestries "Tapestries") depicting hunting and battle.[^ragot13.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-69][^ragot43.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-70][^ragot49.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-71]

Robert tasked his brother [Stannis](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon "Stannis Baratheon") with building a new [royal fleet](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Royal_fleet "Royal fleet") and capturing [Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone "Dragonstone"), the last Targaryen-loyalist stronghold, where the pregnant Dowager Queen [Rhaella Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaella_Targaryen "Rhaella Targaryen") and her son [Viserys](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen "Viserys Targaryen") remained. Stannis led the [assault on Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Assault_on_Dragonstone "Assault on Dragonstone") some nine months[^72] after the Trident, but Viserys and the newly-born [Daenerys Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen "Daenerys Targaryen") had been smuggled from the island shortly before by Ser [Willem Darry](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willem_Darry "Willem Darry"). Robert blamed Stannis for letting the Targaryen children escape, even though the two children had been spirited to safety by Targaryen loyalists shortly before Stannis had set sail.[^racokprologue.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-18][^ragot3.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-4][^racok25.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-73]

As he now resided in [King's Landing](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/King%27s_Landing "King's Landing"), Robert granted the ancestral Baratheon seat of [Storm's End](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Storm%27s_End "Storm's End") to his youngest brother, [Renly](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon "Renly Baratheon"), while naming Stannis as [Lord of Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_of_Dragonstone "Lord of Dragonstone"). Both Stannis and Queen [Cersei Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister "Cersei Lannister") believe that Robert intended this as a slight against Stannis,[^racokprologue.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-18][^racok25.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-73] but according to [George R. R. Martin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/George_R._R._Martin "George R. R. Martin") Robert had not necessarily meant it as such. Dragonstone had traditionally been the seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, the [Prince of Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Prince_of_Dragonstone "Prince of Dragonstone"), during most of the Targaryen dynasty, so the then-childless Robert was granting it to his heir at that time, Stannis. Stannis became the head of [House Baratheon of Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Baratheon_of_Dragonstone "House Baratheon of Dragonstone"), with Robert heading [House Baratheon of King's Landing](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Baratheon_of_King%27s_Landing "House Baratheon of King's Landing")

Although peace returned to the [Seven Kingdoms](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Seven_Kingdoms "Seven Kingdoms"), many of those who did not support Robert referred to him as the [Usurper](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Usurper "Usurper"). [Dorne](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dorne "Dorne") never forgot or forgave that Robert condoned the murders of Princess [Elia Martell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Elia_Martell "Elia Martell") and her two young children, Princess [Rhaenys](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenys_Targaryen_\(daughter_of_Rhaegar\) "Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)") and Prince [Aegon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_\(son_of_Rhaegar\) "Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaegar)"). The year after Robert took the throne, Elia's younger brother, Prince [Oberyn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Oberyn_Martell "Oberyn Martell"), began plotting a rebellion in the name of the exiled Viserys. Lord [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn "Jon Arryn"), Robert's new [Hand of the King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand_of_the_King "Hand of the King"), travelled to Dorne, sat down with [Doran Martell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doran_Martell "Doran Martell"), the [Prince of Dorne](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Prince_of_Dorne "Prince of Dorne"), and ended all talk of rebellion.

Though Robert had no wish to marry after [Lyanna Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyanna_Stark "Lyanna Stark")'s death, the realm needed an heir, and Lord [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn "Jon Arryn") suggested that Robert marry Lady [Cersei Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister "Cersei Lannister"), the only daughter of Lord [Tywin Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister "Tywin Lannister"), to ensure political stability and Tywin's support should [Viserys Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen "Viserys Targaryen") ever attempt to win back his throne.[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20] Robert and Cersei were married in [284 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/284_AC "284 AC")[^75] in the [Great Sept of Baelor](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Sept_of_Baelor "Great Sept of Baelor"),[^raffc28.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-41] with Robert draping her with a heavy golden cloak decorated with an [onyx](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Onyx "Onyx") stag.[^raffc12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-76] A tourney was held to celebrate [the royal wedding](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wedding_of_Robert_I_Baratheon_and_Cersei_Lannister "Wedding of Robert I Baratheon and Cersei Lannister"),[^rasos67.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-51] and [Gerion Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gerion_Lannister "Gerion Lannister") gave the king a gilded dagger with an [ivory](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ivory "Ivory") grip and a sapphire pommel.[^rasos32.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-44] Robert named Ser [Ilyn Payne](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ilyn_Payne "Ilyn Payne") as [King's Justice](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/King%27s_Justice "King's Justice") as a gift for Tywin.[^raffc27.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-68] On their wedding night, however, a drunken Robert accidentally whispered, "Lyanna" into Cersei's ear while [consummating the marriage](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bedding "Bedding"), an act that would set the tone for their marriage.[^ragot45.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-35] That was the only night when sex between Robert and Cersei was consensual.[^raffc32.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-15]

While Robert "claimed his rights" frequently during the early years of their marriage, his [drinking](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alcohol "Alcohol") led to him hurting Cersei during those encounters. When she confronted him once during their first year of marriage, Robert claimed it was because of the drink, and he was not to blame. According to Robert, he did not remember anything of those nights, but according to Cersei, Robert did recall what he did to her, but felt that pretending to have forgotten was easier than facing the truth. Over time, Robert came to Cersei's bed less frequently, not even once a year.[^raffc32.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-15] Cersei began to loathe her husband,[^racok3.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-27] and her cold attitude towards him created a distance between them.[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20] Robert remained in love with Lyanna for years after her death,[^ragot8.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-77] placing further strain upon the marriage.

Cersei has had an incestuous relationship with her twin brother, [Jaime Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister "Jaime Lannister"), for years, and they continued their illicit relationship after Cersei's marriage to Robert. Although Robert often urged Cersei to join his hunts in the early years of their marriage, Cersei refused so she could discretely be with her brother.[^raffc26.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-78] Two of Robert's [Estermont](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Estermont "House Estermont") uncles had spent half a year at court following his wedding, and Robert insisted on repaying the visit. They remained on [Greenstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greenstone "Greenstone") for a fortnight. There, Robert slept with a widowed [cousin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Estermont_\(cousin_of_Robert\) "Estermont (cousin of Robert)"), and upon learning this, Cersei had sex with Jaime whilst in the castle.[^raffc24.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-30]

Cersei gave birth to three children: Prince [Joffrey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Baratheon "Joffrey Baratheon"), born in [286 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Years_after_Aegon%27s_Conquest#Year_286_After_the_Conquest "Years after Aegon's Conquest"), Princess [Myrcella](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Myrcella_Baratheon "Myrcella Baratheon"), born in [289 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/289_AC "289 AC"), and Prince [Tommen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tommen_Baratheon "Tommen Baratheon"), born in [290 AC](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/290_AC "290 AC").[^79] Though everyone, including Robert, believed them to be Robert's children, Jaime is the biological father of all three.[^ragot45.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-35] Robert did not attend any of the births; whenever Cersei's time was due, he left for a hunt, returning only after the birth.[^racok52.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-80] Cersei became pregnant by Robert only once. Refusing to give birth to Robert's child, she had Jaime find a woman to cleanse her.[^ragot45.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-35]

Six years after taking the crown, Robert joined forces with his [Warden of the North](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warden_of_the_North "Warden of the North"), Lord [Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark"), and his [Warden of the West](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warden_of_the_West "Warden of the West"), Lord [Tywin Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister "Tywin Lannister"), to crush [Greyjoy's Rebellion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greyjoy%27s_Rebellion "Greyjoy's Rebellion"), which lasted less than a year.

Robert does not like his kingship;[^ragot33.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-26] according to [Donal Noye](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Donal_Noye "Donal Noye"), Robert changed by becoming king, and not for the better.[^racok6.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-85] He finds business concerning [coin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Currency "Currency"), crops, or [justice](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Law_and_justice "Law and justice") tedious.[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32] Robert barely attends [small council](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Small_council "Small council") sessions,[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32][^ragot27.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-38][^racok3.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-27] preferring to hunt and [hawk](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hawk "Hawk") instead,[^raffc24.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-30][^racok3.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-27] and when he does attend, he usually dozes through them.[^raffc24.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-30] He leaves the task of ruling to his small council,[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32] mostly to Lord [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn "Jon Arryn"), his [Hand of the King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand_of_the_King "Hand of the King"), and to Lord [Stannis Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon "Stannis Baratheon"), his younger brother and the [master of ships](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Master_of_ships "Master of ships").[^raffc24.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-30][^racokprologue.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-18] Robert loathes "counting coppers",[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32][^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24] but loves to organize tournaments and feasts, and so has beggared the realm.[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32] Despite the fact that King [Aerys II Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen "Aerys II Targaryen") had left treasure vaults overflowing with gold, Robert's spending has left the crown in debt of over six million [golden](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gold "Gold") [dragons](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Currency "Currency") (borrowing heavily from the [Lannisters](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Lannister "House Lannister"), the [Tyrells](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tyrell "House Tyrell"), the [Faith](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faith_of_the_Seven "Faith of the Seven"), and the [Iron Bank of Braavos](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Bank_of_Braavos "Iron Bank of Braavos")).[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32] [Silver](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silver "Silver") stags have been minted with Robert's face on one side and a [stag](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stag "Stag") on the reverse.[^raffc14.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-57]

Though Robert loves him,[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20] he does not have a close bond with his heir, Prince [Joffrey Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Baratheon "Joffrey Baratheon").[^raffc28.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-41] Robert disliked that Joffrey always cried when he picked him up as a babe, as his [bastard](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bastard "Bastard") children gurgled at him happily.[^racok52.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-80] Nor was he fond of Joffrey's nature.[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20] For instance, when Joffrey cut open a pregnant [cat](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cat "Cat") to see if there were kittens inside its belly and then shown his father what he'd done, Robert hit the boy, knocking out two of his teeth.[^rasos52.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-86][^rasos63.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-87] Robert claims he has dreamed of giving up his crown, but that the thought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear has stopped him.[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20]

Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several [bastards](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bastards "Bastards") during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight.

According to Robert, he was too drunk to know which bed it was.

When his [Hand of the King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand_of_the_King "Hand of the King"), Lord [Jon Arryn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Arryn "Jon Arryn"), dies suddenly, Robert decides to offer the position to his old childhood friend, [Eddard Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark"), [Lord of Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_of_Winterfell "Lord of Winterfell").[^ragot2.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-40] Displeased that he was not chosen,[^racok33.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-97] [Stannis Baratheon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon "Stannis Baratheon"), Robert's younger brother, sails from [King's Landing](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/King%27s_Landing "King's Landing") to his own seat of [Dragonstone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone "Dragonstone").[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32]

Traveling with a large retinue to the [north](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/North "North"), Robert insists upon paying his respects at the tomb of [Lyanna Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyanna_Stark "Lyanna Stark") within the [crypt of Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Crypt_of_Winterfell "Crypt of Winterfell"). The king offers a betrothal between his own son, Prince [Joffrey](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Baratheon "Joffrey Baratheon"), and Eddard's eldest daughter, [Sansa](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sansa_Stark "Sansa Stark"). Eddard is shocked how much Robert has changed since he last saw him, at the end of [Greyjoy's Rebellion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greyjoy%27s_Rebellion "Greyjoy's Rebellion").[^ragot4.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-16] Eddard reluctantly accepts the position of Hand.[^ragot6.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-98] While Robert and Eddard are away hunting, [Bran Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bran_Stark "Bran Stark") discovers Queen [Cersei Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister "Cersei Lannister") and her twin, Ser [Jaime Lannister](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister "Jaime Lannister") of Robert's [Kingsguard](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard "Kingsguard"), in the [First Keep](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_Keep "First Keep"). Jaime throws Bran from the tower,[^ragot8.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-77] leaving the boy crippled and comatose.[^ragot9.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-99] A [catspaw](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catspaw "Catspaw") later attempts to assassinate Bran with a [Valyrian steel dagger](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_steel_dagger "Valyrian steel dagger").[^ragot14.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-100]

While riding through the [barrowlands](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barrowlands "Barrowlands"), Robert discusses the marriage of the exiled Princess [Daenerys Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen "Daenerys Targaryen") to [Drogo](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Drogo "Drogo"), a *[khal](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Khal "Khal")* of the [Dothraki](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dothraki "Dothraki"), and the king is uncertain about Ned's opinion that the marriage does not represent a danger.[^ragot12.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-24] At [Castle Darry](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Castle_Darry "Castle Darry"), after Joffrey has been attacked by [Arya Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark "Arya Stark")'s direwolf, [Nymeria](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nymeria_\(direwolf\) "Nymeria (direwolf)"), Robert is willing to call the incident simply an argument between two children. As the direwolf has disappeared, the beast cannot be executed. When Cersei suggests Sansa's direwolf, [Lady](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lady "Lady"), be executed instead, Robert does nothing to stop it, despite loathing the suggestion.[^ragot16.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-101] Robert does not wish to face Eddard and spends the remaining fortnight of the journey drunk in Cersei's [wheelhouse](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wheelhouse "Wheelhouse").[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32]

Against Ned's wishes, Robert decides to host a tourney for his friend's appointment as Hand of the King.[^ragot20.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-32] The king plans to fight in the melee portion of the [Hand's tourney](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand%27s_tourney "Hand's tourney"), loudly shouting at Cersei when she openly attempts to forbid him.[^ragot29.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-103] Eddard and Ser [Barristan Selmy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy "Barristan Selmy") convince him that the fight would be unfair, as every contestant would let their king win, which angers Robert, as it touches on his pride. He eventually does not participate in the melee. Lord [Varys](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys "Varys") later tells Eddard that Cersei had planned to have Robert killed during the melee. Robert confesses to Eddard that he dreams about giving up his crown and journeying to the [Free Cities](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Free_Cities "Free Cities") as a [sellsword](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sellsword "Sellsword") to spend his life warring and whoring, but he worries about Cersei's influence on Joffrey.[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20]

When Robert calls a meeting to demand the assassination of Daenerys, who is now pregnant with Drogo's child, Eddard resigns in protest.[^ragot33.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-26] After Eddard is injured in an ambush led by Jaime,[^ragot35.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-37] Robert visits his friend and gives him back his badge of office, stating that if Eddard refuses to take it, Robert will pin it on Jaime.[^ragot39.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-23]

> The [gods](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gods "Gods") be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. [A crown](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Throne "Iron Throne") ... it was [the girl](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyanna_Stark "Lyanna Stark") I prayed them for. Your sister, safe ... and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a [crown](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Crown "Crown")?

## Quotes about Robert

> The king was a great disappointment to Jon. [His father](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark "Eddard Stark") had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, [demon](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Demons "Demons") [of the Trident](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Trident "Battle of the Trident"), the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his [silks](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silk "Silk"). He walked like a man half in his cups.[^ragot5.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-5]

> [The eunuch](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys "Varys") had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon he could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done.[^ragot30.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-20]

> Robert wanted smiles and cheers, always, so he went where he found them, to his friends and his [whores](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Whore "Whore"). Robert wanted to be loved.

Robert would gallop up to the gates of [Winterfell](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell "Winterfell") alone, break them with his [warhammer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_hammer "War hammer"), and ride through the rubble to slay [Roose Bolton](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Roose_Bolton "Roose Bolton") with his left hand and [the Bastard](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ramsay_Snow "Ramsay Snow") with his right. I am not Robert. But [we will march](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/March_on_Winterfell "March on Winterfell"), and we will free Winterfell ... or die in the attempt.[^radwd42.7b.7b.7b3.7d.7d.7d.7b.7b.7b4.7d.7d.7d-125]

## Family

## Behind the Scenes

According to [George R. R. Martin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/George_R._R._Martin "George R. R. Martin"), Robert is partially inspired by [Edward IV of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England "w:Edward IV of England"), and he also has similarities with [Henry VIII of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England "w:Henry VIII of England").

In an early draft of *[A Storm of Swords](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords "A Storm of Swords")*, [Tywin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister "Tywin Lannister") mentions that Robert owned a 6,000-year-old [bronze](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bronze "Bronze") [runeblade](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rune "Rune") and a [dragonglass](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass "Dragonglass") dirk made by the [children of the forest](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Children_of_the_forest "Children of the forest").[^129]

Before writing *[The Hedge Knight](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Hedge_Knight "The Hedge Knight")* for the *Legends* anthology, George R. R. Martin considered writing a novella about Robert before he was king.[^130]

Rhaella left the capital in-between the [Battle of the Trident](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Trident "Battle of the Trident") and the [Sack of King's Landing](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing "Sack of King's Landing"), which occurred a fortnight apart.
