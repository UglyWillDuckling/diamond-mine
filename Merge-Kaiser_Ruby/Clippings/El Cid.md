**Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar** (c. 1043 – 10 July 1099) was a Castilian [knight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight "Knight") and ruler in [medieval Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Spain "Medieval Spain"). Fighting both with [Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian "Christian") and [Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") armies during his lifetime, he earned the Arabic honorific *as-Sayyid* ("the Lord" or "the Master"), which would evolve into **El Çid** (Spanish:[\[elˈθið\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Spanish "Help:IPA/Spanish"), Old Spanish:[\[elˈts̻id\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA "Help:IPA")), and the Spanish honorific **El Campeador** ("the Champion"). He was born in [Vivar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivar_del_Cid "Vivar del Cid"), a village near the city of [Burgos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos "Burgos").

As the head of his loyal knights, he came to dominate the [Levante](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levante,_Spain "Levante, Spain") of the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula") at the end of the 11th century. He reclaimed the [Taifa of Valencia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Valencia "Taifa of Valencia") from Moorish control for a brief period during the *[Reconquista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista "Reconquista")*, ruling the [Principality of Valencia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordship_of_Valencia "Lordship of Valencia") from 17 June 1094 until his death in 1099. His wife, [Jimena Díaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimena_D%C3%ADaz "Jimena Díaz"), inherited the city and maintained it until 1102 when it was reconquered by the Moors.

Díaz de Vivar became well known for his service in the armies of both Christian and Muslim rulers. After his death, El Cid became Spain's most celebrated national hero and the protagonist of the most significant medieval Spanish epic poem, *[El Cantar de mio Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantar_de_mio_Cid "Cantar de mio Cid")*,[^1] which presents him as the ideal medieval knight: strong, valiant, loyal, just, and pious.

There are various theories on his family history, which remains uncertain; however, he was the grandfather of [García Ramírez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garc%C3%ADa_Ram%C3%ADrez_of_Navarre "García Ramírez of Navarre") de Pamplona, King of Navarre, and the first son of his daughter [Cristina Rodríguez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Rodr%C3%ADguez_\(noble\) "Cristina Rodríguez (noble)"). To this day, El Cid remains a popular Spanish folk hero and national icon, with his life and deeds remembered in popular culture.[^2] [^3]

Here on the penultimate and final line of the document's text appears the autograph of Rodrigo Díaz: « ego ruderico, simul cum coniuge mea, afirmo oc quod superius scriptum est. » This translates as "I Rodrigo, together with my wife, affirm that which is written above."

Rodrigo Díaz was recognized with the honorary title *Campeador* during his lifetime, as is evidenced by a document that he signed in 1098, which he signed in the Latinized expression, *ego Rudericus Campidoctor*. The title *Campeador* comes from the Latin *Campidoctor*, literally meaning "Teacher of the Field", but translatable as "Master of the Battlefield". Arabic sources from the late 11th century and early 12th century call him الكنبيطور (*al-Kanbīṭūr*), القنبيطور (*al-Qanbīṭūr*), also preceded by *Rudrīq* or *Ludrīq*, which are Arabized forms of his title and name, respectively.[^4]

The epithet *El Cid* meant "the Lord", probably from the original Arabic (السَّيِّد, *as- [Sayyid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid "Sayyid")*), and was a title given to other Christian leaders. It has been conjectured that Rodrigo Díaz received the honorific title and respectful treatment of contemporaries in [Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaragoza "Zaragoza") because of his victories in the service of the King of the Taifa of Zaragoza between 1081 and 1086; however, he more likely received the epithet after his conquest of Valencia in 1094. This title appears for the first time as *Meo Çidi* in the *Poema de Almería*, composed between 1147 and 1149.[^5] [^6]

The combination of *Cid Campeador* is documented from 1195 in *Linaje de Rodrigo Díaz* ("The Lineage of Rodrigo Díaz") in Navarro-Aragonese, which form part of the *Liber regum* written as *mio Cit el Campiador*; and in *El Cantar de mio Cid*.[^7]

Born a member of the minor nobility, El Cid was brought up at the court of [Ferdinand the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_the_Great "Ferdinand the Great") and served Ferdinand's son, [Sancho II of León and Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_II_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Sancho II of León and Castile"). He rose to become the commander and royal standard-bearer (*armiger regis*) of [Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Castile "Kingdom of Castile") upon Sancho's ascension in 1065. El Cid went on to lead the Castilian military campaigns against Sancho's brothers, [Alfonso VI of León](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_VI_of_Le%C3%B3n "Alfonso VI of León") and [García II of Galicia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garc%C3%ADa_II_of_Galicia "García II of Galicia"), as well as in the Muslim kingdoms in [al-Andalus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"). He became renowned for his military prowess in these campaigns, which helped expand the territory of the Crown of Castile at the expense of the Muslims and Sancho's brothers' kingdoms.

When conspirators murdered Sancho in 1072, El Cid found himself in a difficult situation. Since Sancho was childless, the throne passed to his brother Alfonso, whom El Cid had helped remove from power. Although El Cid continued to serve the sovereign, he lost his ranking in the new court, which treated him suspiciously and kept him at arm's length. Finally, in 1081, he was exiled.[^8]

El Cid found work fighting for the [Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") rulers of [Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Zaragoza "Taifa of Zaragoza"), whom he defended from its traditional enemy, [Aragon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aragon "Kingdom of Aragon"). While in exile, he regained his reputation as a strategist and formidable military leader. He was repeatedly victorious in battle against the Muslim rulers of [Lérida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9rida "Lérida") and their Christian allies, as well as against a large Christian army under King [Sancho Ramírez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_Ram%C3%ADrez "Sancho Ramírez") of Aragon. In 1086, an expeditionary army of [North African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa") [Almoravids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravids "Almoravids") inflicted a severe defeat to Castile, compelling Alfonso to overcome the resentment he harboured against El Cid. The terms for El Cid's return to Christian service must have been attractive enough since El Cid soon found himself fighting for his former lord. Over the next several years, however, El Cid set his sights on the kingdom city of [Valencia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia "Valencia"), operating more or less independently of Alfonso while politically supporting the [Banu Hud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hud "Banu Hud") and other Muslim dynasties opposed to the Almoravids. He gradually increased his control over Valencia; the Islamic ruler, [Yahya al-Qadir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_al-Qadir "Yahya al-Qadir"), became his tributary in 1092. When the Almoravids instigated an uprising that resulted in the death of al-Qadir, El Cid responded by laying siege to the city. Valencia finally fell in 1094, and El Cid established an independent principality on the Mediterranean coast of Iberia. He ruled over a [pluralistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_pluralism "Cultural pluralism") society with the popular support of Christians and Muslims alike.[^9]

El Cid's final years were spent fighting the Almoravid [Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers"). He inflicted upon them their first major defeat in 1094, on the plains of Caurte, outside Valencia, and continued opposing them until his death. Although El Cid remained undefeated in Valencia, Diego Rodríguez, his only son and heir, died fighting against the Almoravids in the service of Alfonso in 1097. After El Cid died in 1099, his wife, [Jimena Díaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimena_D%C3%ADaz "Jimena Díaz"), succeeded him as ruler of Valencia, but she was eventually forced to surrender the principality to the Almoravids in 1102.[^10]

First paragraph of the *[Carmen Campidoctoris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Campidoctoris "Carmen Campidoctoris")*, the earliest literary treatment of El Cid's life, written to celebrate El Cid's defeat of some counts and champions

The name *El Cid* (Spanish:[\[elˈθið\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Spanish "Help:IPA/Spanish")) is a modern Spanish denomination composed of the article *el* meaning "the" and *Cid*, which derives from the Old Castilian loan word *Çid* borrowed from the dialectal Arabic word سيد *[sîdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi "Sidi")* or [sayyid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid "Sayyid"), which means "lord" or "master". The [Mozarabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozarabs "Mozarabs") or the Arabs that served in his ranks may have addressed him in this way, which the Christians may have transliterated and adopted. Historians, however, have not yet found contemporary records referring to Rodrigo as *Cid.* Arab sources use instead *Rudriq*, *Ludriq al-Kanbiyatur* or *al-Qanbiyatur* (*Rodrigo el Campeador*).[^11]

The cognomen *Campeador* derives from Latin *campi doctor,* which means "battlefield master". He probably gained it during the campaigns of [King Sancho II of Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_II_of_Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n "Sancho II of Castile and León") against his brothers, kings [Alfonso VI of León](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_VI_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Alfonso VI of León and Castile") and [García II of Galicia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garc%C3%ADa_II_of_Galicia "García II of Galicia"). While his contemporaries left no historical sources that would have addressed him as *Cid*, they left plenty of Christian and Arab records, some even signed documents with his autograph, addressing him as *Campeador*, which prove that he used the Christian cognomen himself.[^12] [^13] [^14] [^15] The whole combination *Cid Campeador* is first documented c. 1195 in the [Navarro-Aragonese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro-Aragonese "Navarro-Aragonese") *[Linage de Rodric Díaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linage_de_Rodric_D%C3%ADaz&action=edit&redlink=1 "Linage de Rodric Díaz (page does not exist)")* included in the *Liber Regum* under the formula *mio Cid el Campeador*.

Northern Iberian Peninsula under the rule of [Urraca, called **the Reckless** (*la Temeraria*)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urraca_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Urraca of León and Castile") Queen of [León](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n "Kingdom of León"), [Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Castile "Kingdom of Castile") and [Galicia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Galicia "Kingdom of Galicia") from 1109 until her death.

El Cid was born Rodrigo Díaz circa 1043 in [Vivar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivar_del_Cid "Vivar del Cid"),[^16] also known as Castillona de Bivar, a small town about ten kilometers (or six miles) north of [Burgos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos "Burgos"), the capital of [Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Castile "Kingdom of Castile"). His father, Diego Laínez, was a [courtier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_court "Noble court"), [bureaucrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy "Bureaucracy"), and [cavalryman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry "Cavalry") who had fought in several battles. Despite the fact that El Cid's mother's family was aristocratic, in later years, the peasants would consider him one of their own. However, his relatives were not major court officials; documents show that El Cid's paternal grandfather, Laín, confirmed only five documents of [Ferdinand I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Ferdinand I of León and Castile") 's; his maternal grandfather, Rodrigo Álvarez, certified only two of [Sancho II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_II_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Sancho II of León and Castile") 's; and El Cid's father confirmed only one.

As a young man in 1057, El Cid fought against the Moorish stronghold of [Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Zaragoza "Taifa of Zaragoza"), making its [emir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir "Emir") [al-Muqtadir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_al-Muqtadir "Ahmad al-Muqtadir") a vassal of Sancho. In the spring of 1063, El Cid fought in the [Battle of Graus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Graus "Battle of Graus"), where Ferdinand's half-brother, [Ramiro I of Aragon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiro_I_of_Aragon "Ramiro I of Aragon"), was laying siege to the Moorish town of Graus, which was fought on Zaragozan lands in the valley of the [river Cinca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinca_\(Spain\) "Cinca (Spain)"). Al-Muqtadir, accompanied by Castilian troops including El Cid, fought against the Aragonese. The party slew Ramiro I, setting the Aragonese army on the run, and emerged victorious. One legend has said that during the conflict, El Cid killed an Aragonese knight in single combat, thereby receiving the honorific title " *Campeador* ".[^17]

When Ferdinand died, Sancho continued to enlarge his territory, conquering both Christian strongholds and the [Moorish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish "Moorish") cities of [Zamora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamora,_Spain "Zamora, Spain") and [Badajoz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badajoz "Badajoz"). When Sancho learned that Alfonso was planning on overthrowing him in order to gain his territory, Sancho sent Cid to bring Alfonso back so that Sancho could speak to him.

Marcos Giráldez de Acosta painting (1864) depicting the " [Santa Gadea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Gadea "Santa Gadea") Oath". In the middle of the scene, [Alfonso VI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_VI_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Alfonso VI of León and Castile") (with red cape) is swearing with his right hand on the [Bible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible") that he did not take part in the murder of his brother [Sancho II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_II_of_Castile "Sancho II of Castile"), while El Cid stands as a witness in front of him.

Sancho was assassinated in 1072, during a siege of his sister's town of Zamora.[^18] Since Sancho died unmarried and childless, all of his power passed to his brother Alfonso who, almost immediately, returned from exile in [Toledo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Spain "Toledo, Spain") and took his seat as king of Castile and León. He was, however, deeply suspected of having been involved in Sancho's murder. According to the 11th century epic poem *[Cantar de mio Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantar_de_mio_Cid "Cantar de mio Cid")*, the Castilian nobility led by El Cid and a dozen "oath-helpers" forced Alfonso to [swear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath "Oath") publicly on holy relics multiple times in front of [Santa Gadea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Gadea "Santa Gadea") ([Saint Agatha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Agatha "Saint Agatha")) Church in [Burgos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos "Burgos") that he did not participate in the plot to kill his brother. This is not mentioned in the more reliable 12th century chronicle *[Historia Roderici](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Roderici "Historia Roderici")*, however. El Cid's position as *armiger regis* was taken away and given to his enemy, Count [García Ordóñez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garc%C3%ADa_Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez "García Ordóñez").[^19]

In 1079, El Cid was sent by Alfonso VI to [Seville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville "Seville") to the court of [al-Mutamid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mu%27tamid_ibn_Abbad "Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad") to collect the *[parias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parias "Parias")* owed by that *[taifa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa "Taifa")* to León–Castile.[^20] While he was there Granada, assisted by other Castilian knights, attacked Seville, and El Cid and his forces repulsed the Christian and Grenadine attackers at the [Battle of Cabra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cabra "Battle of Cabra"), in the (probably mistaken) belief that he was defending the king's tributary. During the aftermath of this battle the Muslim troops under El Cid's command would hail him as Sayyidi.[^21] Count García Ordóñez and the other Castilian leaders [^22] were taken captive and held for three days before being released.[^20]

In the [Battle of Cabra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cabra "Battle of Cabra") (1079), El Cid rallied his troops and turned the battle into a rout of Emir Abdullah of [Granada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada "Granada") and his ally García Ordóñez. This unauthorized expedition into Granada, however, greatly angered Alfonso and May 8, 1080, was the last time El Cid confirmed a document in King Alfonso's court. The most likely reason was El Cid's incursion into Toledo, which happened to be under the control of Alfonso's vassal, Yahya Al-Qadir.[^23] Alfonso's anger over El Cid's unsanctioned incursion into his vassal's territory would lead him to exile the knight.[^24] This is the generally accepted reason for the exile of El Cid, although several others are plausible and indeed may have been contributing factors to the exile: jealous nobles turning Alfonso against El Cid through court intrigue, and Alfonso's own personal animosity towards El Cid. The song of El Cid and subsequent tales state that Alfonso's and his court's animosity toward Rodrigo was the primary reason the expulsion of the knights from León,[^25] as well as a possible misappropriation of some of the tribute from Seville by El Cid.

At first he went to [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"), where [Ramon Berenguer II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Berenguer_II,_Count_of_Barcelona "Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona") refused his offer of service.

During his service to the [Taifa of Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Zaragoza "Taifa of Zaragoza"), he had gained a prominent reputation and the title *El Cid* (the lord). He is also known to have developed links with the other [Taifas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifas "Taifas") in 1080.

The exile was not the end of El Cid, either physically or as an important figure. After being rejected by [Ramon Berenguer II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Berenguer_II,_Count_of_Barcelona "Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona"), El Cid journeyed to the [Taifa of Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Zaragoza "Taifa of Zaragoza"), where he received a warmer welcome. In 1081, El Cid went on to offer his services to the king of [Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaragoza "Zaragoza"), [Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_al-Mu%27taman_ibn_Hud "Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud"), and served both him and his successor, [al-Musta'in II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Musta%27in_II "Al-Musta'in II"). He was given the title *El Cid* (*The Master*) and served as a leading figure in a diverse Moorish force consisting of [Muwallads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muwallad "Muwallad"), [Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people"), [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab"), and [Malians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali "Mali") within the respective Taifa.

According to Moorish accounts:

> [Andalusi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") [Knights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight "Knight") found El Cid their foe ill, thirsty and exiled from the court of [Alfonso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_VI_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile "Alfonso VI of León and Castile"), he was presented before the elderly [Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_al-Mu%27taman_ibn_Hud "Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud") and accepted command of the forces of the [Taifa of Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Zaragoza "Taifa of Zaragoza") as their Master.

In his *History of Medieval Spain* (Cornell University Press, 1975), Joseph F. O'Callaghan writes:

> That kingdom was divided between [al-Mutamin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_al-Mu%27taman_ibn_Hud "Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud") (1081–1085) who ruled [Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaragoza "Zaragoza") proper, and his brother [al-Mundhir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundhir_al-Hajib "Mundhir al-Hajib"), who ruled [Lérida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Lleida "Taifa of Lleida") and [Tortosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortosa "Tortosa"). El Cid entered al-Mutamin's service and successfully defended Zaragoza against the assaults of al-Mundhir, [Sancho I of Aragón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_I_of_Arag%C3%B3n "Sancho I of Aragón"), and Ramon Berenguer II, whom he held captive briefly in 1082.

In 1082, the army of the [Taifa of Zaragoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Zaragoza "Taifa of Zaragoza") under El Cid defeated the [Taifa of Lleida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Lleida "Taifa of Lleida") at the [Battle of Almenar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Almenar_\(1082\) "Battle of Almenar (1082)"). In 1084, he defeated the [Aragonese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragon "Aragon") at the [Battle of Morella](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Morella "Battle of Morella") near [Tortosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortosa "Tortosa"), but in autumn the Castilians started a loose siege of [Toledo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Spain "Toledo, Spain") and later the next year the Christians captured [Salamanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamanca "Salamanca"), a stronghold of the [Taifa of Toledo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taifa_of_Toledo "Taifa of Toledo").

In 1086, the [Almoravid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty") invasion of the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula"), through and around [Gibraltar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar "Gibraltar"), began. The Almoravids, a [Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people") dynasty from [North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa"), led by [Yusuf ibn Tashfin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_ibn_Tashfin "Yusuf ibn Tashfin"), were asked to help defend the divided Moors from Alfonso. The Almoravid army, joined by that of several Taifas, including [Badajoz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badajoz "Badajoz"), [Málaga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga "Málaga"), [Granada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada "Granada"), [Tortosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortosa "Tortosa") and [Seville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville "Seville"), defeated a combined army of [León](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Le%C3%B3n "Kingdom of León"), [Aragón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aragon "Kingdom of Aragon"), and [Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Castile "Kingdom of Castile") at the [Battle of Sagrajas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sagrajas "Battle of Sagrajas").[^26]

In 1087, [Raymond of Burgundy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_of_Burgundy "Raymond of Burgundy") and his Christian allies attempted to weaken the Taifa of Zaragoza's northernmost stronghold by initiating the [Siege of Tudela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tudela "Siege of Tudela") and Alfonso captured [Aledo, Murcia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aledo,_Murcia "Aledo, Murcia"), blocking the route between the Taifas in the eastern and western Iberian Peninsula.

[Battle of Cuarte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cuarte "Battle of Cuarte") (21 October 1094). El Cid's troops are in green, [Almoravid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid "Almoravid") troops are in red.

Terrified after his crushing defeat, Alfonso recalled El Cid, rewarding him lavishly with lands and lordships, such as the fortress of Gormaz. In the year 1087 Alfonso sent him to negotiate with the emboldened Taifa kingdoms.[^27]

El Cid returned to Alfonso, but now he had his own plans. He only stayed a short while and then returned to Zaragoza. El Cid was content to let the Almoravid armies and the armies of Alfonso fight without his help, even when there was a chance that the Almoravids might defeat Alfonso and take over all of Alfonso's lands. El Cid chose not to fight because he was hoping that both armies would weaken themselves.

Around this time, El Cid, with a combined Christian and Moorish army, began maneuvering in order to create his own fief in the Moorish [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean") coastal city of [Valencia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia "Valencia"). Several obstacles lay in his way. First was Berenguer Ramon II, who ruled nearby [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"). In May 1090, El Cid defeated and captured Berenguer in the Battle of Tébar (nowadays Pinar de Tévar, near [Monroyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroyo "Monroyo"), [Teruel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Teruel "Province of Teruel")). Berenguer was later released and his nephew Ramon Berenguer III married El Cid's youngest daughter Maria to ward against future conflicts.

Along the way to Valencia, El Cid also conquered other towns, many of which were near Valencia, such as [El Puig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Puig "El Puig") and [Quart de Poblet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quart_de_Poblet "Quart de Poblet").

El Cid gradually came to have more influence in Valencia, then ruled by [Yahya al-Qadir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_al-Qadir "Yahya al-Qadir"), of the [Hawwara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawwara "Hawwara") Berber [Dhulnunid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhulnunid_dynasty "Dhulnunid dynasty"). In October 1092 an uprising occurred in Valencia, inspired by the city's chief judge Ibn Jahhaf and the Almoravids. El Cid began a siege of Valencia. A December 1093 attempt to break the siege failed. By the time the siege ended in May 1094, El Cid had carved out his own principality on the coast of the Mediterranean. Officially, El Cid ruled in the name of Alfonso; in practice, El Cid was fully independent. The city was both Christian and Muslim, and both Moors and Christians served in the army and as administrators. [Jerome of Périgord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_of_P%C3%A9rigord "Jerome of Périgord") was made bishop.

[Tomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb "Tomb") of El Cid and his wife Doña Jimena at the [Burgos Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos_Cathedral "Burgos Cathedral")

El Cid and his wife [Jimena Díaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimena_D%C3%ADaz "Jimena Díaz") lived peacefully in Valencia until the Almoravids besieged the city. But he defeated them and died 5 years later, on July 10, 1099.

Afterward Valencia was captured by [Mazdali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdali_ibn_Tilankan "Mazdali ibn Tilankan") on May 5, 1102. Jimena fled to Burgos, Castile, in 1101. She rode into the town with her retinue and the body of El Cid. Originally buried in Castile in the monastery of [San Pedro de Cardeña](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_de_Carde%C3%B1a "San Pedro de Cardeña"), his body now lies at the center of [Burgos Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos_Cathedral "Burgos Cathedral").[^28]

After his demise, but still during the siege of Valencia, legend holds that Jimena ordered that the corpse of El Cid be fitted with his armor and set on his horse, Babieca, to bolster the morale of his troops. In several variations of the story, the dead Rodrigo and his knights win a thundering charge against Valencia's besiegers, resulting in a war-is-lost-but-battle-is-won [catharsis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis "Catharsis") for generations of Christian Spaniards to follow. It is believed that the legend originated shortly after Jimena entered Burgos, and that it is derived from the manner in which Jimena's procession rode into the city, i.e. alongside her deceased husband.[^29]

During his campaigns, El Cid often ordered that books by classic [Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") and [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_literature "Greek literature") authors on military themes be read aloud to him and his troops, for both entertainment and inspiration before battle. El Cid's army had a novel approach to planning strategy as well, holding what might be called " [brainstorming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming "Brainstorming") " sessions before each battle to discuss tactics. They frequently used unexpected strategies, engaging in what modern generals would call [psychological warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare "Psychological warfare") —waiting for the enemy to be paralyzed with terror and then attacking them suddenly; distracting the enemy with a small group of soldiers, etc. (El Cid used this distraction in capturing the town of Castejón as depicted in *[Cantar de mio Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantar_de_mio_Cid "Cantar de mio Cid")* (*The Song of my Cid*).) El Cid accepted or included suggestions from his troops. In *The Song* the man who served him as his closest adviser was his vassal and kinsman [Álvar Fáñez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvar_F%C3%A1%C3%B1ez "Álvar Fáñez") " *Minaya* " (meaning *"My brother"*, a compound word of Spanish possessive *Mi* (My) and *Anaia*, the basque word for *brother*), although the historical Álvar Fáñez remained in Castile with Alfonso VI.

Tomb of Babieca at the monastery of [San Pedro de Cardeña](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_de_Carde%C3%B1a "San Pedro de Cardeña")

**Babieca**, or **Bavieca**, was El Cid's [warhorse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhorse "Warhorse"). Several stories exist about El Cid and Babieca. One well-known legend about El Cid describes how he acquired the [stallion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion "Stallion"). According to this story, Rodrigo's godfather, Pedro El Grande, was a monk at a [Carthusian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthusian "Carthusian") [monastery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery "Monastery"). Pedro's coming-of-age gift to El Cid was his pick of a horse from an [Andalusian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_horse "Andalusian horse") herd. El Cid picked a horse that his godfather thought was a weak, poor choice, causing the monk to exclaim " *Babieca!*" (stupid!). Hence, it became the name of El Cid's horse. Another legend states that in a competition of battle to become King Sancho's "Campeador", or champion, a knight on horseback wished to challenge El Cid. The King wished a fair fight and gave El Cid his finest horse, Babieca, or Bavieca. This version says Babieca was raised in the royal stables of Seville and was a highly trained and loyal war horse, not a foolish stallion. The name in this instance could suggest that the horse came from the Babia region in [León, Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3n_\(historical_region\) "León (historical region)"). In the poem *[Carmen Campidoctoris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Campidoctoris "Carmen Campidoctoris")*, Babieca appears as a gift from "a barbarian" to El Cid, so its name could also be derived from "Barbieca", or "horse of the barbarian".[^30]

Regardless, Babieca became a great warhorse, famous to the Christians, feared by El Cid's enemies, and loved by El Cid, who allegedly requested that Babieca be buried with him in the monastery of [San Pedro de Cardeña](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_de_Carde%C3%B1a "San Pedro de Cardeña").[^9] Babieca is mentioned in several tales and historical documents about El Cid, including *The Lay of El Cid*.[^31]

A weapon traditionally identified as El Cid's [sword](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword "Sword"), [Tizona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizona "Tizona"), used to be displayed in the Army Museum (Museo del Ejército) in Toledo. In 1999, a small sample of the blade underwent metallurgical analysis which confirmed that the blade was made in Moorish [Córdoba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Spain "Córdoba, Spain") in the eleventh century and contained amounts of [Damascus steel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel "Damascus steel").[^32]

In 2007, the Autonomous Community of [Castile and León](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n "Castile and León") bought the sword for €1.6 million,[^33] and it is currently on display at the Museum of [Burgos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos "Burgos").[^34]

El Cid also had a sword called [Colada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colada "Colada").[^35]

El Cid depicted on the title page of a 16th-century working of his story

El Cid married [Jimena Díaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimena_D%C3%ADaz "Jimena Díaz"), who was said to be part of an aristocratic family from Asturias, in the mid-1070s.[^36] The *[Historia Roderici](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Roderici "Historia Roderici")* calls her a daughter of a Count [Diego Fernández de Oviedo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Oviedo "Diego Fernández de Oviedo"). Tradition states that when El Cid first laid eyes on her, he was enamoured of her great beauty. El Cid and Jimena had two daughters, Cristina and María, and a son. The latter, [Diego Rodríguez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Rodr%C3%ADguez_\(Son_of_El_Cid\) "Diego Rodríguez (Son of El Cid)"), was killed while fighting against the invading Muslim Almoravids from [North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa") at the [Battle of Consuegra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Consuegra "Battle of Consuegra") in 1097. El Cid's daughters [Cristina Rodríguez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Rodr%C3%ADguez_\(noble\) "Cristina Rodríguez (noble)") and [María](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Rodr%C3%ADguez_de_Vivar "María Rodríguez de Vivar") both married into noble families. Cristina married [Ramiro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiro_S%C3%A1nchez,_Lord_of_Monz%C3%B3n "Ramiro Sánchez, Lord of Monzón"), Lord of [Monzón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monz%C3%B3n "Monzón") and grandson of [García Sánchez III of Navarre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garc%C3%ADa_S%C3%A1nchez_III_of_Navarre "García Sánchez III of Navarre").

Her own son, El Cid's grandson, would be elevated to the throne of [Navarre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Navarre "Kingdom of Navarre") as King [García Ramírez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garc%C3%ADa_Ram%C3%ADrez_of_Navarre "García Ramírez of Navarre"). The other daughter, [María](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Rodr%C3%ADguez_de_Vivar "María Rodríguez de Vivar") (also known as Sol), is said first to have married a prince of Aragon, presumably the son of [Peter I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_of_Aragon_and_Pamplona "Peter I of Aragon and Pamplona"), and she later married [Ramon Berenguer III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Berenguer_III,_Count_of_Barcelona "Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona"), count of [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"). Both the poem and the chronicle may state a previous marriage to the [infantes de Carrión](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infantes_de_Carri%C3%B3n&action=edit&redlink=1 "Infantes de Carrión (page does not exist)"); however, these marriages are not a historical fact and are an important element in the construction of the poem.[^37]

The figure of El Cid has been the source for many literary works, beginning with the *[Cantar de mio Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantar_de_mio_Cid "Cantar de mio Cid")*, an [epic poem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poem "Epic poem") from the 12th century which gives a partly-fictionalized account of his life, and was one of the early [chivalric romances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance "Chivalric romance"). This poem, along with similar later works such as the *[Mocedades de Rodrigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocedades_de_Rodrigo "Mocedades de Rodrigo")*, contributed to portray El Cid as a chivalric hero of the Reconquista,[^38] making him a legendary figure in Spain. El Cid is one of the few examples of knight errantry formally recognized by the priest in [Miguel de Cervantes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes "Miguel de Cervantes") 's *[Don Quixote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote "Don Quixote")* (1605–1615).[^39]

In the early 17th century, the Spanish writer [Guillén de Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guill%C3%A9n_de_Castro_y_Bellvis "Guillén de Castro y Bellvis") wrote a play called *Las Mocedades del Cid*, on which French playwright [Pierre Corneille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Corneille "Pierre Corneille") based one of his most famous tragicomedies, *[Le Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cid "Le Cid")*.[^40] He was also a popular source of inspiration for Spanish writers of the [Romantic period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "Romanticism"), such as [Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Eugenio_Hartzenbusch "Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch"), who wrote *La Jura de Santa Gadea*, or [José Zorrilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Zorrilla "José Zorrilla"), who wrote a long poem called *La Leyenda del Cid*. In 2019, [Arturo Pérez-Reverte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_P%C3%A9rez-Reverte "Arturo Pérez-Reverte") published the novel entitled *Sidi: Un relato de frontera*.[^41] [^42]

[Herman Melville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville "Herman Melville") references El Cid when introducing the character of Samoa in Chapter 21 of *[Mardi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi "Mardi")* (1849): "He alighted about six paces from where we stood, and balancing his weapon, eyed us bravely as the Cid".[^43]

In 1929, Chilean writer [Vicente Huidobro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Huidobro "Vicente Huidobro") published his poetic novel *Mío Cid Campeador. Hazaña.* This work, together with other novels (and plays) he published between 1929 and 1939, defied the traditional realistic style of the early 20th century Chilean novel. The English version was published in 1931.[^44]

[Georges Bizet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Bizet "Georges Bizet") worked on *Don Rodrigue* in 1873 that was set aside and never completed. [Jules Massenet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Massenet "Jules Massenet") wrote an opera, *[Le Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cid_\(opera\) "Le Cid (opera)")*, in 1885, based on Corneille's play of the same name. [Claude Debussy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy "Claude Debussy") began work in 1890 on an opera, *[Rodrigue et Chimène](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigue_et_Chim%C3%A8ne "Rodrigue et Chimène")*, which he abandoned as unsuitable for his temperament; it was orchestrated for performance by [Edison Denisov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Denisov "Edison Denisov") circa 1993.[^45]

El Cid is portrayed by American actor [Charlton Heston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Heston "Charlton Heston") in a 1961 [epic film of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid_\(film\) "El Cid (film)") [^46] directed by [Anthony Mann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mann "Anthony Mann"), where the character of Doña Ximena is portrayed by Italian actress [Sophia Loren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren "Sophia Loren").[^47] [^48] In 2020, [Amazon Prime Video](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video "Amazon Prime Video") premiered a [Spanish TV series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid_\(TV_series\) "El Cid (TV series)") with [Jaime Lorente](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Lorente "Jaime Lorente") starring as *El Cid*.[^49]

In 1979, [Crack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_\(band\) "Crack (band)"), one of the most prominent progressive rock bands from Spain, released their first and only album *Si Todo Hiciera Crack* including "Marchando una del Cid", a song based on the epic legend of El Cid.[^50]

In 1980, *[Ruy, the Little Cid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy,_the_Little_Cid "Ruy, the Little Cid")* was an [animated series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime "Anime") based on El Cid's childhood made by [Nippon Animation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Animation "Nippon Animation").[^51]

El Cid was described to inspire Ferny about his Spanish heritage in "The Legend of Raloo", episode 16 of season 1 of *[Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakers!_The_Adventures_of_Piggley_Winks "Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks")* in 2004.[^52]

In the second *[Age of Empires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires "Age of Empires")* video game installment, *[The Conquerors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_The_Conquerors "Age of Empires II: The Conquerors")* expansion pack, there is a campaign starring El Cid Campeador.[^53] [^54]

In both the first and second *[Medieval: Total War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval:_Total_War "Medieval: Total War")* games, El Cid appears as a powerful independent general in the castle of Valencia.[^55]

In 2003, the Spanish animated film *[El Cid: The Legend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid:_The_Legend "El Cid: The Legend")* was released.[^56]

*[The Ministry of Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_ministerio_del_tiempo "El ministerio del tiempo")*, a Spanish science fiction television series, portrayed El Cid in season 2, episode 1.[^57]

El Cid is a playable character in the Mobile/PC Game [Rise of Kingdoms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_Kingdoms "Rise of Kingdoms").

El Cid is a playable character in *[Crusader Kings II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_II "Crusader Kings II")* and Crusader Kings III in start dates corresponding to his historical rule over Valencia.
