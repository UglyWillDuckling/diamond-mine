> Huxley's classic prophetic novel describes the socialized horrors of a<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> futuristic utopia devoid of individual freedom</mark>.

This classic novel of a perfectly engineered society is ‚Äúone of the most prophetic dystopian works of the twentieth century‚Äù (The Wall Street Journal).
Half a millennium from now, in the World State, the watchword is that every one belongs to every one else. No matter what class of human you are bred to be‚Äîfrom the intellectual Alphas to the Epsilons who provide the manual labor‚Äîyou are a part of the efficient, well-oiled whole. You are nourished, secure, and blissfully serene thanks to the freely distributed drug called **soma**. And while sex is strongly encouraged, ==the old way of procreation is forbidden==, eliminating even the pains of childbirth. 

But when a man and woman journey beyond these confines to where the ‚Äúsavages‚Äù reside, and bring back two outsiders, the cracks begin to show.

Named as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the twentieth century by the Modern Library,   


Brave New World is one of the first truly dystopian novels. Influenced by the historic events of Huxley‚Äôs era yet as relevant today as ever, it is a remarkable depiction of the conflict between progress and the human spirit.
