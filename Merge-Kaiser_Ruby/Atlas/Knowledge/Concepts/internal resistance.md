**Ri** typically stands for internal resistance of a power source like a battery or generator.

It represents the resistance within the source that opposes the flow of current.

In circuit diagrams, it's often modeled as a small resistor in series with the ideal voltage source.


**Example**:

If a battery has a voltage of 12V and an internal resistance of 0.5 ohms, when you draw current from it, the terminal voltage drops depending on the current:

V_terminal = V_source - I × Ri

So the higher the current, the more voltage you "lose" across Ri.


# Maximum Power Transfer Theorem:

To transfer the maximum power from a source (like a battery or generator) to a load (like a resistor, motor, etc.), the load resistance (Rₗ) **must be equal to the internal resistance (Ri**) of the source.

Condition for Maximum Power:

$$ Ri = Rl $$

What Happens:

If : More current flows, but power is wasted in the source — not efficient.

If : Less current flows — not enough power delivered.

If : Sweet spot — maximum power is delivered to the load.

Power Delivered to the Load:

$$P = \frac{V^2}{4R_i}$$
