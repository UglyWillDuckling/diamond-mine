**Miljenko** " **Dino** " **Dvornik** (pronounced [\[dǐːnodʋôːrnik\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Serbo-Croatian "Help:IPA/Serbo-Croatian"); 20 August 1964 – 7 September 2008), was a [Croatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia "Croatia") musician, music producer, actor and [reality television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television "Reality television") star. Often referred to by the nickname "Kralj funka" ("King of [Funk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk "Funk") "),[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] Dvornik was a highly popular act in [Croatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music_in_Croatia "Popular music in Croatia") and [Yugoslav popular music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music_in_Yugoslavia "Popular music in Yugoslavia").

Son of renowned actor [Boris Dvornik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Dvornik "Boris Dvornik"), Dino Dvornik appeared as a [child actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_actor "Child actor") in several Yugoslav films and television series, before starting his musical career in the funk [[band Kineski Zid]], which he formed with his brother [[Dean Dvornik]] in 1982. The group split up after releasing only one album, with Dino deciding to start a career as solo artist. His [self-titled debut album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_Dvornik_\(album\) "Dino Dvornik (album)") was released in 1989, gaining commercial success and critical acclaim with its funk and [soul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music "Soul music") sound. His following studio album *[Kreativni nered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreativni_nered "Kreativni nered")*, released in 1990, maintained his large mainstream popularity in Yugoslavia. However, the outbreak of the [Yugoslav Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars "Yugoslav Wars") brought discontinuity in his career. During the 1990s and early 2000s, he recorded four more studio albums, all of them being well-received by critics and the general public.

Dvornik died in 2008 after overdosing on a mixture of [sleeping pills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_pills "Sleeping pills"), [analgesics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic "Analgesic") and [antidepressants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant "Antidepressant"). His eighth and last studio album *[Pandorina kutija](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandorina_kutija "Pandorina kutija")* was released posthumously during the same year and was followed by a number of tributes to Dvornik by artists from Croatia and former Yugoslav region.

A son of renowned actor [Boris Dvornik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Dvornik "Boris Dvornik") and mother Diana Dvornik (née Tomić), Dino was born Miljenko Dvornik on 20 August 1964 in the city of [Split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia "Split, Croatia"), at that time within [Yugoslav](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia") republic of [Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Croatia "Socialist Republic of Croatia").[^5] He would play alongside his father in 1970s Yugoslav films and TV series,[^5] including the films *[Daredevil's Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil%27s_Time "Daredevil's Time")* (1977) and *[Across the Blue Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Blue_Sea "Across the Blue Sea")* (1979), and the TV series *Naše malo misto* (*Our Small Town*, 1970–1971) and *Čovik i po* (*A Man and a Half*, 1974).[^6]

Dino Dvornik had his musical debut in the early 1980s, recording the [7-inch single](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-inch_single "7-inch single") "Mille non pieu mille" / "Pižolot" with his father.[^5] Simultaneously, he formed the band Kineski Zid (*[Great Wall of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China")*) with his brother Dean Dvornik.[^5] They chose the name for the band after a nickname for the Split building in which the Dvornik family lived at that time.[^5] The band performed funk music, releasing their self-titled debut album in 1983.[^5] The album songs were composed by Dino, while the lyrics were written by Dean Dvornik.[^5] The album saw little commercial and critical success, and Kineski Zid disbanded soon after its release.[^5]

After Kineski Zid split up, Dean moved to the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), and Dino Dvornik decided to dedicate himself to a career of a solo artist.[^5] He spent several years practicing and composing, living in [London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") for a period of time, before making a successful debut as a solo artist on the 1988 Zagreb Festival.[^5] Dvornik appeared on the festival with the song "Tebi pripadam" ("I Belong to You"), presenting himself with modern funk sound and winning the first prize awarded by the festival jury.[^5] Dvornik's performance was accompanied by dancers, which was not in accordance with the festival's tradition.[^5]

The initial success provided Dvornik with an opportunity to record his debut studio album.[^5] In Split's Tetrapak studio he recorded his [self-titled debut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_Dvornik_\(album\) "Dino Dvornik (album)"), produced by Dragan Lukić of the band [Đavoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90avoli "Đavoli").[^5] The album songs were composed and [music arrangements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_arrangement "Music arrangement") were written by Dvornik, with most of the album lyrics provided by Goran Kralj, former drummer for the Split band Hangar.[^5] Dvornik recorded vocals, keyboards and percussion on the album tracks.[^5] The album's modern production, [machist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo "Machismo") lyrics and energetic rhythms had large success with the Yugoslav public.[^5] The songs "Ljubav se zove imenom tvojim" ("Love Carries Your Name"), "Ti si mi u mislima" ("You Are in My Thoughts"), "Zašto praviš slona od mene" ("Why Are You Making an Elephant out of Me"), with lyrics for the latter written by [Zlatan Stipišić](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Stipi%C5%A1i%C4%87_Gibonni "Zlatan Stipišić Gibonni"), frontman of the [hard rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock "Hard rock") band [Osmi Putnik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmi_Putnik "Osmi Putnik"), became nationwide hits.[^5] Dvornik promoted the album by performing mostly in Yugoslav [discothèques](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoth%C3%A8que "Discothèque").[^5]

In 1990, on the [MESAM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MESAM&action=edit&redlink=1 "MESAM (page does not exist)") festival he was awarded the first prize by both the jury and the audience for the song "Misliš da sam blesav" ("You Think I'm Crazy").[^5] Later during the year, he released his second studio album *[Kreativni nered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreativni_nered "Kreativni nered")* (*Creative Mess*).[^5] The album's lyrics were written by Zlatan Stipišić, [alternative rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock "Alternative rock") musician [Rambo Amadeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_Amadeus "Rambo Amadeus") and journalist Ozren Kanceljak, and the album featured guest appearances by Đavoli members [Neno Belan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neno_Belan "Neno Belan") and Dragan Lukić.[^5] The album's main hit "Jače manijače" ("Harder, Maniac") was co-written by Dvornik and Rambo Amadeus; their cooperation was started a year earlier, when Dvornik made a guest appearance on Rambo Amadeus album *[Hoćemo gusle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C4%87emo_gusle "Hoćemo gusle")* (*We Want [Gusle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusle "Gusle")*).[^5] The song "Jače manijače" was also released on a [maxi single](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_single "Maxi single"), distributed to discothèques across Yugoslavia.[^5] Unlike Dvornik's previous promotional tour, *Kreativni nered* tour featured a backing band, composed of the members of [Zadar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar "Zadar") band Jet Set.[^5] However, the outbreak of [Yugoslav Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars "Yugoslav Wars") in 1991 interrupted the tour and made a gap in Dvornik's career.[^5]

In 1993, Dvornik released his third studio album, entitled *Priroda & društvo* (*Nature & Society*).[^5] On the recording sessions, Dvornik played guitar, bass guitar and keyboards, and the album also featured [Dragan Lukić Lvky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Luki%C4%87_Lvky "Dragan Lukić Lvky") (keyboards), Zoran Šabijan (keyboards, programming) and Joe Pandur (guitar).[^5] The song "Ying & Yang" featured [Psihomodo Pop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psihomodo_Pop "Psihomodo Pop") frontman [Davor Gobac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davor_Gobac "Davor Gobac") on vocals, and the song "Rušila sam mostove od sna" ("I Was Tearing Down the Bridges made of Dreams") featured singer [Josipa Lisac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josipa_Lisac "Josipa Lisac").[^5] With the songs like "Split Junkie", "Ekstasy" and "The Return of the Man With a Rubber Brain" Dvornik turned towards more serious topics.[^5] However, the album's [techno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno "Techno") sound alienated Dvornik from a part of his old fans, and his [drug abuse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_abuse "Drug abuse") resulted in another hiatus.[^5]

In 1995, he appeared on the [Split Music Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_Music_Festival "Split Music Festival") with the ode to his home city "Ništa kontra Splita" ("Nothing Against Split"), written by Nenad Vilović, winning the first place.[^5] During the same year, he released the live album *Live in Munich*.[^5] The album was recorded on Dvornik's concert in [Munich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich"), [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), on which he was accompanied by the members of the techno group Songkillers.[^5] The following year, he released the maxi single "Afrika" ("Africa"), for which he was awarded the [Porin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porin_\(music_award\) "Porin (music award)") award.[^7]

In 1997, Dvornik released his fourth studio album, the autobiographical *Enfant terrible*.[^8] The album featured guest appearances by Davor Gobac, [Daleka Obala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daleka_Obala "Daleka Obala") frontman [Marijan Ban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijan_Ban "Marijan Ban"), singer [Stjepan "Jimmy" Stanić](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stjepan_Stani%C4%87&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stjepan Stanić (page does not exist)"), Songkillers, and other acts.[^8] Alongside Dvornik's trademark sound, the album also featured his experimentation with different genres in the tracks like "La svraka blues" ("La Crow Blues") and "Male noćne orgulje na plin (a capella)" ("Little Night Gas-Infused [Organ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_\(music\) "Organ (music)") (A Capella)").[^8] The album was produced by Dvornik and was awarded the Porin Best Album Production Award.[^8] The album was followed by the 1998 compilation album *Vidi ove pisme: The Best of Dino Dvornik 1988–1998*, offering the overview of Dvornik's ten-year work, with remixes of some old songs and two previously unreleased tracks – "Dr. lake šetnje" ("PhD in Easy Walking") and "Nema mene" ("I'm Not There").[^8]

Dvornik's fifth studio album, entitled *Big Mamma*, was released in 1999.[^8] The album songs dealt with crime in Croatian capital Zagreb.[^8] The recording of the album lasted over 600 hours.[^8] The songs "Dan bezbrižan" ("Care–Free Day"), "Stojadin" (the title being the Yugoslav nickname for [Zastava 101](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastava_101 "Zastava 101") automobile, featuring lyrics written by Zlatan Stipišić) and [Latin music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_music "Latin music") track "Ća ća ća" ("Cha Cha Cha") became radio hits.[^8] On the [New Year's Eve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve "New Year's Eve") of 2000, Dvornik held a concert in [Belgrade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade "Belgrade"), which was his first performance in [Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia "Serbia") since the dissolution of Yugoslavia.[^8] In 2001, he covered the song "2002 godine u Splitu!" ("In the Year 2002 in Split!"), originally recorded by singer [Oliver Dragojević](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Dragojevi%C4%87 "Oliver Dragojević") in 1975, releasing it as a single.[^8] In 2002, Dvornik released his sixth studio album *Svicky* (a [slang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang "Slang") expression meaning *World-Class*). The album was produced by Davorin Ilić, with the song "Ne znam kome pripadam" ("I Don't Know Who I Belong To") featuring guest appearance by singer Vanda Vinter.[^8]

In his last years, Dvornik would often perform as a [DJ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ "DJ") in various clubs.[^8] Prior to his death, he was working on his seventh studio album, completing most of the album tracks and the video for the first single, "Hipnotiziran" ("Hypnotized").[^8]

In 1989, Dvornik made a guest appearance on [Rambo Amadeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_Amadeus "Rambo Amadeus") album *[Hoćemo gusle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C4%87emo_gusle "Hoćemo gusle")* in the song "Glupi hit" ("A Stupid Hit").[^9] In 1991, he appeared as guest on the album *Ja verujem* (*I Believe*) by rock singer [Viktorija](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktorija_\(singer\) "Viktorija (singer)"), in the duet "Od Splita do Beograda (Ove Noći)" ("From Split to Belgrade (This Night)").[^10] Dvornik composed songs and wrote music arrangements for and produced [Oliver Dragojević](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Dragojevi%C4%87 "Oliver Dragojević") 's 1994 album *Neka nova svitanja* (*Some New Dawns*).[^8] In 2005, he made a guest appearance on the Songkillers album *Sreća* (*Happiness*) in the song "Egzit" ("Exit").[^8] In 2010, he appeared on the album *Veliki umovi 21. stoljeća* (*Great Minds of the 21st Century*) by the [hip hop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop "Hip hop") group [Bolesna Braća](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bolesna_Bra%C4%87a&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bolesna Braća (page does not exist)"), singing in the song "Mali dečko" ("Little Boy").[^8]
