Dick]] *“is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”* And yet how are we to be sure that what we observe actually *is*? After all, so much of what we experience as reality is the product of our [remarkably flawed perception](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/27/on-looking-alexandra-horowitz-interview/).

Some 2,400 years earlier, **[[Plato]]** explored this very question in his famous Allegory of the Cave — perhaps history’s most masterful figurative inquiry into the meaning of life and the nature of reality — found in Book VII of his [***Republic***](https://www.amazon.com/Republic-Plato/dp/0141442433/?tag=braipick-20) ([*free download*](https://www.amazon.com/Republic-Plato-ebook/dp/B0082SV87G/?tag=braipick-20) | [*public library*](http://www.worldcat.org/title/republic/oclc/812576975&referer=brief_results)).

From my friends at [TED-Ed](http://ed.ted.com/) — who have previously given us wonderful animated distillations of [why we love repetition in music](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/18/on-repeat-margulis/), [how to detect lying](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/11/06/language-lying-deception/), [why bees build perfect hexagons](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/01/15/bees-hexagons/), and [how melancholy enhances our creativity](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/11/28/against-happiness-melancholy-wilson/) — comes this elegant synthesis of Plato’s famous parable, its enduring wisdom, and how it illuminates some of the most fundamental questions about the human experience, from the origin of knowledge to the essence of reality itself.
