***Galápagos*** (1985) is the eleventh novel published by American author [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut "Kurt Vonnegut"). Set in the [Galápagos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands "Galápagos Islands") after a global financial disaster, the novel questions the merit of the human brain from an evolutionary perspective. The title is both a reference to the islands on which part of the story plays out, and a tribute to [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin"), on whose theory Vonnegut relies to reach his own conclusions. It was published by [Delacorte Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delacorte_Press "Delacorte Press").

*Galápagos* is the story of a small band of mismatched humans who are shipwrecked on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia in the [Galápagos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands "Galápagos Islands") after a global [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis "Financial crisis") cripples the world's economy. Shortly thereafter, a disease renders all humans on Earth [infertile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility "Infertility"), with the exception of the people on Santa Rosalia, making them the last specimens of humankind. Over the next million years, their descendants, the only fertile humans left on the planet, eventually evolve into a furry species resembling [sea lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion "Sea lion"): though possibly still able to walk upright (it is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that they occasionally catch land animals), they have a [snout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout "Snout") with teeth adapted for catching fish, a streamlined skull and flipper-like hands with [rudimentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality "Vestigiality") fingers (described as "[nubbins](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nubbin "wiktionary:nubbin")").

The story's narrator is a spirit who has been watching over humans for the last million years. This particular ghost is the immortal spirit of Leon Trotsky Trout, son of Vonnegut's recurring character [Kilgore Trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilgore_Trout "Kilgore Trout"). Leon is a [Vietnam War veteran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_veteran "Vietnam veteran") who is affected by the massacres in Vietnam. He goes [AWOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL "AWOL") and settles in [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), where he works as a shipbuilder and dies during the construction of the ship, the *Bahía de Darwin*. This ship is used for the "Nature Cruise of the Century". Planned as a celebrity cruise, it was in limbo due to the economic downturn, and due to a chain of unconnected events the ship ended up allowing humans to reach and survive in the Galápagos. A group of girls from a [cannibal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cannibalism "Human cannibalism") tribe living in the Amazon rainforest, called the Kanka-bono girls also end up on the ship, eventually having children with sperm obtained from the ship's captain.

The deceased Kilgore Trout makes four appearances in the novel, urging his son to enter the "blue tunnel" that leads to the afterlife. When Leon refuses for the fourth time, Kilgore pledges that he, and the blue tunnel, will not return for one million years, which leaves Leon to observe the slow process of evolution that transforms the humans into aquatic mammals. The process begins when a Japanese woman on the island, the granddaughter of a [Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") survivor, gives birth to a fur-covered daughter.

Trout maintains that all the sorrows of humankind were caused by "the only true villain in my story: the oversized human brain". [Natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection") eliminates this problem, since the humans best fitted to Santa Rosalia were those who could swim best, which required a streamlined head, which in turn required a smaller brain.

## Literary techniques

The main story is told a-chronologically with a framing story told by a narrator from a point a million years in the future, interspersed with flashbacks and commentary about the outcomes of future events of the main storyline. As a gimmick, an asterisk is placed in front of a character's name if they will die before sunset.

The novel contains a large number of quotations from other authors. They are related to the story itself and are functionally inserted through Mandarax, a fictional voice translator that is also able to provide quotations from literature and history. The following authors are quoted (in order of their appearance in the book): [Anne Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank "Anne Frank"), [Alfred Tennyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson "Alfred Tennyson"), [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling "Rudyard Kipling"), [John Masefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Masefield "John Masefield"), [William Cullen Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cullen_Bryant "William Cullen Bryant"), [Ambrose Bierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose_Bierce "Ambrose Bierce"), [Lord Byron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron "Lord Byron"), Noble Claggett, [John Greenleaf Whittier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Greenleaf_Whittier "John Greenleaf Whittier"), [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin"), [John Heywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Heywood "John Heywood"), [Cesare Bonesana Beccaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Bonesana_Beccaria "Cesare Bonesana Beccaria"), [Bertolt Brecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht "Bertolt Brecht"), [Saint John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Evangelist "John the Evangelist"), [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens "Charles Dickens"), [Isaac Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Watts "Isaac Watts"), [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare"), [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), [Robert Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning "Robert Browning"), [Jean de La Fontaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_La_Fontaine "Jean de La Fontaine"), [François Rabelais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Rabelais "François Rabelais"), [Patrick R.

In 2009, [Audible.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible.com "Audible.com") produced an audio version of *Galapagos*, narrated by [Jonathan Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonathan_Davis_\(audiobook_narrator\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jonathan Davis (audiobook narrator) (page does not exist)"), as part of its *Modern Vanguard* line of audiobooks.

In 2014, artists Tucker Marder and [Christian Scheider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Scheider "Christian Scheider") adapted "Galapagos" into a live theatrical performance at the new [Parrish Art Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrish_Art_Museum "Parrish Art Museum") in Watermill, N.Y. Endorsed by the [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut "Kurt Vonnegut") Estate, the multi-media production featured 26 performers including Bob Balaban; live orchestral underscoring composed and conducted by Forrest Gray featuring Max Feldschuh on vibraphone and Ken Sacks on mbira; animal costumes by Isla Hansen; a three-story scenic design by Shelby Jackson; experimental video projections by James Bayard; and choreography by Matt Davies.

In 2019, Canadian band The PepTides released a ten-song collection titled "Galápagos Vol.1",[^1] inspired by the themes and characters in Galápagos.
