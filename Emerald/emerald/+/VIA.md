VIA is a free, open-source keyboard firmware and configuration tool that
  allows users to customize the layout, functions, and behavior of their
  mechanical keyboards. It was developed as an alternative to other
  proprietary keyboard firmware solutions, such as QMK and firmware provided
  by keyboard manufacturers.

  VIA allows users to easily customize their keyboard layout by dragging and
  dropping keys to different positions on the keyboard layout grid. It also
  supports per-key programming, allowing users to assign custom functions to
  any key on their keyboard. Additionally, VIA supports RGB lighting
  customization, allowing users to control the color and pattern of their
  keyboard's backlighting.

  VIA is compatible with a wide range of mechanical keyboards, including
  popular models from Ducky, Keychron, and Epomaker. It can be installed on
  most operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The VIA
  software can be downloaded from the official GitHub repository or from the
  VIA website.
