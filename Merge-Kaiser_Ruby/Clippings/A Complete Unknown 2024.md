***A Complete Unknown*** is a 2024 American [biographical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film "Biographical film") [musical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film "Musical film") [drama film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_\(film_and_television\) "Drama (film and television)") directed by [James Mangold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold "James Mangold"), who co-wrote the screenplay with [Jay Cocks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks "Jay Cocks"), about American [singer-songwriter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singer-songwriter "Singer-songwriter") [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan"). Based on the 2015 book *Dylan Goes Electric!* by [Elijah Wald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Wald "Elijah Wald"), the film portrays Dylan through his earliest folk music success until the momentous [controversy over his use of electric instruments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy "Electric Dylan controversy") at the [1965 Newport Folk Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival "Newport Folk Festival"). [Timothée Chalamet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth%C3%A9e_Chalamet "Timothée Chalamet") (who also produces) stars as Dylan, with [Edward Norton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton "Edward Norton"), [Elle Fanning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning "Elle Fanning"), [Monica Barbaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro "Monica Barbaro"), [Boyd Holbrook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook "Boyd Holbrook"), [Dan Fogler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler "Dan Fogler"), [Norbert Leo Butz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Leo_Butz "Norbert Leo Butz"), and [Scoot McNairy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy "Scoot McNairy") in supporting roles. The film's title is derived from the chorus of Dylan's 1965 single "[Like a Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone "Like a Rolling Stone")".

*A Complete Unknown* premiered at the [Dolby Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Theatre "Dolby Theatre") in [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") on December 10, 2024, and was released in the United States by [Searchlight Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures "Searchlight Pictures") on December 25, 2024. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. It was named one of the top ten films of 2024 by the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") and the [National Board of Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review "National Board of Review"), the latter of which also awarded Fanning [Best Supporting Actress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress "National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress").[^7] It received three nominations at the [82nd Golden Globe Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Golden_Globe_Awards "82nd Golden Globe Awards") (including [Best Motion Picture – Drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Drama "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama")), three at the [Critics Choice Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_Critics%27_Choice_Awards "30th Critics' Choice Awards") (including [Best Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics%27_Choice_Movie_Award_for_Best_Picture "Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Picture")), and four at the [31st Screen Actors Guild Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards "31st Screen Actors Guild Awards") (including [Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award_for_Outstanding_Performance_by_a_Cast_in_a_Motion_Picture "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture")).

In 1961, [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan") moves to [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), seeking to meet his recently hospitalized idol [Woody Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie "Woody Guthrie"). Dylan meets Guthrie along with his close friend [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger") in the hospital. Dylan performs [a song he wrote for Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_to_Woody "Song to Woody"), impressing the two folk musicians. Seeger invites Dylan to stay with his family, slowly ingratiating the newcomer into New York City's folk scene. Dylan meets [Sylvie Russo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo "Suze Rotolo") at a concert, charming her with his contrarian opinions and tales of working at a carnival. The two begin a relationship and move in together.

Following a performance by [Joan Baez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez "Joan Baez"), Seeger introduces Dylan at an open mic night attended by industry executives and manager [Albert Grossman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman "Albert Grossman"). Dylan flirts with Baez and impresses the crowd, prompting Grossman to take him on as a client on the spot. Dylan begins work on [an album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_\(album\) "Bob Dylan (album)") but is forced by [his label](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia Records") to record mostly covers. The record's sales are poor, frustrating Dylan.

Before leaving on a lengthy school trip to Europe, Russo has an argument with Dylan. She is upset by his aloof nature and deliberate attempt to conceal his past from her. Despite this, she encourages him to push for recording his original music. While she is away, Dylan capitalizes on political and social unrest to build a following for his socially conscious songwriting. This draws Baez's attention, and the two begin an affair and artistic collaboration. Russo becomes suspicious in seeing Dylan's professional closeness with Baez and by 1965, Dylan and Russo have separated.

Having achieved stardom but not artistic freedom, Dylan laments that he is beholden to the expectations of the industry and the folk music community. A long-awaited tour with Baez ends in disaster; an argument over Dylan's ego, along with Baez's demands that they play his popular songs instead of new material, leads to Dylan walking off-stage mid-performance.

Dylan's desire to break free of expectations drives him to experiment with electric guitar and rock instruments, [a controversial direction within the folk scene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy "Electric Dylan controversy"), who overwhelmingly prefer simple acoustic arrangements. Dylan pieces together his band and begins recording *[Highway 61 Revisited](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited "Highway 61 Revisited").* Dylan's new direction is especially worrisome for the [Newport Folk Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival "Newport Folk Festival") planning committee, who have hired Dylan to headline the 1965 event but fear he may debut his divisive new sound.

Dylan invites Russo along to the festival, hoping to rekindle his relationship with her in the process. She accepts, but upon watching a duet ("[It Ain't Me Babe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Ain%27t_Me_Babe "It Ain't Me Babe")") between him and Baez, realizes she will never be comfortable in their relationship, becomes upset, and leaves. The committee attempts to influence Dylan to not go electric, eventually resorting to an impassioned plea from Seeger, who reminds Dylan that his own life's work is on the line. An intoxicated [Johnny Cash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash "Johnny Cash") encourages Dylan to play the electric show, and Dylan goes through with his plan. The crowd's reaction is vitriolic, throwing both invective and physical objects at the band. The committee, including Seeger, attempts to cut the sound but is thwarted by Grossman and Seeger's wife [Toshi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshi_Seeger "Toshi Seeger"). Dylan initially refuses a request from Seeger and the festival organizers to perform a folk song as an encore, but relents when Cash offers him his acoustic guitar.

The next morning, on his way out from Newport, Baez catches Dylan and remarks that he "won", that he finally got the freedom from everyone else that he wanted. Dylan visits Guthrie one last time before leaving town on his motorcycle.

It went on to debut to a total of $23.2 million over the five days (including $11.7 million in its three-day opening weekend), beating projections and finishing in sixth.[^opening-4] In its second weekend, the film made $8.2 million, bringing its box office total to $41.8 million to surpass *[The Menu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_\(2022_film\) "The Menu (2022 film)")* as the highest-grossing Searchlight title after [Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_acquisition_of_21st_Century_Fox "Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox") in 2019.[^55][^56]

On the [review aggregator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), 79% of 259 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Charged up by Timothée Chalamet's electric performance, this ballad of Bob Dylan might not get under the enigmatic artist's skin but will make you feel like you've spent time in his company."[^rotten_tomatoes-57] [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), which uses a [weighted average](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean "Weighted arithmetic mean"), assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[^metacritic-58] Audiences polled by [CinemaScore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScore "CinemaScore") gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by [PostTrak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostTrak "PostTrak") gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 76% saying they would "definitely recommend" it.[^opening-4]

In a review for *[RogerEbert.com](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RogerEbert.com "RogerEbert.com")*, Brian Tallerico awarded the film 3-1/2 out of 4 stars.[^59] He praised the "solid performances, unshowy direction, and organic editing". [Peter Bradshaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bradshaw "Peter Bradshaw") of *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* similarly praised the performances and gave the film 5 out of 5 stars, calling Chalamet "hypnotic" as Dylan.[^60] Writing for *[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")*, [Kyle Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Smith_\(critic\) "Kyle Smith (critic)") also applauded Chalamet's ability to capture different facets of Dylan's personality, including the songwriter's "supercilious air" and his creative genius. Smith especially liked the duet of the song "[It Ain't Me Babe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Ain%27t_Me_Babe "It Ain't Me Babe")" between [Monica Barbaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro "Monica Barbaro") (as [Joan Baez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez "Joan Baez")) and Chalamet, describing it "as spectacular".[^61] Filmmakers [Oliver Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone "Oliver Stone"), [William Goldenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Goldenberg "William Goldenberg") and [Paul Schrader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader "Paul Schrader") also praised the film.[^62][^63][^64]

In a mixed review, John Nugent of *[Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(magazine\) "Empire (magazine)")* gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. While he praised the performances, Nugent disliked that the movie "plays it safe" and "struggles to find something fresh to say".[^65] A negative review from [Richard Brody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brody "Richard Brody") of *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* viewed the movie as a hollow representation of Dylan's career, writing: "The movie offers answers that range from empty to artificial, leaving out the practicalities and manipulating dates and names in order to center the drama on a small number of personalities".[^66] In another negative review for *[The Forward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forward "The Forward")*, Seth Rogovoy expresses dislike for the film as a "conventional Hollywood biopic", criticizing the direction as a "mainstream route", "offering a superficial, simplified gloss on this remarkable story", as well as criticizing the historical inaccuracy and contrasting the film's approach with documentary films such as *[Dont Look Back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont_Look_Back "Dont Look Back")* in capturing Dylan's persona.[^67]
