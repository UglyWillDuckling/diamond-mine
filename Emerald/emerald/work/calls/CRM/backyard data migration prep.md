## Notes ðŸ—’
- allot of the data will probably be reused from the existing DB
- new entities should go to the project database('s)
- some of the things are still unclear and we will need to decide if we are going to build something new or not
	- $ we could also combine the existing data and make changes to the DB structure
	- additionally, we could also move some of the data to the projects DB
