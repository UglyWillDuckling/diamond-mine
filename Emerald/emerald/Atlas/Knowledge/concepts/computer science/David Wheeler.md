[David Wheeler (computer scientist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist))


Wheeler's contributions to the field included work on the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) in the 1950s[21] and the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (published 1994). Along with Maurice Wilkes and Stanley Gill, he is credited with the invention around 1951 of the subroutine (which they referred to as the closed subroutine), and gave the first explanation of how to design software libraries;[8] as a result, the jump to subroutine instruction was often called a Wheeler Jump. 
Wilkes published a paper in 1953 discussing [[relative addressing]] to facilitate the use of subroutines.[22] (However, Turing had discussed subroutines in a paper of 1945 on design proposals for the NPL ACE, going so far as to invent the concept of a [[return address stack]].

He was responsible for the implementation of the CAP computer, the first to be based on security capabilities. In cryptography, he was the designer of WAKE and the co-designer of the TEA and XTEA encryption algorithms together with Roger Needham. In 1950, with Maurice Wilkes, he used EDSAC to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies in a paper by Ronald Fisher.[24] This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology.

He became a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge in 1964 and formally retired in 1994, although he continued to be an active member of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory until his death.
