Impedance (usually denoted as Z) is a concept from electrical engineering that describes how much a circuit resists the flow of alternating current (AC). It’s like resistance, but for AC rather than direct current (DC), and it includes both [[resistance]] and [[reactance]].

Here’s a quick breakdown:

[[Resistance]] (R): Opposition to current in DC or AC, measured in ohms (Ω).
[[Reactance]] (X): Opposition due to **capacitors** and **inductors** in an AC circuit.

Impedance (Z): The combination of resistance and reactance:
`Z = R + jX`
*where j is the imaginary unit*.

Impedance is also measured in [[ohms]] (Ω), but because it includes **imaginary** parts, it’s often written in complex form like 30 + j20 Ω.
