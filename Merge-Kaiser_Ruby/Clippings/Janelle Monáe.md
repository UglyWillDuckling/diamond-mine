Monáe began her musical career in 2003 with the release of her [demo album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_album "Demo album"), *[The Audition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audition_\(album\) "The Audition (album)")*.

She has since starred in the films *[Harriet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_\(film\) "Harriet (film)")* (2019) and *[Glass Onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Onion_\(film\) "Glass Onion (film)")* (2022), and the television series *[Homecoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_\(TV_series\) "Homecoming (TV series)")* (2020). In 2022, she won a [Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_and_Family_Emmy_Awards "Children's and Family Emmy Awards") for her role in the TV series [*We the People*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_\(2021_TV_series\) "We the People (2021 TV series)"). She launched her record label, Wondaland Arts Society in a joint venture with [Epic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records "Epic Records") in 2015, and has signed artists including [Jidenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jidenna "Jidenna"), [Roman GianArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_GianArthur "Roman GianArthur") and [St. Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Beauty "St. Beauty").[^22]

> There was a lot of confusion and nonsense where I grew up, so I reacted by creating my own little world. \[...\] I began to see how music could change lives, and I began to dream about a world where every day was like anime and Broadway, where music fell from the sky and anything could happen.

—Monáe, on her childhood musical inspiration[^randb.about.com-23]

Janelle Monáe Robinson was born on December 1, 1985, in [Kansas City, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Kansas "Kansas City, Kansas"), and was raised in [Quindaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quindaro "Quindaro"), a working-class community of Kansas City.[^frees-24] Her mother, Janet, worked as a janitor and a hotel maid.[^frees-24][^25] Her father, Michael Robinson Summers, was a truck driver.[^pitch-26] Monáe's parents separated when Monáe was a toddler and her mother later married a postal worker. Monáe has a younger sister, Kimmy, from her mother's remarriage.[^frees-24]

Monáe was raised [Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist "Baptist") and learned to sing at a local church. Her family members were musicians and performers at the local [African Methodist Episcopal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Methodist_Episcopal "African Methodist Episcopal") church, the [Baptist church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist_church "Baptist church"), and the [Church of God in Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_God_in_Christ "Church of God in Christ").[^frees-24][^pitch-26] Monáe dreamed of being a singer and a performer from a very young age,[^randb.about.com-23] and has cited the fictional character of [Dorothy Gale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale "Dorothy Gale") from *[The Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz "The Wizard of Oz")* as a musical influence.[^27] *[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miseducation_of_Lauryn_Hill "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill")*, which Monáe bought two copies of with her first check, was another source of inspiration.[^28] She performed songs from the album on [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth "Juneteenth") talent shows, winning three years in a row.[^frees-24]

As a teenager, Monáe was enrolled in the Coterie Theater's Young Playwrights' Round Table,[^nyt2018wortham-29][^guardian2010lynskey-30] which began writing musicals. One musical, completed when she was around the age of 12, was inspired by the 1979 [Stevie Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder "Stevie Wonder") album *[Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder%27s_Journey_Through_%22The_Secret_Life_of_Plants%22 "Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \"The Secret Life of Plants\"")*.[^guardian2010lynskey-30]

Monáe attended [F. L. Schlagle High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._L._Schlagle_High_School "F. L. Schlagle High School"),[^pitch-26] and after high school, moved to [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") to study musical theater at the [American Musical and Dramatic Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Musical_and_Dramatic_Academy "American Musical and Dramatic Academy"), where she was the only black woman in her class.[^nyt2018wortham-29][^guardian2010lynskey-30] Monáe enjoyed the experience, but feared that she might lose her edge and "sound, or look or feel like anybody else".[^nyt2018wortham-29] In a 2010 interview Monáe explained, "I felt like that was a home but I wanted to write my own musicals. I didn't want to have to live vicariously through a character that had been played thousands of times – in a line with everybody wanting to play the same person."[^guardian2010lynskey-30]

After a year and a half, Monáe dropped out of the academy and relocated to [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"), enrolling at [Georgia Perimeter College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Perimeter_College "Georgia Perimeter College"). She began writing her own music and performing around the campus.[^nyt2018wortham-29] In 2003, Monáe self-released a [demo album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_album "Demo album") titled *[The Audition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audition_\(album\) "The Audition (album)")*,[^newyorker2018stfelix-31] which she sold out of the trunk of a [Mitsubishi Galant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Galant "Mitsubishi Galant").[^nyt2018wortham-29] During this period she worked at an [Office Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Depot "Office Depot") but was fired for answering a fan's e-mail using a company computer, an incident that inspired the song "Lettin' Go", which in turn attracted the attention of [Big Boi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Boi "Big Boi").[^guardian2010lynskey-30]

### Career beginnings (2005)

Monáe appeared on the [Purple Ribbon All-Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Ribbon_All-Stars "Purple Ribbon All-Stars") album *[Got Purp? Vol. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_Purp%3F_Vol._2 "Got Purp? Vol. 2")* as well as on OutKast's 2006 album *[Idlewild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlewild_\(OutKast_album\) "Idlewild (OutKast album)")*, where she was featured on the songs "Call the Law" and "In Your Dreams".[^32] Big Boi told his friend [Sean Combs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs "Sean Combs") about Monáe, of whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe's [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace "MySpace") page and according to a [HitQuarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitQuarters "HitQuarters") interview with [Bad Boy Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records "Bad Boy Records") A&R person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it right away: "\[He\] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved the way she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[^hitquarters.com-33]

Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than develop the artist and her music, as Mitchell noted: "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."[^hitquarters.com-33]

### *Metropolis* and *The ArchAndroid* (2007–2011)

In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work, *Metropolis.* It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, *[Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis:_Suite_I_\(The_Chase\) "Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)")* in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with Sean Combs's label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled *Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)* and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy Awards [Grammy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy "Grammy") nomination for [Best Urban/Alternative Performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Urban/Alternative_Performance "Best Urban/Alternative Performance") for the single "[Many Moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_Moons_\(song\) "Many Moons (song)")",[^grammy-34] festival appearances and opening slots for [indie pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop "Indie pop") band [of Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Montreal "Of Montreal"). Monáe also toured as the opening act for band [No Doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Doubt "No Doubt") on their summer 2009 tour.[^35] Her single "Open Happiness" was featured in the 2009 season finale of *[American Idol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol "American Idol")*.[^36] Monáe told MTV about the concept for her new album and also discussed an [alter ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego "Alter ego") named Cindi Mayweather. She said:

> Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances. The first album she was running because she had fallen in love with a human and she was being disassembled for that.[^37]

In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album, *[The ArchAndroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ArchAndroid "The ArchAndroid")*. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites of *Metropolis* are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist of *Metropolis: The Chase Suite* – becomes a [messianic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic "Messianic") figure to the [android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_\(robot\) "Android (robot)") community of Metropolis.[^38] Monáe announced plans to shoot a video for each song on *The ArchAndroid* and create a film, [graphic novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel "Graphic novel") and a touring Broadway musical based on the album.[^39] The *Metropolis* concept series draws inspiration from a wide range of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging from [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock "Alfred Hitchcock") to [Debussy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debussy "Debussy") to [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick "Philip K. Dick"). The series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent film *[Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_\(1927_film\) "Metropolis (1927 film)")*, which Monáe referred to as "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard.[^philly.com-40][^41] Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover for *The ArchAndroid* is inspired by the iconic poster for *Metropolis*), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. Where *Metropolis* android Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as "... the [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_\(philosophy\) "Other (philosophy)"). And I feel like all of us, whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point."[^philly.com-40][^42]

Monáe received the Vanguard Award from the [American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Composers,_Authors_and_Publishers "American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers") at the Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2010.[^43] Monáe covered [Charlie Chaplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin "Charlie Chaplin")'s *[Smile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_\(Charlie_Chaplin_song\) "Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)")* on Billboard.com in June 2010. In an NPR interview in September 2010, Monáe said she is a believer in, and a proponent of, time travel.[^44] Monáe performed "[Tightrope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tightrope_\(Janelle_Mon%C3%A1e_song\) "Tightrope (Janelle Monáe song)")" during the second elimination episode of the 11th Season of *[Dancing with the Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_with_the_Stars_\(U.S._TV_series\) "Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)")* on September 28, 2010.[^45] Monáe performed at the [53rd Annual Grammy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53rd_Annual_Grammy_Awards "53rd Annual Grammy Awards") in 2011 alongside artists [Bruno Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Mars "Bruno Mars") and [B.o.B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.o.B "B.o.B"); they performed the synth section of B.o.B's song "Nothin' on You" and she then performed the track "Cold War" with B.o.B on the guitar and Mars on the drums. The performance received a standing ovation.[^46] Monáe's single "Tightrope" was also featured on the [American Idols LIVE! Tour 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idols_LIVE!_Tour_2011 "American Idols LIVE! Tour 2011"), performed by [Pia Toscano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_Toscano "Pia Toscano"), [Haley Reinhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haley_Reinhart "Haley Reinhart"), [Naima Adedapo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naima_Adedapo "Naima Adedapo"), and [Thia Megia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thia_Megia "Thia Megia").

In September 2011, Monáe was featured as a guest vocalist on [fun.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun. "Fun.")'s single, "[We Are Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Young "We Are Young")", which achieved major commercial success, topping the charts of more than ten countries and selling over ten million units worldwide. The song garnered Monáe three Grammy nominations at the [55th Annual Grammy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55th_Annual_Grammy_Awards "55th Annual Grammy Awards"), including [Record of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_the_Year "Record of the Year").[^47] [Nate Ruess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Ruess "Nate Ruess"), the lead singer of fun., performed an acoustic version of "We Are Young" with Monáe.[^48] On December 11, 2011, Monáe performed at the Nobel Peace Prize concert in Oslo, Norway, including her songs 'Cold War', 'Tightrope', and a cover of the Jackson 5's 'I Want You Back'.[^49]

### *The Electric Lady* and other projects (2012–2014)

Monáe was also featured on "Do My Thing" for [Estelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelle_\(musician\) "Estelle (musician)")'s studio album, *[All of Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_of_Me_\(Estelle_album\) "All of Me (Estelle album)")*. In June 2012, Monáe performed two new songs, "Electric Lady" and "Dorothy Dandridge Eyes" – from her then-upcoming sophomore studio album, *[The Electric Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Lady "The Electric Lady")* – at the Toronto Jazz Festival.[^50] In July 2012, for the second year in a row, Monáe appeared at the [North Sea Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_Jazz "North Sea Jazz") Festival in Europe as well as in the 46th edition of the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland on the 14th.

### Musical styles and influences

Monáe has a [mezzo-soprano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzo-soprano "Mezzo-soprano") voice.[^132] *[The Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")* published an interview with Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, "I begin to worry for a moment that Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd "Nerd"), but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between [James Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown "James Brown"), [Judy Garland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland "Judy Garland"), [André 3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_3000 "André 3000") and [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs"), invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." She also compared Monáe to artists such as [Annie Lennox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Lennox "Annie Lennox"), [Lauryn Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauryn_Hill "Lauryn Hill"), and [Corinne Bailey Rae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinne_Bailey_Rae "Corinne Bailey Rae").[^telegraph.co.uk-133] Monáe's musical styles have been described as "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz".[^134] *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* has noted some of Monáe's influences as [Michael Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson "Michael Jackson"), [Janet Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson "Janet Jackson"), [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_\(musician\) "Prince (musician)"), [Outkast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outkast "Outkast"), [Erykah Badu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erykah_Badu "Erykah Badu"), [James Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown "James Brown"), [Grace Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Jones "Grace Jones"), [Stevie Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder "Stevie Wonder"), [David Bowie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie"), [Jimi Hendrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix "Jimi Hendrix"), [Bernard Herrmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann "Bernard Herrmann"), [Funkadelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funkadelic "Funkadelic") and the [Incredible String Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredible_String_Band "Incredible String Band").[^guardian2010lynskey-30] Matthew Valnes likens Monáe's dancing style in the music video for "Tightrope" to that of James Brown.[^valnes2017-135] In an opinion piece for *[The Quietus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quietus "The Quietus")*,[^136] John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the [Afrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism "Afrofuturism") movement, pointing out her similarities to [Sun Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra "Sun Ra") and [George Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_\(funk_musician\) "George Clinton (funk musician)"). He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has said she has an alter ego from the year 2719, named Cindi Mayweather.[^137]

In [her first EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis:_Suite_I_\(The_Chase\) "Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)"), Monáe gave this alter ego a back story: she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human, Anthony Greendown. Monáe has expanded on Cindi's mythos, saying, "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the haves and the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the [Archangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel "Archangel") in the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible"), and what [Neo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_\(The_Matrix\) "Neo (The Matrix)") represents to *[The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix "The Matrix")*."[^io9.com-138] In her [second album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ArchAndroid "The ArchAndroid"), Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to "suppress freedom and love".[^139] Chris Champion of *[The Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer "The Observer")* described *Metropolis* and *The ArchAndroid* as "[psychedelic soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_soul "Psychedelic soul") with a sci-fi twist".[^140] Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where the android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of 1960s through 1980s is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts, "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."[^valnes2017-135] Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".[^141]

Monáe's roots in Kansas City, Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan's [Pitchfork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Media "Pitchfork Media") feature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."[^pitchfork_cover_story-1] Monáe also told the *[London Evening Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Evening_Standard "London Evening Standard")* she has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".[^evening_standard-142] On the album *The ArchAndroid*, especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".[^143] Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.

> I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman. I don't believe in men's wear or women's wear, I just like what I like. And I think we should just be respected for being an individual ... I've been in *Vogue*, now, and different publications, which is cool, because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress.

—Monáe, on her image and artistic freedom[^io9.com-138]

Janelle Monáe is known for her eccentric style

Monáe's signature style is her [tuxedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuxedo "Tuxedo") wardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records."[^144] Monáe's signature look harkens back to [dandyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandyism "Dandyism").[^145] Citing [Grace Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Jones "Grace Jones") and [Josephine Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Baker "Josephine Baker") as role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th-century look in the classical white and black pattern.[^146] Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career, when she was employed as a maid. She mentioned this in her acceptance speech for the "Young, Gifted, and Black" award at the 2012 [Black Girls Rock!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Girls_Rock! "Black Girls Rock!") ceremony.[^147] Monáe has been known to distribute the *Ten Droid Commandments*, which encourages her fans to be individuals.[^io9.com-138] *The Telegraph* also commented on her image as an artist, saying, "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes."[^telegraph.co.uk-133] Monáe describes tuxedos as a uniform for her career, speaks of wanting to redefine how women dress,[^io9.com-138] and has been featured in the "Style 100" of *[InStyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InStyle "InStyle")* magazine.[^148] The [Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Fashion_Designers_of_America_Awards "Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards") honored Monáe with the Board of Directors' Tribute and the American Ingenuity Award for her "straoridanra ability to experiment in fashion".[^149][^150]

When it comes to her acting career, Monáe expressed desire to shape it around that of [Johnny Depp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp "Johnny Depp"), stating that he has a very vast career: "The amount of roles: [Willy Wonka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka "Willy Wonka") to [Sweeney Todd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeney_Todd "Sweeney Todd") to all of the dramatic roles. Whatever the Janelle Monáe version of that is. Maybe something even better..."[^151]

During a 2011 interview with *[London Evening Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Evening_Standard "London Evening Standard")*, Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a Black woman ... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[^evening_standard-142] In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to \[her\]" and expressed support for the [LGBTQ community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_community "LGBTQ community").[^okayplayer-152]

Monáe has said she identifies with both [bisexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality "Bisexuality") and [pansexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexuality "Pansexuality").[^frees-24] On January 10, 2020, she [tweeted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweeted "Tweeted") the [hashtag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag") #IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.[^153][^154] Monáe said in an interview with *[The Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cut_\(website\) "The Cut (website)")* a month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community. I retweeted the *[Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe")* meme 'Are you a boy or a girl? I'm an experience' because it resonated with me, especially as someone who has pushed boundaries of gender since the beginning of my career. I feel my feminine energy, my masculine energy, and energy I can't even explain."[^155]

In April 2022, she [came out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Came_out "Came out") publicly as [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary "Non-binary") on the *[Red Table Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Table_Talk "Red Table Talk")* saying, "I'm nonbinary, so I just don't see myself as a woman, solely ... I feel like god is so much bigger than the 'he' or the 'she.' And if I am from God, I am everything."[^:0-156] In the interview, she also acknowledged having been in both [monogamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamous "Monogamous") and [polyamorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamorous "Polyamorous") relationships.[^:0-156] Following the interview, a representative of Monáe said that she "continues to use she/her pronouns."[^157] In an interview with the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")*, however, Monáe identified herself as non-binary and added that her "pronouns are free-ass motherfucker—and they/them, her/she."[^158][^159]
