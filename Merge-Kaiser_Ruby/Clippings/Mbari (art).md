**Mbari** is a visual art form practiced by the [Igbo people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people "Igbo people") in southeast [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria") consisting of a sacred two- story house constructed as a [propitiatory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_seat "Mercy seat") rite.[^cole-1] Mbari houses of the [Owerri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owerri "Owerri")\-Igbo, which are large opened-sided square planned shelters contain many life-sized, painted figures (sculpted in mud to appease the [Alusi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alusi "Alusi") (deity) and [Ala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_\(mythology\) "Ala (mythology)"), the [earth goddess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_goddess "Earth goddess"), with other deities of thunder and water).[^architecture-2] Mbari houses are made as a gift to [Ala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_\(odinani\) "Ala (odinani)"), as a way to acknowledge [Ala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_\(odinani\) "Ala (odinani)")'s charitable and overarching presence. Some Mbari houses are dedicated strictly and solely to [Ala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_\(odinani\) "Ala (odinani)"). Sometimes, however, other gods are represented along with [Ala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_\(odinani\) "Ala (odinani)") in the structure. [^3] Other sculptures which could be included are of officials, craftsmen, foreigners (mainly Europeans), [animals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal"), [legendary creatures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_creature "Legendary creature") and ancestors.[^architecture-2] Mbari houses take years to build and building them is regarded as sacred. Along with being representations of abundances and harmony, they are most usually created during times of peace and stability.[^4] A ceremony is performed within the structure for a gathering of town leaders. After the ritual is complete, going in or even looking at the Mbari house is considered taboo. Mbari are public shrine galleries where complex characters of Igbo mythology, folklore, and society are fleshed out in termite earth.

[[Chinua Achebe]]
[Chinua Achebe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe "Chinua Achebe"), renowned Nigerian novelist and literary theorist said, in his essay on Mbari, "Mbari was a celebration through art of the world and of life lived in it. It was performed by the community on command by its presiding deity, usually the Earth goddess, [Ala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ala_\(goddess\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ala (goddess) (page does not exist)"), who combined two formidable roles in the Igbo pantheon as fountain of creativity in the world and custodian of the moral order in human society."[^cole-1] The [Mbari Club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbari_Club "Mbari Club") — a cultural centre for writers and artists co-founded in 1961 by [Ulli Beier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulli_Beier "Ulli Beier") and others in Ibadan — was so named at Achebe's suggestion.[^5]
