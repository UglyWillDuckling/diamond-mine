**Abuja** ()[^:4-4] is the capital city of the [Federal Republic of Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Republic_of_Nigeria "Federal Republic of Nigeria"),[^5] strategically situated at the geographic midpoint of the country within the [Federal Capital Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory_\(Nigeria\) "Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)") (FCT). As the seat of the [Federal Government of Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Government_of_Nigeria "Federal Government of Nigeria"), it hosts key national institutions, landmarks, and buildings spread across its over 50 districts. It replaced [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos"), (most populous city in Nigeria) as the capital on 12 December 1991.[^6][^:2-7]

Abuja's [geography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography") is defined by [Aso Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aso_Rock "Aso Rock"), a 400-metre (1,300 ft) [monolith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith "Monolith") left by [water erosion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_erosion "Water erosion"). The [Presidential Complex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Presidential_Complex "Nigerian Presidential Complex"), [National Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_National_Assembly "Nigerian National Assembly"),[^8] [Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Supreme_Court "Nigerian Supreme Court") and much of the city extends to the south of the rock. [Zuma Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuma_Rock "Zuma Rock"), a 792-metre (2,598 ft) [monolith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith "Monolith"), lies just [north](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North "North") of the [city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City "City") on the [expressway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway "Controlled-access highway") to [Kaduna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna "Kaduna").[^9]

At the 2006 [census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census "Census"), the city of Abuja had a [population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population "Population") of 776,298[^plac-10] and 179,674 households[^11] making it one of the [ten most populous cities in Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nigerian_cities_by_population "List of Nigerian cities by population") (placing eighth as of 2006). According to the United Nations, Abuja grew by 139.7% between 2000 and 2010, making it the fastest-growing city in the world.[^euromonitor2010-12] As of 2015<sup class="plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update"><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abuja&amp;action=edit">[update]</a></sup>, the city is experiencing an annual growth of at least 35%, retaining its position as the fastest-growing city on the African continent and one of the fastest-growing in the world.[^abujafacts5-13][^14] As of 2016, the [metropolitan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area "Metropolitan area") area of Abuja is estimated at six million people, placing it behind only [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos") as the most populous metro area in Nigeria.[^jaiyeola-15][^16][^17]

Major religious sites include the [Nigerian National Mosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_National_Mosque "Nigerian National Mosque") and the [Nigerian National Christian Centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_National_Christian_Centre "Nigerian National Christian Centre"). The city is served by the [Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnamdi_Azikiwe_International_Airport "Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport").[^18][^19][^20] Abuja is known for being one of the few purpose-built capital cities in Africa, as well as being one of the wealthiest.[^bbc-21]

Abuja is Nigeria's [administrative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_\(government\) "Administration (government)") and political capital. It is also a key capital on the African continent due to Nigeria's [geo-political](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-political "Geo-political") influence in regional affairs.[^amlsnconference-22] Abuja is also a conference centre and hosts various meetings annually, such as the 2003 [Commonwealth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") Heads of Government meeting and the 2014 World Economic Forum (Africa) meetings.[^amlsnconference-22][^23] Abuja joined the [UNESCO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

Millenium Park

"Abuja" was in the earlier 20th century the name of the nearby town now called [Suleja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleja "Suleja").[^fcda-about-24]

The indigenous inhabitants of Abuja are the Abawa, [Basa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basa_languages "Basa languages"), [Gwandara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwandara "Gwandara"), [Gbagyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gbagyi "Gbagyi") (Gwari) having the majority population in the region. Other groups in the area include the [Gade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gade_\(language\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gade (language) (page does not exist)"), [Dibo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibo_language "Dibo language"), Egburra, Nupe and [Koro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nkoroo_language "Nkoroo language").[^25]

The [Gwandara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwandara "Gwandara") speaking people in Abuja are mostly found in AMAC and Bwari Area Council. Some of their villages/settlements are Wuse, Asokoro now relocated to Sabon Wuse, Aso in Niger and other neighbouring states. Others are Karshi, Kurudu, [Nyanya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyanya_\(Abuja\) "Nyanya (Abuja)"), Idu, Gwagwa, Jiwa, Sheretti, Karmo, Takunshara, Burum, Dutse Alhaji, Zuba, Kuje, Kwoi, Karon-Magaji, Ija, Kanwu, Sherre. [^26] In light of the ethnic and religious [divisions of Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nigeria "Demographics of Nigeria"), plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties, and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity.[^27]

Another impetus for Abuja came because of [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos")' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid.[^28] As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development, the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country, and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja.[^29] The logic used was similar to the way Brazil planned its capital, [Brasília](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia "Brasília").

The Federal Military Government of Nigeria promulgated decree No. 6 on 4 February 1976, which initiated the removal of the Federal Capital from Lagos to Abuja.[^the_political_history_of_nigeria's-30][^naij-why-31] The initial work for Abuja's planning and implementation was carried out by the Military Government of General's [Murtala Mohammed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtala_Mohammed "Murtala Mohammed") and [Olusegun Obasanjo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun_Obasanjo "Olusegun Obasanjo"). However, the foundation of Abuja was under the Administration of Shehu Shagari in 1979.[^the_political_history_of_nigeria's-30] Construction started in 1979 but, due to economic and political instability, the initial stages of the city were not complete until the late 1980s.[^32]

The move of Nigeria's Capital to Abuja was controversial, and the biggest opposition to it was led by [Obafemi Awolowo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obafemi_Awolowo "Obafemi Awolowo").[^jstor.org-33] Awolowo, as a politician and a representative of the Yoruba people, defended their claims against the move of the Capital from Lagos. During the hotly-contested campaign for the presidency, he vowed to hire the American [Walt Disney Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Company "Walt Disney Company") to convert the new site (Abuja) into an amusement park if he was elected.[^jstor.org-33] However, after his election as president, Alhaji [Shehu Shagari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehu_Shagari "Shehu Shagari") laid the first foundation for Abuja's infrastructure and pushed for its early completion. His first journey outside of Lagos after his election was to Abuja, where he visited contractors and workers on site to urge a speedy completion of the project. On his return, he confided in Alhaji [Abubakar Koko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Koko "Abubakar Koko") his disappointment with the slow progress of work.[^jstor.org-33] Shehu Shagari rescheduled the planned relocation to Abuja from 1986 to 1982 which later proved difficult.[^34]

The International Planning Associates (IPA) was commissioned in June 1977, by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA)[^35] to produce the Abuja Master Plan and its regional grid.[^36] According to the terms of reference, the master planning process was to include a review of relevant data, selection of a capital city site, preparation of regional and city plans and the accompanying design and development standards manual.[^37]

IPA did not exist prior to the Nigerian Government's engagement with an internationally reputable firm to design the master plan. IPA was formed by a consortium of three American firms which won the worldwide competitive bidding. The firms were Planning Research Corporation (PRC), Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd, and Archisystems (a division of the Hughes Organisation). After winning the bid, and completing the project, the firms were disbanded.

The final report was submitted to the pioneer Executive Secretary of FCDA, Alhaji [Abubakar Koko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Koko "Abubakar Koko"), on 15 February 1979. In the preface to the master plan, the following declaration was made by IPA:

> "The master plan for Abuja the new Capital City of Nigeria represents the culmination of 18 months' work by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) board, and several advisory panel consultants. Without the unstinting efforts of these experts, the momentum now exhibited at the beginning of the actual implementation of the new capital could not have been achieved. The plan itself represents a milestone in the process of building the new capital city. It is a necessary element in the monumental effort about to be undertaken by the Nigerian people."

The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are now visible. More detailed design of the central areas of the capital, particularly its monumental core, was accomplished by Japanese architect [Kenzo Tange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenzo_Tange "Kenzo Tange"), with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company.[^38] Most countries relocated their [embassies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy "Embassy") to Abuja, and many maintain their former embassies as [consulates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_\(representative\) "Consul (representative)") in [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos"), the commercial capital of Nigeria.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Abuja, Nigeria

Abuja under [Köppen climate classification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") features a [tropical wet and dry climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_wet_and_dry_climate "Tropical wet and dry climate") ([Köppen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"): *Aw*). The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid [rainy season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_season "Rainy season") and a blistering [dry season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season "Dry season").[^74] In between the two, there is a brief interlude of [harmattan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmattan "Harmattan") occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of [dust haze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze "Haze") and cloudless skies.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>[^75]

The [rainy season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season "Wet season") begins from April and ends in October,[^76] when daytime temperatures reach 28 °C (82.4 °F) to 30 °C (86.0 °F) and nighttime lows hover around 22 °C (71.6 °F) to 23 °C (73.4 °F).[^:0-77] In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as 40 °C (104.0 °F) and overnight temperatures can dip to 20 °C (68.0 °F). Even the coolest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above 30 °C (86.0 °F).[^:0-77] The medium altitude and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory. The city's inland location causes the [diurnal temperature variation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation "Diurnal temperature variation") to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos").<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Rainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the [Jos Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Plateau "Jos Plateau") and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from April to October every year.[^78]

The effects of [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") have been observed in Abuja, according to a study conducted by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Atmospheric Science Group of [Imo State University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State_University "Imo State University").[^:3-79] Between 1993 and 2013, the average maximum temperature trended downward, but the average minimum and mean temperatures trended upwards.[^:3-79] There was a downward trend for rainfall in Abuja, based on data collected between 1986 and 2016.[^80][^81] The drought occurrence probability for Abuja increased by 15.4% between 1975 and 2014.[^82]

### Environmental impact reduction

The FCT falls within the [Guinean forest-savanna mosaic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinean_forest-savanna_mosaic "Guinean forest-savanna mosaic") zone of the West African sub-region.[^84] Patches of [rain forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_forest "Rain forest"), however, occur in the Gwagwa plains, especially in the rugged terrain to the southeastern parts of the territory, where a landscape of gullies and rough terrain is found. These areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) form one of the few surviving occurrences of the mature forest vegetation in [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria").
