Hello everyone! I'm here to share another `docker-compose` script I put together to save some files at home,  
using an old PC I had lying around.  
  
So, if you've got a little unused PC and want to use it for backups or to store files —  
without filling up the disk on your main computer or relying on the internet — I think this could be a great option!

I used **ProFTPD**, which was the easiest and simplest FTP service I found.  [^1]
  
I also tested **vsftpd**, but I found it a bit more complex to set up.  

```yml
services:
  ftp-container:
    image: kibatic/proftpd
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
    environment:
      FTP_LIST: "username:password"
      USERADD_OPTIONS: "-o --gid 33 --uid 33"
    volumes:
      - "./files:/home/data"
```

Now I'll explain some of the configurations you might want to tweak for your own setup:

- **network\_mode —** This option makes the container use the same network as the host machine  
	(the PC running the FTP server).  
	That way, the service becomes visible on your local network — so you can access it from your phone or any other device connected to the same network.
- **FTP\_LIST —** Here you set the username and password in the format username:password.  
	You can add more users by separating them with;.
	```
	Note: The password cannot contain special characters.
	```
- **USERADD\_OPTIONS —** Sets the group and default user inside the container.  
	With this setup, it can create and read files normally.
- **volumes —** The first path (./files) is the folder on your computer that will be shared with the FTP.  
	That’s where your files will be saved. I recommend creating an empty folder named files in the same directory as the script.  
	The second path (/home/data) is the directory inside the container — this name can be anything you like.  
	The important part is making sure the first path is correct.
