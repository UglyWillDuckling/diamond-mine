## Obsidian Sets

This plugins is inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [AnyType](https://anytype.io/) and implements a way to strucure data using obsidian notes, specifically the recently released properies.

[![Alt text](https://github.com/Canna71/obsidian-sets/raw/main/image.png)](https://github.com/Canna71/obsidian-sets/blob/main/image.png)

It provides the following features:

- usage of Obsidian properties to edit data
- a query engine that allows to select items based on their properties
- Types and Collections
- visualizations of items using different layouts (Grid, Board, Gallery, List)
- easy creation of new items from the GUI

Please see full documentation [here](https://github.com/Canna71/obsidian-sets/blob/main/docs/doc.md)

## Roadmap

- Aggregations
- Other Layouts
- Search for text in items
- Integration with other plugins (Templater, etc)
- More properties types (Enums, etc)
- Joins
