**Sherlock Holmes** ([/ ˈ ʃ ɜːr l ɒ k ˈ h oʊ m z /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) is a [fictional detective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_fiction "Detective fiction") created by British author [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle "Arthur Conan Doyle"). Referring to himself as a " [consulting detective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator "Private investigator") " in his stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, [forensic science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science "Forensic science") and [logical reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning") that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including [Scotland Yard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard "Scotland Yard").

The character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887's *[A Study in Scarlet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet "A Study in Scarlet")*. His popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in *[The Strand Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine "The Strand Magazine")*, beginning with " [A Scandal in Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia "A Scandal in Bohemia") " in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling [four novels and 56 short stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Sherlock_Holmes "Canon of Sherlock Holmes"). All but one [^1] are set in the [Victorian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era") or [Edwardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardian_era "Edwardian era") eras between 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer, [Dr. John H. Watson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson "Dr. Watson"), who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of [221B Baker Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street "221B Baker Street"), London, where many of the stories begin.

Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.[^2] By the 1990s, over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions, and publications had featured the detective,[^3] and *[Guinness World Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records "Guinness World Records")* lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and television history.[^4] Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but an actual person;[^5] [^6] [^7] many literary and fan societies have been founded on [this pretence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlockian_game "Sherlockian game"). Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of [fandom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom "Fandom"), with the [Sherlock Holmes fandom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_fandom "Sherlock Holmes fandom") being one of the first cohesive fan communities in the world.[^8] The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on [mystery writing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_fiction "Detective fiction") and [popular culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture_references_to_Sherlock_Holmes "Popular culture references to Sherlock Holmes") as a whole, with the original tales, as well as thousands [written by authors other than Conan Doyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_pastiches "Sherlock Holmes pastiches"), being [adapted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_Sherlock_Holmes "Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes") into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930), Sherlock Holmes's creator, in 1914

[Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe "Edgar Allan Poe") 's [C. Auguste Dupin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Auguste_Dupin "C. Auguste Dupin") is generally acknowledged as the forerunner of the modern detective story in English fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes.[^9] Conan Doyle once wrote, "Each \[of Poe's detective stories\] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?" [^10] Similarly, the stories of [Émile Gaboriau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Gaboriau "Émile Gaboriau") 's [Monsieur Lecoq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Lecoq "Monsieur Lecoq") were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes's speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq.[^11] [^12] Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of *A Study in Scarlet*, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be "a very inferior fellow" and Lecoq to be "a miserable bungler".[^13]

Conan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of [Joseph Bell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bell "Joseph Bell"), a surgeon at the [Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Infirmary_of_Edinburgh "Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"), whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations.[^14] However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: "You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it".[^15] Sir [Henry Littlejohn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Littlejohn "Henry Littlejohn"), Chair of [Medical Jurisprudence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Jurisprudence "Medical Jurisprudence") at the [University of Edinburgh Medical School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh_Medical_School "University of Edinburgh Medical School"), is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.[^16]

Other possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as *Maximilien Heller*, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking [polymath](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") detective, operating in Paris.[^17] [^18] [^19] It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French.[^20]

## Biography

![[~/×/8db67bef8882f6478b3bc35832735664_MD5.jpg]]

The cover page of the 1887 edition of Beeton's Christmas Annual, which contains Holmes's first appearance ( A Study in Scarlet )

Details of Sherlock Holmes' life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.

A statement of Holmes' age in " [His Last Bow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Last_Bow "His Last Bow") " places his year of birth at 1853-1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age.[^21] His parents are not mentioned, although Holmes mentions that his "ancestors" were " [country squires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landed_gentry "Landed gentry") ". In " [The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Greek_Interpreter "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter") ", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was [Claude Joseph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Joseph_Vernet "Claude Joseph Vernet"), [Carle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carle_Vernet "Carle Vernet"), or [Horace Vernet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Vernet "Horace Vernet"). Holmes' brother [Mycroft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycroft_Holmes "Mycroft Holmes"), seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique [civil service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service "Civil service") position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. Sherlock describes his brother as the more intelligent of the two, but notes that Mycroft lacks any interest in physical investigation, preferring to spend his time at the [Diogenes Club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Club "Diogenes Club").[^22] [^23]

Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from his fellow university students.[^24] A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession.[^25]

Holmes (right) and Watson in a [Sidney Paget](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Paget "Sidney Paget") illustration for " [The Adventure of Silver Blaze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Silver_Blaze "The Adventure of Silver Blaze") "

In the first tale of Sherlock Holmes, *A Study in Scarlet*, financial difficulties lead Holmes and [Dr. Watson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson "Dr. Watson") to share rooms together at [221B Baker Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street "221B Baker Street"), London.[^26] Their residence is maintained by their landlady, [Mrs. Hudson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Hudson "Mrs. Hudson").[^27] Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years.[^28] Most of the stories are [frame narratives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_narrative "Frame narrative") written from Watson's point of view, as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the "science" of his craft:

> Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it \[*A Study in Scarlet*\] with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of [Euclid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid").... Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.[^29]

Nevertheless, when Holmes recorded a case himself, he was forced to concede that he could more easily understand the need to write it in a manner that would appeal to the public rather than his intention to focus on his own technical skill.[^30]

Holmes's friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be "quite superficial", Watson is moved by Holmes's reaction:

> It was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.[^31]

After confirming Watson's assessment of the wound, Holmes makes it clear to their opponent that the man would not have left the room alive if he genuinely had killed Watson.[^31]

### Practice

Holmes' clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy [aristocrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy "Aristocracy") and [industrialists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialist "Industrialist"), to impoverished [pawnbrokers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawnbroker "Pawnbroker") and [governesses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governess "Governess"). He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with [Scotland Yard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard "Scotland Yard"). However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raise Holmes's profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police [^32] that, Watson writes, by 1887 "Europe was ringing with his name" [^33] and by 1895 Holmes has "an immense practice".[^34] Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby.[^35] A [British prime minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom") [^36] and the [King of Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Bohemia "King of Bohemia") [^37] visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the [President of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France "President of France") awards him the [Legion of Honour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honour "Legion of Honour") for capturing an assassin;[^38] the King of Scandinavia is a client;[^39] and he aids the [Vatican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See") at least twice.[^40] The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times [^41] and declines a [knighthood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor "Knight Bachelor") "for services which may perhaps some day be described".[^42] However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work.[^43]

Holmes and [archenemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archenemy "Archenemy") Moriarty struggle at the [Reichenbach Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichenbach_Falls "Reichenbach Falls"); drawing by Sidney Paget

The first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind [Professor James Moriarty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Moriarty "Professor Moriarty") [^44] in " [The Final Problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Problem "The Final Problem") " (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that "my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel".[^45] However, the reaction of the public surprised him very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to *[The Strand Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine "The Strand Magazine")*, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest.[^46] Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with "You brute".[^46] Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes's death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporaneous source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949.[^47] However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes's death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.[^8]

After resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote *[The Hound of the Baskervilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles "The Hound of the Baskervilles")* (serialised in 1901–02, with an implicit setting before Holmes's death). In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote " [The Adventure of the Empty House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Empty_House "The Adventure of the Empty House") "; set in 1894, Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies.[^48] Following "The Adventure of the Empty House", Conan Doyle would sporadically write new Holmes stories until 1927. Holmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—between his disappearance and presumed death in "The Final Problem" and his reappearance in "The Adventure of the Empty House"—as the Great Hiatus.[^49] The earliest known use of this expression dates to 1946.[^50]

### Retirement

In *His Last Bow*, the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the [Sussex Downs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Downs "South Downs") and taken up [beekeeping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping "Beekeeping") as his primary occupation.[^51] The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in " [The Adventure of the Second Stain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Second_Stain "The Adventure of the Second Stain") ", first published that year).[^52] The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British [war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") effort. Only one other adventure, " [The Adventure of the Lion's Mane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Lion%27s_Mane "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane") ", takes place during the detective's retirement.[^53]

Holmes examining a bicycle with Watson standing behind in " [The Adventure of the Priory School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Priory_School "The Adventure of the Priory School") " from 1904. [Sidney Paget](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Paget "Sidney Paget") 's illustrations in *[The Strand Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine "The Strand Magazine")* iconicised both characters.

Watson describes Holmes as " [bohemian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism "Bohemianism") " in his habits and lifestyle.[^54] Said to have a "cat-like" love of personal cleanliness,[^55] at the same time Holmes is an [eccentric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_\(behavior\) "Eccentricity (behavior)") with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. Watson describes him as

> in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. \[He\] keeps his cigars in the [coal-scuttle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_scuttle "Coal scuttle"), his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece.... He had a horror of destroying documents.... Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.[^56]

While Holmes is characterised as dispassionate and cold, he can be animated and excitable during an investigation. He has a flair for showmanship, often keeping his methods and evidence hidden until the last possible moment so as to impress observers.[^57] Holmes is willing to break the law as a means for righting a wrong, contending that "there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge." [^58] His companion condones the detective's willingness to do this on behalf of a client—lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses—when he also feels it morally justifiable.[^59]

Except for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In ["The *Gloria Scott* "](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Gloria_Scott "The Adventure of the Gloria Scott"), he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: "I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson... I never mixed much with the men of my year." [^60] The detective goes without food at times of intense intellectual activity, believing that "the faculties become refined when you starve them".[^61] [^62] At times, Holmes relaxes with music, either playing the violin [^63] or enjoying the works of composers such as [Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner "Richard Wagner") [^64] and [Pablo de Sarasate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_de_Sarasate "Pablo de Sarasate").[^65]

### Drug use

1891 Paget portrait of Holmes smoking his pipe for " [The Man with the Twisted Lip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Twisted_Lip "The Man with the Twisted Lip") "

Holmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases.[^66] He sometimes uses [morphine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine "Morphine") and sometimes [cocaine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine "Cocaine"), the latter of which he injects in a seven-percent solution; both drugs [were legal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_United_Kingdom#History "Drug policy of the United Kingdom") in 19th-century England.[^67] [^68] [^69] As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes's [mental health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health "Mental health") and intellect.[^70] [^71] In " [The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Missing_Three-Quarter "The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter") ", Watson says that although he has "weaned" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is "not dead, but merely sleeping".[^72]

Watson and Holmes both smoke tobacco, in cigarettes, cigars, and [pipes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_pipe_\(tobacco\) "Smoking pipe (tobacco)"). Although his chronicler does not consider Holmes's smoking a vice *per se*, Watson—a physician—does criticise the detective for creating a "poisonous atmosphere" in their confined quarters.[^73] [^74]

### Finances

Holmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's solution, such as in " [The Adventure of the Speckled Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band "The Adventure of the Speckled Band") ", " [The Red-Headed League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red-Headed_League "The Red-Headed League") ", and " [The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Beryl_Coronet "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet") ". The detective states at one point that "My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether." In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate.[^75] In " [The Adventure of the Priory School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Priory_School "The Adventure of the Priory School") ", Holmes earns a £6,000 fee [^76] (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500).[^77] However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.[^78]

As Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, "Holmes is as inhuman as a [Babbage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage") 's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love." [^79] Holmes says of himself that he is "not a whole-souled admirer of womankind",[^80] and that he finds "the motives of women... inscrutable.... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes".[^81] In *[The Sign of Four](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four "The Sign of the Four")*, he says, "Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them", a feeling Watson notes as an "atrocious sentiment".[^82] In "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane", Holmes writes, "Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart." [^83] At the end of *The Sign of Four*, Holmes states that "love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement." [^84] Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that "I have never loved." [^85]

But while Watson says that the detective has an "aversion to women",[^86] he also notes Holmes as having "a peculiarly ingratiating way with \[them\]".[^87] Watson notes that their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his "remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent." [^88] In " [The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton") ", the detective becomes [engaged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement "Engagement") under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, abandoning the woman once he has the information he requires.[^89]

#### Irene Adler

[Irene Adler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Adler "Irene Adler") is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in " [A Scandal in Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia "A Scandal in Bohemia") ". Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who bests Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of [pastiche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche "Pastiche") writing.[^90] The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:

> To Sherlock Holmes she is always *the* woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.[^91]

Five years before the story's events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of [Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia "Bohemia") Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fiancée's family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case.[^92]

Shortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, *A Study in Scarlet* (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective's abilities:

> 1. Knowledge of Literature – nil.
> 2. Knowledge of Philosophy – nil.
> 3. Knowledge of Astronomy – nil.
> 4. Knowledge of Politics – Feeble.
> 5. Knowledge of Botany – Variable. Well up in [belladonna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna "Atropa belladonna"), [opium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium "Opium"), and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.
> 6. Knowledge of Geology – Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks, has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what [part of London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_London "Geology of London") he had received them.
> 7. Knowledge of Chemistry – Profound.
> 8. Knowledge of Anatomy – Accurate, but unsystematic.
> 9. Knowledge of [Sensational Literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_novel "Sensation novel") – Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.
> 10. Plays the violin well.
> 11. Is an expert [singlestick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlestick "Singlestick") player, boxer, and swordsman.
> 12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.[^93]

In *A Study in Scarlet*, Holmes claims to be unaware that the Earth revolves around the Sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one's ability to learn useful things.[^94] The later stories move away from this notion: in *[The Valley of Fear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_Fear "The Valley of Fear")*, he says, "All knowledge comes useful to the detective",[^95] and in "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane", the detective calls himself "an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles".[^96] Looking back on the development of the character in 1912, Conan Doyle wrote that "In the first one, the *Study in Scarlet*, \[Holmes\] was a mere calculating machine, but I had to make him more of an educated human being as I went on with him." [^97]

Despite Holmes's supposed ignorance of politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately recognises the true identity of the disguised "Count von Kramm".[^37] At the end of *A Study in Scarlet*, Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin").[^98] The detective cites [Hafez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez "Hafez"),[^99] [Goethe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"),[^100] as well as [a letter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaubert%27s_letters "Flaubert's letters") from [Gustave Flaubert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert "Gustave Flaubert") to [George Sand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sand "George Sand") in the original French.[^101] In *The Hound of the Baskervilles*, the detective recognises works by [Godfrey Kneller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Kneller "Godfrey Kneller") and [Joshua Reynolds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds "Joshua Reynolds"): "Watson won't allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy since our views upon the subject differ." [^102] In " [The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Bruce-Partington_Plans "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans") ", Watson says that "Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic [Motets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motet "Motet") of [Lassus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassus "Lassus") ", considered "the last word" on the subject — which must have been the result of an intensive and very specialized musicological study with no obvious application to the solution of criminal mysteries.[^103] [^104]

Holmes is a [cryptanalyst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalyst "Cryptanalyst"), telling Watson that "I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers." [^105] Holmes also demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in "A Scandal in Bohemia", luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that a woman will rush to save her most valued possession from a fire.[^106] Another example is in " [The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Blue_Carbuncle "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle") ", where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: "When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and [the 'Pink 'un'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_Times "The Sporting Times") protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager." [^107]

[Maria Konnikova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Konnikova "Maria Konnikova") points out in an interview with [D. J. Grothe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Grothe "D. J. Grothe") that Holmes practises what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never "multitasks". She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.[^108]

### Holmesian deduction

Sidney Paget illustration of Holmes examining a corpse for " [The Adventure of the Abbey Grange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Abbey_Grange "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange") "

Holmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks,[^109] pipes,[^110] and hats.[^111] For example, in "A Scandal in Bohemia", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had "a most clumsy and careless servant girl". When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:

> It is simplicity itself... my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.[^112]

In the first Holmes story, *A Study in Scarlet*, Dr. Watson compares Holmes to [C. Auguste Dupin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Auguste_Dupin "C. Auguste Dupin"), Edgar Allan Poe's fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in " [The Murders in the Rue Morgue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murders_in_the_Rue_Morgue "The Murders in the Rue Morgue") ", where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial." [^113] Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in " [The Cardboard Box](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Cardboard_Box "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box") " [^114] and " [The Adventure of the Dancing Men](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men "The Adventure of the Dancing Men") ".[^115]

Though the stories always refer to Holmes's intellectual detection method as " [deduction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") ", Holmes primarily relies on [abduction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning"): [inferring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") an explanation for observed details.[^116] [^117] [^118] "From a drop of water," he writes, "a logician could infer the possibility of an [Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") or a [Niagara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls "Niagara Falls") without having seen or heard of one or the other." [^119] However, Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detective's guiding principle, as he says in *The Sign of Four*, is: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." [^120]

Holmes follows [Sir Isaac Newton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Isaac_Newton "Sir Isaac Newton") 's rule of *"hypotheses non fingo"*, for instance commenting in " [A Scandal in Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia "A Scandal in Bohemia") ": "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."

Despite Holmes's remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard (this being a central theme of " [The Yellow Face](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Yellow_Face "The Adventure of the Yellow Face") ").[^121]

### Forensic science

19th-century Seibert microscope

Though Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.[^122] [^123]

The detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of [trace evidence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_evidence "Trace evidence") and other physical evidence, including latent prints (such as footprints, hoof prints, and shoe and tire impressions) to identify actions at a crime scene,[^124] using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals,[^125] utilizing [handwriting analysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questioned_document_examination "Questioned document examination") and [graphology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology "Graphology"),[^126] comparing [typewritten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") letters to expose a fraud,[^127] using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers,[^128] and analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders.[^129]

Because of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an [optical microscope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope "Optical microscope") at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses [analytical chemistry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry "Analytical chemistry") for [blood residue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_residue "Blood residue") analysis and [toxicology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology "Toxicology") to detect poisons; Holmes's home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in " [The Naval Treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Naval_Treaty "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty") ".[^130] [Ballistics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") feature in "The Adventure of the Empty House" when spent bullets are recovered to be matched with a suspected murder weapon, a practice which became regular police procedure only some fifteen years after the story was published.[^131]

Laura J. Snyder has examined Holmes's methods in the context of mid- to late-19th-century criminology, demonstrating that, while sometimes in advance of what official investigative departments were formally using at the time, they were based upon existing methods and techniques. For example, fingerprints were proposed to be distinct in Conan Doyle's day, and while Holmes used a thumbprint to solve a crime in " [The Adventure of the Norwood Builder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Norwood_Builder "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder") " (generally held to be set in 1895), the story was published in 1903, two years after [Scotland Yard's fingerprint bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Classification_System "Henry Classification System") opened.[^123] [^132] Though the effect of the Holmes stories on the development of forensic science has thus often been overstated, Holmes inspired future generations of forensic scientists to think scientifically and analytically.[^133]

### Disguises

Holmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise. In several stories (" [The Sign of Four](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_Four "The Sign of Four") ", " [The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton") ", " [The Man with the Twisted Lip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Twisted_Lip "The Man with the Twisted Lip") ", " [The Adventure of the Empty House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Empty_House "The Adventure of the Empty House") " and " [A Scandal in Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia "A Scandal in Bohemia") "), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others (" [The Adventure of the Dying Detective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dying_Detective "The Adventure of the Dying Detective") " and " [A Scandal in Bohemia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia "A Scandal in Bohemia") "), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, "The stage lost a fine actor... when \[Holmes\] became a specialist in crime." [^134]

[Guy Mankowski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Mankowski "Guy Mankowski") has said of Holmes that his ability to change his appearance to blend into any situation "helped him personify the idea of the English eccentric chameleon, in a way that prefigured the likes of [David Bowie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie") ".[^135]

### Agents

Until Watson's arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city's underclass. These agents included a variety of [informants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informants "Informants"), such as Langdale Pike, a "human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal",[^136] and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes's "agent in the huge criminal underworld of London".[^137] The best known of Holmes's agents are a group of street children he called "the [Baker Street Irregulars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_Irregulars "Baker Street Irregulars") ".[^138] [^139]

### Combat

British Army (Adams) Mark III, the type probably carried by Watson

#### Pistols

Holmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III [Adams revolver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont%E2%80%93Adams_revolver "Beaumont–Adams revolver"), issued to British troops during the 1870s).[^140] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in *The Hound of the Baskervilles*,[^141] and in "The Adventure of the Empty House", Watson [pistol-whips](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol-whip "Pistol-whip") Colonel [Sebastian Moran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Moran "Sebastian Moran").[^142] In " [The Problem of Thor Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Thor_Bridge "The Problem of Thor Bridge") ", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.

#### Other weapons

As a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane. He is described by Watson as an expert at [singlestick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlestick "Singlestick"),[^93] and uses his cane thrice as a weapon.[^143] In *A Study in Scarlet*, Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman,[^93] and in "The *Gloria Scott* ", the detective says he practised [fencing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing "Fencing") while at university.[^60] In several stories (" [A Case of Identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Case_of_Identity "A Case of Identity") ", "The Red-Headed League", " [The Adventure of the Six Napoleons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Six_Napoleons "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons") "), Holmes wields a [riding crop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_\(implement\) "Crop (implement)"), described in the latter story as his "favourite weapon".[^144]

#### Personal combat

Holmes outfighting Mr Woodley in " [The Solitary Cyclist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Solitary_Cyclist "The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist") "

The detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength. In " [The Yellow Face](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Yellow_Face "The Adventure of the Yellow Face") ", Holmes's chronicler says, "Few men were capable of greater muscular effort." [^145] In " [The Adventure of the Speckled Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band "The Adventure of the Speckled Band") ", Dr. Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half. Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, " 'If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again." [^146]

Holmes is an adept [bare-knuckle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing "Bare-knuckle boxing") fighter; " [The *Gloria Scott*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Gloria_Scott "The Adventure of the Gloria Scott") " mentions that Holmes boxed while at university.[^60] In [*The Sign of Four*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four "The Sign of the Four"), he introduces himself to McMurdo, a [prize fighter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing "Professional boxing"), as "the [amateur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing "Amateur boxing") who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back". McMurdo remembers: "Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy." [^147] In "The Yellow Face", Watson says: "He was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen." [^148] In "The Solitary Cyclist", Holmes visits a country [pub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub "Pub") to make enquiries regarding a certain Mr Woodley which results in violence. Mr Woodley, Holmes tells Watson,[^149]

> ... had been drinking his beer in the tap-room, and had heard the whole conversation. Who was I? What did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious backhander, which I failed to entirely avoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me. Mr. Woodley went home in a cart.[^149]

Another character subsequently refers to Mr Woodley as looking "much disfigured" as a result of his encounter with Holmes.[^150]

In " [The Adventure of the Empty House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Empty_House "The Adventure of the Empty House") ", Holmes tells Watson that he used a [Japanese martial art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_martial_arts "Japanese martial arts") known as [baritsu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritsu "Baritsu") to fling Moriarty to his death in the [Reichenbach Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichenbach_Falls "Reichenbach Falls").[^151] "Baritsu" is Conan Doyle's version of [bartitsu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartitsu "Bartitsu"), which combines [jujitsu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujitsu "Jujitsu") with boxing and [cane fencing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canne_de_combat "Canne de combat").[^152]

## Reception

The popularity of Sherlock Holmes became widespread after his first appearance in *[The Strand Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine "The Strand Magazine")* in 1891. This September 1917 edition of the magazine, with the cover story, "Sherlock Holmes outwits a German spy", could be posted to troops free of charge.

The first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels *[A Study in Scarlet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet "A Study in Scarlet")* (1887) and *[The Sign of the Four](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four "The Sign of the Four")* (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in *[The Strand Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine "The Strand Magazine")*. Holmes became widely known in Britain and America.[^2] The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story " [The Final Problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Problem "The Final Problem") ", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event. The *Strand* reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes's death.[^153] Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903.[^8] In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and [Alice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\) "Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)") from *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland")*) became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there.[^154]

Many fans of Sherlock Holmes have written letters to Holmes's address, [221B Baker Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street "221B Baker Street"). Though the address 221B Baker Street did not exist when the stories were first published, letters began arriving to the large [Abbey National](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_National "Abbey National") building which first encompassed that address almost as soon as it was built in 1932. Fans continue to send letters to Sherlock Holmes;[^155] these letters are now delivered to the [Sherlock Holmes Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_Museum "Sherlock Holmes Museum").[^156] Some of the people who have sent letters to 221B Baker Street believe Holmes is real.[^5] Members of the general public have also believed Holmes actually existed. In a 2008 survey of British teenagers, 58 per cent of respondents believed that Sherlock Holmes was a real person.[^6]

Scholarly discussion of Holmes has occasionally been written (usually facetiously) from the perspective of Holmes and Dr. Watson having existed; an example of this is the five critical essays, "Studies in Sherlock Holmes", by the author and essayist [Dorothy L. Sayers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_L._Sayers "Dorothy L. Sayers") in her 1946 non-fiction collection, *Unpopular Opinions*, including an article examining Watson's *signature* which was allegedly visible in some original *Strand* illustrations.[^157]

The Sherlock Holmes stories continue to be widely read.[^2] Holmes's continuing popularity has led to many reimaginings of the character in adaptations.[^8] *Guinness World Records*, which awarded Sherlock Holmes the title for "most portrayed literary human character in film & TV" in 2012, released a statement saying that the title "reflects his enduring appeal and demonstrates that his detective talents are as compelling today as they were 125 years ago".[^4]

### Honours

[Statue of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Sherlock_Holmes,_London "Statue of Sherlock Holmes, London") near [221B Baker Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street "221B Baker Street"), London

[Blue plaque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_plaque "Blue plaque") at The Sherlock Holmes Museum 221b Baker Street, London

The London [Metropolitan Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Railway "Metropolitan Railway") named one of its twenty [electric locomotives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Railway_electric_locomotives "Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives") deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes. He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as [Lord Byron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron "Lord Byron"), [Benjamin Disraeli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli "Benjamin Disraeli"), and [Florence Nightingale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale "Florence Nightingale").[^158]

A number of London streets are associated with Holmes. York Mews South, off Crawford Street, was renamed Sherlock Mews, and Watson's Mews is near Crawford Place.[^159] [The Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sherlock_Holmes "The Sherlock Holmes") is a [public house](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_house "Public house") in Northumberland Street in London which contains a large collection of memorabilia related to Holmes, the original collection having been put together for display in [Baker Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street "Baker Street") during the [Festival of Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Britain "Festival of Britain") in 1951.[^160] [^161]

In 2002, the [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Chemistry "Royal Society of Chemistry") bestowed an honorary fellowship on Holmes for his use of forensic science and analytical chemistry in popular literature, making him (as of 2024) the only fictional character thus honoured.[^162] Holmes has been commemorated many times on UK postage stamps issued by the [Royal Mail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail "Royal Mail"), most recently in their [August 2020 series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_commemorative_stamps_2020%E2%80%932029#2020 "Great Britain commemorative stamps 2020–2029") to celebrate the *Sherlock* television series.[^163]

There are multiple statues of Sherlock Holmes around the world. The first, sculpted by [John Doubleday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doubleday_\(sculptor\) "John Doubleday (sculptor)"), was unveiled in [Meiringen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiringen "Meiringen"), Switzerland, in September 1988. The second was unveiled in October 1988 in [Karuizawa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karuizawa "Karuizawa"), Japan, and was sculpted by Yoshinori Satoh. The third was installed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1989, and was sculpted by [Gerald Laing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Laing "Gerald Laing").[^164] In 1999, a [statue of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Sherlock_Holmes,_London "Statue of Sherlock Holmes, London") in London, also by John Doubleday, was unveiled near the fictional detective's address, 221B Baker Street.[^165] In 2001, a sculpture of Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle by [Irena Sedlecká](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irena_Sedleck%C3%A1 "Irena Sedlecká") was unveiled in a statue collection in Warwickshire, England.[^166] A sculpture depicting both Holmes and Watson was unveiled in 2007 in Moscow, Russia, based partially on [Sidney Paget](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Paget "Sidney Paget") 's illustrations and partially on the actors in *[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes_and_Dr._Watson "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson")*.[^167] In 2015, a sculpture of Holmes by [Jane DeDecker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_DeDecker "Jane DeDecker") was installed in the police headquarters of [Edmond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond,_Oklahoma "Edmond, Oklahoma"), Oklahoma, United States.[^168] In 2019, a statue of Holmes was unveiled in [Chester](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Illinois "Chester, Illinois"), Illinois, United States, as part of a series of statues honouring cartoonist [E. C. Segar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._C._Segar "E. C. Segar") and his characters. The statue is titled "Sherlock & Segar", and the face of the statue was modelled on Segar.[^169]

### Societies

In 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the [Baker Street Irregulars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baker_Street_Irregulars "The Baker Street Irregulars") (in New York) were founded. The latter is still active. The Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved later in the 1930s, but was succeeded by a society with a slightly different name, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951 and remains active.[^170] [^171] These societies were followed by many more, first in the US (where they are known as "scion societies"—offshoots—of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark. There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (such as [The Bootmakers of Toronto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootmakers_of_Toronto "The Bootmakers of Toronto")), India, and Japan.[^172] Fans tend to be called "Holmesians" in the UK and "Sherlockians" in the US,[^173] [^174] [^175] though recently "Sherlockian" has also come to refer to fans of the [Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_\(TV_series\) "Sherlock (TV series)") regardless of location.[^176]

## Legacy

Statue of Holmes in an [Inverness cape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_cape "Inverness cape") and a [deerstalker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deerstalker "Deerstalker") cap on Picardy Place in [Edinburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh") (Conan Doyle's birthplace)

Although Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with [Dr. Watson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson "Dr. Watson") in the Holmes stories. Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary [Professor Moriarty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Moriarty "Professor Moriarty"), and the use of forensic science to solve cases.[^2]

The Sherlock Holmes stories established crime fiction as a respectable genre popular with readers of all backgrounds, and Doyle's success inspired many contemporary detective stories.[^177] Holmes influenced the creation of other "eccentric [gentleman detective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_detective "Gentleman detective") " characters, like [Agatha Christie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie "Agatha Christie") 's fictional detective [Hercule Poirot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot "Hercule Poirot"), introduced in 1920.[^178] Holmes also inspired a number of anti-hero characters "almost as an antidote to the masterful detective", such as the [gentleman thief](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_thief "Gentleman thief") characters [A. J. Raffles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Raffles "A. J. Raffles") (created by [E. W. Hornung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Hornung "E. W. Hornung") in 1898) and [Arsène Lupin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin "Arsène Lupin") (created by [Maurice Leblanc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Leblanc "Maurice Leblanc") in 1905).[^177]

The phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character. However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are "elementary", and occasionally calls Watson "my dear Watson", the phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle.[^179] One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in " [The Adventure of the Crooked Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Crooked_Man "The Adventure of the Crooked Man") " (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: "'I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,' said he \[Holmes\]. \[...\] 'Excellent,' I \[Watson\] cried. 'Elementary,' said he." [^180] [^181] [^182]

[William Gillette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gillette "William Gillette") is widely considered to have originated the phrase with the formulation, "Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow", allegedly in his 1899 play *[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(play\) "Sherlock Holmes (play)")*. However, the script was [revised many times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(play\)#Revisions "Sherlock Holmes (play)") over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others.[^179] The appearance of the line "Elementary, my dear Potson" in a Sherlock Holmes parody from 1901 has led some authors to speculate that, rather than this being an incidental formulation, the parodist drew upon an already well-established occurrences of "Elementary, my dear Watson." [^183] [^184]

The exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909.[^179] [^185] It was also used by [P. G. Wodehouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._G._Wodehouse "P. G. Wodehouse") in his novel *[Psmith, Journalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psmith,_Journalist "Psmith, Journalist")*, which was first serialised in *[The Captain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Captain_\(magazine\) "The Captain (magazine)")* magazine between October 1909 and February 1910; the phrase occurred in the January 1910 instalment. The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in [the Rathbone-Bruce series of films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(1939_film_series\) "Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)") from 1939 to 1946.[^186]

Conan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the " [canon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Sherlock_Holmes "Canon of Sherlock Holmes") " by Holmes aficionados. The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially [Biblical criticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism") to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson's [literary agent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_agent "Literary agent"). From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon—such as the location of Watson's war wound, described as being in his shoulder in *A Study in Scarlet* and in his leg in *The Sign of Four* —and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses.[^187] [^188] [^189]

For example, one detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes's birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. [Christopher Morley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Morley "Christopher Morley") and [William Baring-Gould](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Baring-Gould "William Baring-Gould") contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in "His Last Bow" that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation.[^190] This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January.[^191] [^192] [Laurie R. King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._King "Laurie R. King") instead argues that details in "The *Gloria Scott* " (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885. If he began university at age 17, his birth year could be as late as 1868.[^193]

For the 1951 [Festival of Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Britain "Festival of Britain"), Holmes's [living room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_room "Living room") was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material. After the festival, items were transferred to [The Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sherlock_Holmes "The Sherlock Holmes") (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in [Lucens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucens "Lucens"), Switzerland, by the author's son, [Adrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Conan_Doyle "Adrian Conan Doyle"). Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public.[^194]

In 1969, the [Toronto Reference Library](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Reference_Library "Toronto Reference Library") began a collection of materials related to Conan Doyle. Stored today in Room 221B, this vast collection is accessible to the public.[^195] Similarly, in 1974 the [University of Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota "University of Minnesota") founded a collection that is now "the world's largest gathering of material related to Sherlock Holmes and his creator". Access is closed to the general public, but is occasionally open to tours.[^196] [^197]

In 1990, the [Sherlock Holmes Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_Museum "Sherlock Holmes Museum") opened on Baker Street in London, followed the next year by a museum in [Meiringen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiringen "Meiringen") (near the Reichenbach Falls) dedicated to the detective.[^194] A private Conan Doyle collection is a permanent exhibit at the [Portsmouth City Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_City_Museum "Portsmouth City Museum"), where the author lived and worked as a physician.[^198]

### Postcolonial criticism

The Sherlock Holmes stories have been scrutinized by a few academics for themes of empire and colonialism.

Susan Cannon Harris claims that themes of contagion and containment are common in the Holmes series, including the metaphors of Eastern foreigners as the root cause of "infection" within and around Europe.[^199] Lauren Raheja, writing in the Marxist journal *Nature, Society, and Thought*, claims that Doyle used these characteristics to paint eastern colonies in a negative light, through their continually being the source of threats. For example, in one story, Doyle makes mention of the [Sumatran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra") cannibals (also known as [Batak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batak "Batak")) who throw poisonous darts, and in "The Speckled Band", a "long residence in the tropics" was a negative influence on one antagonist's bad temper.[^200] Yumna Siddiqi argues that Doyle depicted returned colonials as "marginal, physically ravaged characters that threaten the peace", while putting non-colonials in a much more positive light.[^201]

The popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known [pastiche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche "Pastiche") dates from 1891. Titled "My Evening with Sherlock Holmes", it was written by Conan Doyle's close friend [J. M. Barrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie "J. M. Barrie").[^202]

Adaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in [Laurie R. King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._King "Laurie R. King") 's [Mary Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_\(character\) "Mary Russell (character)") series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series *[Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_in_the_22nd_Century "Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century")*, and is meshed with the setting of [H. P. Lovecraft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft "H. P. Lovecraft") 's [Cthulhu Mythos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos "Cthulhu Mythos") in [Neil Gaiman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman "Neil Gaiman") 's " [A Study in Emerald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Emerald "A Study in Emerald") " (which won the 2004 [Hugo Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award "Hugo Award") for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was [Nicholas Meyer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Meyer "Nicholas Meyer") 's *[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven-Per-Cent_Solution "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution")*, a 1974 *[New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* bestselling novel (made into the 1976 [film of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven-Per-Cent_Solution_\(film\) "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)")) in which Holmes's cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It served to popularize the trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as [Oscar Wilde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde "Oscar Wilde"), [Aleister Crowley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley "Aleister Crowley"), [Sigmund Freud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"), or [Jack the Ripper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper "Jack the Ripper")) into Holmesian pastiches, something Conan Doyle himself never did.[^203] [^204] [^205] Another common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the " [giant rat of Sumatra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_rat_of_Sumatra "Giant rat of Sumatra"), a story for which the world is not yet prepared" in " [The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Sussex_Vampire "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire") ").[^206]

The first translation of a Sherlock Holmes story into a Chinese variety was done by *Chinese Progress* in 1896. That publication rendered the name as 呵爾唔斯, which would be 呵尔唔斯 in [Simplified Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese "Simplified Chinese") and Hē'ěrwúsī in [Modern Standard Mandarin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Mandarin "Modern Standard Mandarin"). Shanghai Civilization Books later issued versions rendering Holmes's name differently, as 福爾摩斯 in [Traditional Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"), which would be 福尔摩斯 in Simplified Chinese and Fú'ěrmósī in Modern Standard Mandarin; this version became the common way of rendering "Holmes" in Chinese languages.[^207]

In addition to the [Holmes canon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Sherlock_Holmes "Canon of Sherlock Holmes"), Conan Doyle wrote other material featuring Holmes, especially plays: 1899's *[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(play\) "Sherlock Holmes (play)")* (with [William Gillette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gillette "William Gillette")), 1910's *[The Speckled Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speckled_Band_\(play\) "The Speckled Band (play)")*, and 1921's *The Crown Diamond* (the basis for " [The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Mazarin_Stone "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone") ").[^208] These and other Holmes-related but non-canonical works have been collected in several works released since Conan Doyle's death.[^209]

In terms of writers other than Conan Doyle, authors as diverse as [Agatha Christie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie "Agatha Christie"), [Anthony Burgess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Burgess "Anthony Burgess"), [Neil Gaiman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman "Neil Gaiman"), [Dorothy B. Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_B._Hughes "Dorothy B. Hughes"), [Stephen King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King "Stephen King"), [Tanith Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanith_Lee "Tanith Lee"), [A. A. Milne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Milne "A. A. Milne"), and [P. G. Wodehouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._G._Wodehouse "P. G. Wodehouse") have all written Sherlock Holmes [pastiches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiches "Pastiches"). Contemporary with Conan Doyle, [Maurice Leblanc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Leblanc "Maurice Leblanc") directly featured Holmes in his popular series about the [gentleman thief](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_thief "Gentleman thief"), [Arsène Lupin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin "Arsène Lupin"), though legal objections from Conan Doyle forced Leblanc to modify the name to "Herlock Sholmes" in reprints and [later stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin_versus_Herlock_Sholmes "Arsène Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes").[^210] Mystery writer [John Dickson Carr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr "John Dickson Carr") collaborated with Arthur Conan Doyle's son, [Adrian Conan Doyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Conan_Doyle "Adrian Conan Doyle"), on *[The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exploits_of_Sherlock_Holmes "The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes")*, a pastiche collection from 1954.[^211] In 2011, [Anthony Horowitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Horowitz "Anthony Horowitz") published a Sherlock Holmes novel, *[The House of Silk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_Silk "The House of Silk")*, presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle's work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate;[^212] a follow-up, *[Moriarty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriarty_\(novel\) "Moriarty (novel)")*, appeared in 2014.[^213] The "MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories" series of pastiches, edited by David Marcum and published by MX Publishing, contains fifty-two volumes and features hundreds of stories echoing the original canon which were compiled for the restoration of [Undershaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undershaw "Undershaw") and the support of Stepping Stones School, now housed in it.[^214] [^215]

In 1980's *[The Name of the Rose](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose "The Name of the Rose")*, Italian author [Umberto Eco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco "Umberto Eco") creates a Sherlock Holmes of the 1320s in the form of a Franciscan friar and main protagonist named Brother [William of Baskerville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Baskerville "William of Baskerville"), his name a clear reference to Holmes per *[The Hound of the Baskervilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles "The Hound of the Baskervilles")*.[^216] Brother William investigates a series of murders in the abbey alongside his novice Adso of Melk, who acts as his [Dr. Watson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson "Dr. Watson"). Furthermore, Umberto Eco's description of Brother William bears marked similarities in both physique and personality to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's description of Sherlock Holmes in *[A Study in Scarlet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet "A Study in Scarlet")*.[^217]

[Laurie R. King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._King "Laurie R. King") recreated Holmes in her [Mary Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_\(character\) "Mary Russell (character)") series (beginning with 1994's *[The Beekeeper's Apprentice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beekeeper%27s_Apprentice "The Beekeeper's Apprentice")*), set during the First World War and the 1920s. Her Holmes, semi-retired in Sussex, meets a teenage American girl. Recognising a kindred spirit, he trains her as his apprentice and subsequently marries her. As of 2024, the series includes eighteen base novels and additional writings.[^218]

*[The Final Solution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Solution_\(novel\) "The Final Solution (novel)")*, a 2004 novella by [Michael Chabon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chabon "Michael Chabon"), concerns an unnamed but long-retired detective interested in [beekeeping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping "Beekeeping") who tackles the case of a missing parrot belonging to a Jewish refugee boy.[^219] [Mitch Cullin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Cullin "Mitch Cullin") 's novel *[A Slight Trick of the Mind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Slight_Trick_of_the_Mind "A Slight Trick of the Mind")* (2005) takes place two years after the end of the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") and explores an old and frail Sherlock Holmes (now 93) as he comes to terms with a life spent in emotionless logic;[^220] this was also adapted into a film, 2015's *[Mr. Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Holmes "Mr. Holmes")*.[^221]

#### Minor characters

Some authors have written tales centred on characters from the canon other than Holmes. Anthologies edited by [Michael Kurland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kurland "Michael Kurland") and [George Mann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mann_\(writer\) "George Mann (writer)") are entirely devoted to stories told from the perspective of characters other than Holmes and Watson. [John Gardner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gardner_\(British_writer\) "John Gardner (British writer)"), Michael Kurland, and [Kim Newman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Newman "Kim Newman"), amongst many others, have all written tales in which Holmes's nemesis [Professor Moriarty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Moriarty "Professor Moriarty") is the main character. [Mycroft Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycroft_Holmes "Mycroft Holmes") has been the subject of several efforts: *Enter the Lion* by [Michael P. Hodel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_P._Hodel "Michael P. Hodel") and Sean M. Wright (1979),[^222] a four-book series by [Quinn Fawcett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Fawcett "Quinn Fawcett"),[^223] and 2015's *[Mycroft Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycroft_Holmes_\(novel\) "Mycroft Holmes (novel)")*, by [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar") and Anna Waterhouse.[^224] [M. J. Trow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._J._Trow "M. J. Trow") has written a series of seventeen books using [Inspector Lestrade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Lestrade "Inspector Lestrade") as the central character, beginning with *The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade* in 1985.[^225] [Carole Nelson Douglas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Nelson_Douglas "Carole Nelson Douglas") ' Irene Adler series is based on "the woman" from "A Scandal in Bohemia", with the first book (1990's *Good Night, Mr. Holmes*) retelling that story from Adler's point of view.[^226] [Martin Davies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Davies_\(writer\) "Martin Davies (writer)") has written three novels where Baker Street housekeeper [Mrs. Hudson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Hudson "Mrs. Hudson") is the protagonist.[^227]

#### Parodies

A popular form of Holmesian pastiche is the [parody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody "Parody"). "My Evening with Sherlock Holmes", by [J. M. Barrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie "J. M. Barrie"), was released in 1891, four years after Holmes first appearance in print and four months after “A Scandal in Bohemia” appeared in *The Strand*; it is generally considered a parody.[^202] [^228] Many others soon followed, with the protagonists often given thinly veiled names such as Sherlaw Kombs (by [Robert Barr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Barr_\(writer\) "Robert Barr (writer)")),[^229] Picklock Holes (by [R. C. Lehmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._C._Lehmann "R. C. Lehmann")), Shamrock Jolnes (by [O. Henry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Henry "O. Henry")), Holmlock Shears, Shylock Homes, and so on.[^230]

Conan Doyle himself contributed to this style, with 1898's " [The Lost Special](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Special "The Lost Special") " featuring an unnamed "amateur reasoner" intended to be identified by his readers as Holmes. The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. Similar Conan Doyle short stories are " [The Field Bazaar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Field_Bazaar "The Field Bazaar") ", "The Man with the Watches", and 1924's " [How Watson Learned the Trick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Watson_Learned_the_Trick "How Watson Learned the Trick") ", a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes.[^209]

In 1944, American mystery writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee (writing under their joint pseudonym [Ellery Queen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellery_Queen "Ellery Queen")) published *[The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misadventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes "The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes")*, a collection of thirty-three pastiches written by various well-known authors, featuring many parodies.[^231] [^232]

#### Scholarly works

There have been many scholarly works dealing with Sherlock Holmes, some working within the bounds of the Great Game, and some written from the perspective that Holmes is a fictional character. In particular, there have been three major annotated editions of the complete series. The first was William Baring-Gould's 1967 *The Annotated Sherlock Holmes*. This two-volume set was ordered to fit Baring-Gould's preferred chronology, and was written from a Great Game perspective. The second was 1993's *The Oxford Sherlock Holmes* (general editor: [Owen Dudley Edwards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Dudley_Edwards "Owen Dudley Edwards")), a nine-volume set written in a straight scholarly manner. The most recent is [Leslie Klinger's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_S._Klinger "Leslie S. Klinger") *[The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Annotated_Sherlock_Holmes "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes")* (2004–05), a three-volume set that returns to a Great Game perspective.[^233] [^234]

Poster for the 1899 play *[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(play\) "Sherlock Holmes (play)")* by Conan Doyle and actor William Gillette

In 2012, *[Guinness World Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records "Guinness World Records")* listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions.[^4]

The 1899 play *[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(play\) "Sherlock Holmes (play)")*, by Conan Doyle and [William Gillette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gillette "William Gillette"), was a synthesis of several Conan Doyle stories. In addition to its popularity, the play is significant because it, rather than the original stories, introduced one of the key visual qualities commonly associated with Holmes today: his [calabash pipe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_pipe#Calabash "Tobacco pipe");[^235] the play also formed the basis for Gillette's 1916 film, *[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(1916_film\) "Sherlock Holmes (1916 film)")*. Gillette performed as Holmes some 1,300 times. In the early 1900s, [H. A. Saintsbury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._A._Saintsbury "H. A. Saintsbury") took over the role from Gillette for a tour of the play. Between this play and Conan Doyle's own stage adaptation of " [The Adventure of the Speckled Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band "The Adventure of the Speckled Band") ", Saintsbury portrayed Holmes over 1,000 times.[^236]

[Basil Rathbone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rathbone "Basil Rathbone") as Holmes

Holmes's first screen appearance was in the 1900 [Mutoscope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutoscope "Mutoscope") film, *[Sherlock Holmes Baffled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_Baffled "Sherlock Holmes Baffled")*.[^237] From 1921 to 1923, [Eille Norwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eille_Norwood "Eille Norwood") played Holmes in [forty-seven silent films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(Stoll_film_series\) "Sherlock Holmes (Stoll film series)") (45 shorts and two features), in a series of performances that Conan Doyle spoke highly of.[^3] [^238] 1929's *[The Return of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Sherlock_Holmes_\(1929_film\) "The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)")* was the first sound title to feature Holmes.[^239] From 1939 to 1946, [Basil Rathbone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rathbone "Basil Rathbone") played Holmes and [Nigel Bruce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Bruce "Nigel Bruce") played Watson in [fourteen US films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(1939_film_series\) "Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)") (two for [20th Century Fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox "20th Century Fox") and a dozen for [Universal Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures "Universal Pictures")) and in *[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes "The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes")* radio show. While the Fox films were period pieces, the Universal films abandoned Victorian Britain and moved to a then-contemporary setting in which Holmes occasionally battled [Nazis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").[^240]

Holmes in two television adaptations: L–R: [Jeremy Brett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Brett "Jeremy Brett") in *[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(1984_TV_series\) "Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)")* (1984) and [Benedict Cumberbatch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Cumberbatch "Benedict Cumberbatch") in *[Sherlock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_\(TV_series\) "Sherlock (TV series)")* (2010)

In the series, created by [Mark Gatiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gatiss "Mark Gatiss") and [Steven Moffat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat "Steven Moffat"), the stories' original [Victorian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era") setting is replaced by present-day London, with Watson a veteran of the modern [War in Afghanistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\(2001%E2%80%93present\) "War in Afghanistan (2001–present)").[^253] Similarly, *[Elementary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_\(TV_series\) "Elementary (TV series)")* premiered on [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") in 2012 and ran for seven seasons until 2019.

### Copyright issues

The copyright for Conan Doyle's works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle's death.[^261] [^262] In the United Kingdom, it was revived in 1996 due to [new provisions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Duration_Directive "Copyright Duration Directive") harmonising UK law with that of the European Union, and expired again at the end of 2000 (seventy years after Conan Doyle's death).[^263] The author's works are now in the [public domain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain "Public domain") in those countries.[^264] [^265]

In the United States, all works published before 1923 entered public domain by 1998, but, as ten Holmes stories were published after that date, the Conan Doyle estate maintained that the Holmes and Watson characters as a whole were still under copyright.[^262] [^266] In 2013, [Leslie S. Klinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_S._Klinger "Leslie S. Klinger") (lawyer and editor of *The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes*) [sued the Conan Doyle estate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinger_v._Conan_Doyle_Estate,_Ltd. "Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate, Ltd.") in order to have the characters of Holmes and Watson declared public domain in the United States. Klinger was successful: as a result, the only stories still under copyright in the US due to the ruling, as of that time, were those collected in *[The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case-Book_of_Sherlock_Holmes "The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes")* other than " [The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Mazarin_Stone "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone") " and " [The Problem of Thor Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Thor_Bridge "The Problem of Thor Bridge") ": a total of ten stories.[^265] [^267] [^268]

In 2020, although the United States court ruling and the passage of time meant that most of the Holmes stories and characters were in the public domain in that country, the Doyle estate legally challenged the use of Sherlock Holmes in the film *[Enola Holmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Holmes_\(film\) "Enola Holmes (film)")* in a complaint filed in the United States.[^269] The Doyle estate alleged that the film depicts Holmes with personality traits that were only exhibited by the character in the stories still under copyright.[^270] [^271] On 18 December 2020, the lawsuit was [dismissed with prejudice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissed_with_prejudice "Dismissed with prejudice") by [stipulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipulation "Stipulation") of all parties.[^272] [^273]

The remaining ten Holmes stories moved out of copyright in the United States between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2023, leaving the stories and characters completely in the public domain in the US as of the latter date.[^274] [^275] [^276]
