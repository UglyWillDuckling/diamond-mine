  To remove a primary key (PK) column from a table in PostgreSQL, you can use
  the following SQL command:

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;

  •  table_name  is the name of the table that you want to modify.
  •  constraint_name  is the name of the primary key constraint that you want
  to drop

  You can find the name of the primary key constraint by running the following
  command:
	`\d table_name`

  This will display the schema of the table, including the names of the
  constraints.

  Once you've dropped the primary key constraint, you can then drop the column
  itself using the following command:

    ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;

  •  `column_name`  is the name of the column that you want to drop.

  **Note**: Be careful when dropping columns and constraints, as this can affect
  the integrity of your data and the behavior of your application. Make sure
  to back up your data and test your changes carefully before applying them to
  a production database.

### single step 

  Also, if you want to drop a primary key constraint and column in a **single  step**, you can use the following command:
```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name CASCADE;
```

  ==This will drop the column and any dependent objects, including the primary==
  ==key constraint.== 
  However, **be** **careful** when using the  CASCADE  option, as it can have `unintended` consequences if you're not careful.
