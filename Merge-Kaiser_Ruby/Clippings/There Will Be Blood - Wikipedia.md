***There Will Be Blood*** is a 2007 American [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film "Epic film") [period drama film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama "Historical drama") written and directed by [Paul Thomas Anderson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson "Paul Thomas Anderson"), loosely based on the 1927 novel *[Oil!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil! "Oil!")* by [Upton Sinclair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair "Upton Sinclair").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It stars [Daniel Day-Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis "Daniel Day-Lewis"), [Paul Dano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dano "Paul Dano"), [Kevin J. O'Connor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_J._O%27Connor_\(actor\) "Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)"), [Ciarán Hinds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_Hinds "Ciarán Hinds"), and [Dillon Freasier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon_Freasier "Dillon Freasier"). The film follows [silver miner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_mining "Silver mining") -turned- [oilman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oilman "Oilman") Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) as he embarks on a ruthless quest for wealth during the [Californian oil boom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_oil_in_California_through_1930 "History of oil in California through 1930") in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Development on *There Will Be Blood* began after writer [Eric Schlosser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schlosser "Eric Schlosser") purchased the film rights to Sinclair's novel in 2004. It was acquired by [Ghoulardi Film Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson "Paul Thomas Anderson"), [Paramount Vantage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Vantage "Paramount Vantage") and [Miramax Films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax "Miramax") after Anderson completed the first draft of the film's screenplay. Day-Lewis immediately joined the project while Dano, who initially signed on for a smaller role, took on a starring role after replacing [Kel O'Neill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kel_O%27Neill "Kel O'Neill") during filming. [Principal photography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography "Principal photography") began in June 2006 and lasted until that September, with filming locations including Los Angeles and [Marfa, Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfa,_Texas "Marfa, Texas"). The film's music was composed by [Radiohead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead "Radiohead") guitarist [Jonny Greenwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Greenwood "Jonny Greenwood").

*There Will Be Blood* premiered at [Fantastic Fest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Fest "Fantastic Fest") in [Austin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas "Austin, Texas") on September 29, 2007. It was first theatrically released in New York City and Los Angeles on December 26 and in selected international markets on January 25, 2008. It grossed $76.1 million worldwide and received acclaim from critics, with praise for the cinematography, Anderson's direction, screenplay, music, and performances of Day-Lewis and Dano. The [National Board of Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review:_Top_Ten_Films#2000s "National Board of Review: Top Ten Films"), the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute_Awards_2007 "American Film Institute Awards 2007") and the [National Society of Film Critics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society_of_Film_Critics "National Society of Film Critics") named *There Will Be Blood* one of the top-ten films of 2007. The film was nominated for eight awards at the [80th Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_Academy_Awards "80th Academy Awards"), winning two ([Best Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor "Academy Award for Best Actor") for Day-Lewis and [Best Cinematography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography "Academy Award for Best Cinematography") for [Elswit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Elswit "Robert Elswit")) and received numerous [other accolades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Accolades). It has since been widely regarded as one of the [greatest films of the 21st century and of all time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_voted_the_best "List of films voted the best").

In 1898, Daniel Plainview finds silver while prospecting in [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory "New Mexico Territory") but breaks his leg. Dragging himself from the pit, he takes a sample to an assay office and receives a silver and gold [claim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_claim "Land claim"). In 1902, [he discovers oil in California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_oil_in_California_through_1930 "History of oil in California through 1930"). Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son, H.W., who becomes his partner, allowing Daniel to present himself as a family man.

In 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit in Little Boston. Daniel visits the Sundays' property in Little Boston and meets Paul's twin brother Eli, a preacher. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price under the ruse of using it to hunt quail, but his motives are questioned by Eli, who knows the land has oil. In exchange for the property, Eli demands $10,000 for his church. An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, except for the land owned by one holdout, William Bandy.

After Daniel reneges on an agreement to let Eli bless the well before drilling begins, a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a [gas blowout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_\(well_drilling\) "Blowout (well drilling)") deafens H.W. and destroys the drilling infrastructure. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for having trusted Daniel.

A man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Later that night H.W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Daniel sends H.W. to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. [Standard Oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil "Standard Oil") offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but Daniel refuses and instead strikes a deal with [Union Oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Oil "Union Oil") to build a pipeline. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment.

Daniel becomes suspicious of Henry after he fails to recognize a childhood joke and confronts him one night at gunpoint. "Henry" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of [tuberculosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis "Tuberculosis"), and that he had impersonated Henry in the hope that Daniel could give him a job. An enraged Daniel murders him and buries his body. Daniel drinks and weeps. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants him to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for an [easement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easement "Easement") to run his pipeline across the ranch. As part of his [baptism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism "Baptism"), Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his child. Later, while the pipeline is being built, H.W. reunites with Daniel and Eli becomes a missionary.

In 1927, H.W. marries Paul and Eli's sister Mary. Daniel, now extremely wealthy but an alcoholic, lives alone in a large mansion. H.W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can move to Mexico with Mary and start his own drilling company. Daniel angrily mocks H.W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins and disowning him as his son. H.W. finally leaves after thanking God he is not related to Daniel. Eli, now a radio preacher, visits a drunken Daniel in the [bowling alley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_alley "Bowling alley") set up in his basement. Eli asks Daniel to partner with the church in drilling Bandy's property. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith. Once Eli acquiesces, Daniel reveals that he already drained the property of its oil supply by [capture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_capture "Rule of capture") and taunts Eli for his misfortune. Daniel torments Eli further by telling him a lie about how he gave his brother $10,000 instead and is now a wealthy man. He chases Eli around the alley and bludgeons him to death with a bowling pin. When his butler appears to investigate the commotion, Daniel announces, "I'm finished."

Critics see the film as a commentary on the nature of [capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") and greed, and its inherent national presence in America.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> [David Denby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Denby "David Denby") of *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* described the film as being about "the driving force of capitalism as it both creates and destroys the future" and goes on to say that "this movie is about the vanishing American frontier. The thrown-together buildings look scraggly and unkempt, the homesteaders are modest, stubborn, and reticent, but, in their undreamed-of future, [Wal-Mart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart "Walmart") is on the way." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Daniel Plainview's "I have a competition in me" speech has been looked upon as important when analyzing the film from this angle.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

Others have noted themes of faith, religion, and family.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> James Christopher of *The Times* viewed the film as "a biblical parable about America's failure to square religion and greed." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

On [review aggregator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), *There Will Be Blood* has an approval rating of 91% based on 245 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Widely touted as a masterpiece, this sparse and sprawling epic about the underhanded 'heroes' of capitalism boasts incredible performances by leads Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano, and is director Paul Thomas Anderson's best work to date." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> On [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), the film has a [weighted average](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_average "Weighted average") score of 93 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup>

[Andrew Sarris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris "Andrew Sarris") called the film "an impressive achievement in its confident expertness in rendering the simulated realities of a bygone time and place, largely with an inspired use of regional amateur actors and extras with all the right moves and sounds." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Sarris-42"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> In *[Premiere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_\(magazine\) "Premiere (magazine)")*, [Glenn Kenny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Kenny "Glenn Kenny") praised Day-Lewis's performance: "Once his Plainview takes wing, the relentless focus of the performance makes the character unique." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Kenny-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> [Manohla Dargis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohla_Dargis "Manohla Dargis") wrote, in her review for *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")*, "the film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dargis-44"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup>

*[Esquire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_\(magazine\) "Esquire (magazine)")* praised Day-Lewis' performance: "what's most fun, albeit in a frightening way, is watching this greedmeister become more and more unhinged as he locks horns with Eli Sunday... both Anderson and Day-Lewis go for broke. But it's a pleasure to be reminded, if only once every four years, that subtlety can be overrated." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dangelo-45"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> [Richard Schickel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schickel "Richard Schickel") in *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* praised *There Will Be Blood* as "one of the most wholly original American movies ever made." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Schickel-46"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> Critic Tom Charity, writing about [CNN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN "CNN") 's ten-best films list, calls the film the only "flat-out masterpiece" of 2007.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Charity-47"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>

Schickel also named the film one of the Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at No. 9, calling Daniel Day-Lewis' performance "astonishing", and calling the film "a mesmerizing meditation on the American spirit in all its maddening ambiguities: mean and noble, angry and secretive, hypocritical and more than a little insane in its aspirations." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> James Christopher, chief film critic for *[The Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")*, published a list in April 2008 of his top 100 films, placing *There Will Be Blood* in second place, behind only *[Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_\(film\) "Casablanca (film)")*.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup>

Some critics were positive toward the work but less laudatory, often criticizing its ending. [Mick LaSalle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_LaSalle "Mick LaSalle") of the *[San Francisco Chronicle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle "San Francisco Chronicle")*, challenged the film's high praise by saying "there should be no need to pretend *There Will Be Blood* is a masterpiece just because Anderson sincerely tried to make it one" and noting that "the scenes between Day-Lewis and Dano ultimately degenerate into a ridiculous [burlesque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque "Burlesque") ".<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-SFCreview-50"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>

[Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") assigned the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, " *There Will Be Blood* is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by *[No Country for Old Men](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men "No Country for Old Men")*, and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But *There Will Be Blood* is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup>

Carla Meyer of the *[Sacramento Bee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Bee "Sacramento Bee")*, who gave the film the same star rating as Ebert, opined that the final confrontation between Daniel and Eli marked when the work "stops being a masterpiece and becomes a really good movie. What was grand becomes petty, then overwrought." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-52"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2014, Peter Walker of *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* likewise argued that the scene "might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema... but it's perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup>

Several months after LaSalle's initial review of the film, he reiterated that while he still did not consider *There Will Be Blood* to be a masterpiece, he wondered if its "style, an approach, an attitude... might become important in the future." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maximum_Strength_Mick-54"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> Since 2008, the film has been included in the book *[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Movies_You_Must_See_Before_You_Die "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die")* and every revised edition released afterwards.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-55"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> *[Total Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Film "Total Film")* placed it at number three in their list of the 50 best movies of *Total Film* 's lifetime.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-56"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> In *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")*, journalist Steve Rose ranked it the 17th best arthouse film of all time, and in a separate 2019 ranking a panel of four *Guardian* journalists ranked it the best film of the 21st century.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-57"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-58"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2024, filmmaker [Quentin Tarantino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino "Quentin Tarantino") named it one of the best films of the 21st century.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-59"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup>

The film was on the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") 's 10 Movies of the Year; AFI's jury said:

> *There Will Be Blood* is bravura film-making by one of American film's modern masters. Paul Thomas Anderson's epic poem of savagery, optimism and obsession is a true meditation on America. The film drills down into the dark heart of capitalism, where domination, not gain, is the ultimate goal. In a career defined by transcendent performances, Daniel Day-Lewis creates a character so rich and so towering, that "Daniel Plainview" will haunt the history of film for generations to come.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-60"><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup>

The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Metacritic07-Top10-61"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-MovieCityNews-62"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup>

Review aggregator site [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), when comparing over 40 'top ten of the decade' lists from various notable publications, found *There Will Be Blood* to be the most mentioned, appearing on 46% of critics' lists and being ranked the decade's best film on five of them.

In December 2009, Peter Travers of *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* chose the film as the No. 1 film of the decade, saying:

> Two years after first seeing *There Will Be Blood*, I am convinced that Paul Thomas Anderson's profound portrait of an American primitive—take that, *[Citizen Kane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane "Citizen Kane")* —deserves pride of place among the decade's finest. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to "drink the milkshake" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than *[Boogie Nights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boogie_Nights "Boogie Nights")* and *[Magnolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_\(film\) "Magnolia (film)")* —his rebel cries from the 1990s— *Blood* let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by [Radiohead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead "Radiohead") 's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on *Blood*, I'll quote Plainview: "It was one goddamn hell of a show." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-65"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup>

*[Chicago Tribune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune "Chicago Tribune")* and *[At the Movies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Movies_\(1986_TV_program\) "At the Movies (1986 TV program)")* critic [Michael Phillips](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phillips_\(critic\) "Michael Phillips (critic)") named *There Will Be Blood* the decade's best film. Phillips stated:

> This most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a [Horatio Alger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger "Horatio Alger") story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the film's hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what I think is the performance of the new century— *There Will Be Blood* stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good!<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-66"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup>

*[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")* critic Lisa Schwarzbaum named *There Will Be Blood* the decade's best film as well. In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:

> Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, *There Will Be Blood* is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church—and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat—nor for brilliance.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-67"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup>

In December 2009, the website [Gawker.com](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker.com "Gawker.com") determined that *There Will Be Blood* is film critics' consensus best film of the decade when aggregating all Best of the Decade lists, stating: "And when the votes were all in, by a nose, *There Will Be Blood* stood alone at the top of the decade, its straw in the whole damn cinema's milkshake." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-68"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup>
