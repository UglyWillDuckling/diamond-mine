**Belize** <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> is a country on the north-eastern coast of [Central America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America"). It is bordered by [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico") to the north, the [Caribbean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea "Caribbean Sea") to the east, and [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") to the west and south. It also shares a [maritime boundary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_boundary "Maritime boundary") with [Honduras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras") to the southeast. Part of the [Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean") region, Belize is a member of the [Caribbean Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Community "Caribbean Community") (CARICOM) and the [Commonwealth Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Caribbean "Commonwealth Caribbean"), the historical [British West Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indies "British West Indies").

The [Maya civilization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization") spread into the area of Belize between 1500 BCE and 300 CE and flourished until about 1200.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-cs-11"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> European contact began in 1502â€“04 when [Christopher Columbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") sailed along the [Gulf of Honduras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Honduras "Gulf of Honduras").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> European exploration was begun by English settlers in 1638. [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") and [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain") both laid claim to the land until Britain defeated the Spanish in the [Battle of St. George's Caye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_St._George%27s_Caye "Battle of St. George's Caye") (1798).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> It became [a British colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Honduras "British Honduras") in 1840, and a [Crown colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown colony") in 1862.

Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine plants and animals and its diversity of ecosystems, including extensive [coral reefs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef"), give it a key place in the globally significant [Mesoamerican Biological Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Biological_Corridor "Mesoamerican Biological Corridor").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> It is considered a [Central American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America") and [Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean") nation with strong ties to both the American and Caribbean regions.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
