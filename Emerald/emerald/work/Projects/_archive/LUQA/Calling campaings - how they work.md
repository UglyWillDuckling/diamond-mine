# Entities

## **Calling Campaign**

A campaign is a set of leads that we want to call.

It is defined by the following parameters:
* the [[Sale Slot entity|slot]] of the campaign: only leads scheduled to be called in this slot will be selected.
* the [[lead segments]] (**PVI** or **PVB**): only leads having this segment will be selected.
  A campaign can select lead from **multiple** segments.
  Note that **PVI** includes PVS and PVM segments too.
* the type of the lead ([[RDVVQ]], [[PQSC]] or [[direct Lead Type|Direct]]): only leads having this type will be selected
* the type of the campaign (CF, PVI, PVB or PQSC): different type of campaign have different rules
  In a PVI campaign, the leads are assigned to agents, while in PVB or PQSC campaign they are not.
  The type of campaign also define the available slots and the max number of leads that can be injected in a campaign.
* an agents group: only leads done in the group zone will be selected.
