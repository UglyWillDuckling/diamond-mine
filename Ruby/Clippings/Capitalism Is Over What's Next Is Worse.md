The Silicon Valley Plan to End Capitalism  
  
While the billionaires of Silicon Valley might seem like they're pushing capitalism into a brave new world, they're actually trying to move beyond it all together. It's called technofeudalism, and it imagines a world in which powerful corporations and oligarchs replace governments.
