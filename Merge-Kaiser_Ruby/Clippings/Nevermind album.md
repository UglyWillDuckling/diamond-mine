***Nevermind*** is the second studio album by the American rock band [Nirvana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_\(band\) "Nirvana (band)"), released on September 24, 1991, by [DGC Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGC_Records "DGC Records"). It was Nirvana's first release on a [major label](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label#Major_versus_independent_record_labels "Record label") and the first to feature drummer [Dave Grohl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl "Dave Grohl"). Produced by [Butch Vig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Vig "Butch Vig"), *Nevermind* features a more polished, radio-friendly sound than the band's prior work.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It was recorded at [Sound City Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_City_Studios "Sound City Studios") in [Van Nuys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Nuys "Van Nuys"), California, and [Smart Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Studios "Smart Studios") in [Madison, Wisconsin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin "Madison, Wisconsin"), in May and June 1991, and [mastered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mastering "Audio mastering") that August at the Mastering Lab in [Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles "Hollywood, Los Angeles"), California.

Written primarily by frontman [Kurt Cobain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain "Kurt Cobain"), *Nevermind* is noted for channeling a range of emotions, being noted as dark, humorous, and disturbing. Its themes include [anti-establishment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment "Anti-establishment") and anti-sexism views, [frustration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration "Frustration"), alienation, and troubled love inspired by Cobain's broken relationship with [Bikini Kill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Kill "Bikini Kill") 's [Tobi Vail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobi_Vail "Tobi Vail"). Contrary to the popular [hedonistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism "Hedonism") themes of drugs and sex at the time, writers have observed that *Nevermind* promoted the image of the sensitive artist in mainstream rock.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Goodman-2016-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> According to Cobain, the sound of the album was influenced by bands such as [Pixies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_\(band\) "Pixies (band)"), [R.E.M.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M. "R.E.M."), [the Smithereens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smithereens "The Smithereens"), and [Melvins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvins "Melvins"). Though the album is considered a cornerstone of the [grunge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge "Grunge") genre, it is noted for its [musical diversity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclecticism_in_music "Eclecticism in music"), which includes acoustic ballads (" [Polly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_\(Nirvana_song\) "Polly (Nirvana song)") " and " [Something in the Way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_in_the_Way "Something in the Way") ") and [punk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock "Punk rock") -influenced [hard rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock "Hard rock") ("Territorial Pissings" and "Stay Away").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>

*Nevermind* became an unexpected critical and commercial success, reaching the top 10 on charts across the world. On January 11, 1992, it replaced [Michael Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson "Michael Jackson") 's *[Dangerous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_\(Michael_Jackson_album\) "Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)")* on the number one spot of the US [*Billboard* 200](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Billboard_200 "US Billboard 200") and was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. The lead single, " [Smells Like Teen Spirit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit "Smells Like Teen Spirit") ", reached the Top 10 of the US [*Billboard* Hot 100](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 "Billboard Hot 100") and went on to be inducted into the [Grammy Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame "Grammy Hall of Fame").

The album was voted the best album of the year in [Pazz & Jop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazz_%26_Jop "Pazz & Jop") critics' poll, while "Smells Like Teen Spirit" also topped the single-of-the-year and video-of-the-year polls. The album also garnered the band three [Grammy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards "Grammy Awards") nominations in total across the [34th](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Annual_Grammy_Awards "34th Annual Grammy Awards") and [35th Grammy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/35th_Annual_Grammy_Awards "35th Annual Grammy Awards"), including [Best Alternative Music Album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Alternative_Music_Album "Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album").

*Nevermind* propelled Nirvana into worldwide superstardom, with Cobain being dubbed the "voice of his generation". It brought grunge and [alternative rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock#Popularization_in_the_1990s "Alternative rock") to a mainstream audience while accelerating the decline of [hair metal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_metal "Hair metal"), drawing similarities to the early 1960s [British Invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Invasion "British Invasion") of [American popular music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_popular_music "American popular music"). It is also often credited with initiating a resurgence of interest in [punk culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_culture "Punk culture") among teenagers and young adults of [Generation X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X "Generation X"). It has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [best-selling albums of all time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums "List of best-selling albums").

Among the most acclaimed and influential albums in the history of music, *Nevermind* was added by the [Library of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") to the [National Recording Registry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recording_Registry "National Recording Registry") in 2004 for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant", and is frequently ranked highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time, including being ranked number six on *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* ' s 2020 and 2023 lists of the " [500 Greatest Albums of All Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time "Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time") ". The album has since been reissued with alternate takes and live performances.
