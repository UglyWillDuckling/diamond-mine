 **A Git treasure!**

  The  .git/info/exclude  file is a special file in a Git repository that
  allows you to specify patterns to ignore, similar to a  .gitignore  file.
  However, unlike  .gitignore , which is committed to the repository and
  applies to all users,  .git/info/exclude  is specific to the local
  repository and is not committed.

  Here are some key aspects of  .git/info/exclude :

  Purpose: This file specifies patterns to ignore, just like  .gitignore .
  However, since it's local, you can use it to ignore files or patterns that
  are specific to your development environment or workflow, without affecting
  others who clone the repository.

  Location: The file is located in the  .git/info  directory, which is a
  hidden directory within the Git repository.

  Format: The format is the same as  .gitignore , with each pattern on a
  separate line. You can use glob patterns, negations, and comments, just like
  in  .gitignore .

  Scope: The patterns specified in  .git/info/exclude  only apply to the local
  repository, and are not committed to the Git repository.

  Overriding: If a pattern is specified in both  .gitignore  and
  .git/info/exclude , the pattern in  .git/info/exclude  takes precedence.

  Use cases:

  • Ignore temporary files or directories generated by your development tools
  or IDE.
  • Exclude files that are specific to your local machine or environment, such
  as configuration files or cache directories.
  • Temporarily ignore files or patterns while working on a feature or bug
  fix, without affecting the global  .gitignore  file.

  Remember that  .git/info/exclude  is a local file, so it won't be shared
  with others who clone the repository. If you want to share ignored patterns
  with others, use the  .gitignore  file instead.
