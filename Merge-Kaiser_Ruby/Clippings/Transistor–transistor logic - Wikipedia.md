**Transistor–transistor logic** (**TTL**) is a [logic family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_family "Logic family") built from [bipolar junction transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") (BJTs). Its name signifies that transistors perform both the logic function (the first "transistor") and the amplifying function (the second "transistor"), as opposed to earlier [resistor–transistor logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic "Resistor–transistor logic") (RTL) and [diode–transistor logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode%E2%80%93transistor_logic "Diode–transistor logic") (DTL).

TTL [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") (ICs) were widely used in applications such as [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, consumer electronics, and [synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer "Synthesizer").[^1]

After their introduction in integrated circuit form in 1963 by [Sylvania Electric Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvania_Electric_Products "Sylvania Electric Products"), TTL integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies. The [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series "7400 series") by [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments") became particularly popular. TTL manufacturers offered a wide range of [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate"), [flip-flops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_\(electronics\) "Flip-flop (electronics)"), counters, and other circuits. Variations of the original TTL circuit design offered higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization. TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic [dual in-line package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package "Dual in-line package") (s) and in flat-pack form. Some TTL chips are now also made in [surface-mount technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology "Surface-mount technology") packages.

TTL became the foundation of computers and other digital electronics. Even after [Very-Large-Scale Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-Large-Scale_Integration "Very-Large-Scale Integration") (VLSI) [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") integrated circuit [microprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor") made multiple-chip processors obsolete, TTL devices still found extensive use as [glue logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_logic "Glue logic") interfacing between more densely integrated components.

## History

![[~/×/cfe0d5de69d8871a8608efd17f0d85b4_MD5.jpg|200]]
*A real-time clock built of TTL chips around 1979*

TTL was invented in **1961** by [James L. Buie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Buie "James L. Buie") of [TRW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRW_Inc. "TRW Inc."), which declared it "particularly suited to the newly developing integrated circuit design technology." The original name for TTL was *transistor-coupled transistor logic* (TCTL).[^2] The first commercial integrated-circuit TTL devices were manufactured by Sylvania in 1963, called the Sylvania Universal High-Level Logic family (SUHL).[^3] The Sylvania parts were used in the controls of the [Phoenix missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_missile "Phoenix missile").[^3] TTL became popular with electronic systems designers after [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments") introduced the 5400 series of ICs, with military temperature range, in 1964 and the later [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series "7400 series"), specified over a narrower range and with inexpensive plastic packages, in 1966.[^4]

The Texas Instruments 7400 family became an industry standard. Compatible parts were made by [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola "Motorola"), [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD "AMD"), [Fairchild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor "Fairchild Semiconductor"), [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel"), [Intersil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersil "Intersil"), [Signetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signetics "Signetics"), [Mullard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullard "Mullard"), [Siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens "Siemens"), [SGS-Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGS-Thomson "SGS-Thomson"), [Rifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIFA_\(manufacturer\) "RIFA (manufacturer)"), [National Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Semiconductor "National Semiconductor"),[^5] [^6] and many other companies, even in the Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union, GDR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania — for details see [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series#Second_sources_from_Europe_and_Eastern_Bloc "7400 series")). Not only did others make compatible TTL parts, but compatible parts were made using many other circuit technologies as well. At least one manufacturer, [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM"), produced non-compatible TTL circuits for its own use; IBM used the technology in the [IBM System/38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/38 "IBM System/38"), [IBM 4300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_4300 "IBM 4300"), and [IBM 3081](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3081 "IBM 3081").[^7]

The term "TTL" is applied to many successive generations of [bipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BJT "BJT") logic, with gradual improvements in speed and power consumption over about two decades. The most recently introduced family 74Fxx is still sold today (as of 2019), and was widely used into the late 90s. 74AS/ALS Advanced Schottky was introduced in 1985.[^8] As of 2008, Texas Instruments continues to supply the more general-purpose chips in numerous obsolete technology families, albeit at increased prices. Typically, TTL chips integrate no more than a few hundred transistors each. Functions within a single package generally range from a few [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate") to a microprocessor [bit-slice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-slice "Bit-slice"). TTL also became important because its low cost made digital techniques economically practical for tasks previously done by analog methods.[^9]

The [Kenbak-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenbak-1 "Kenbak-1"), ancestor of the first [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), used TTL for its [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") instead of a [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor") chip, which was not available in 1971.[^10] The [Datapoint 2200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint_2200 "Datapoint 2200") from 1970 used TTL components for its CPU and was the basis for the [8008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8008 "Intel 8008") and later the [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 "X86") instruction set.[^11] The 1973 [Xerox Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto "Xerox Alto") and 1981 [Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star "Xerox Star") workstations, which introduced the [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface"), used TTL circuits integrated at the level of [arithmetic logic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit "Arithmetic logic unit") (ALUs) and bitslices, respectively. Most computers used TTL-compatible " [glue logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_logic "Glue logic") " between larger chips well into the 1990s. Until the advent of [programmable logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_device "Programmable logic device"), discrete bipolar logic was used to prototype and [emulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_emulation "Hardware emulation") [microarchitectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture "Microarchitecture") under development.

## Implementation

![[~/×/55c990881cc19e6b9037707967f07a44_MD5.png]]

Two-input TTL NAND gate with a simple output stage (simplified)

TTL inputs are the emitters of bipolar transistors. In the case of NAND inputs, the inputs are the emitters of [multiple-emitter transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-emitter_transistor "Multiple-emitter transistor"), functionally equivalent to multiple transistors where the bases and collectors are tied together.[^12] The transistor's collector is buffered by a [common emitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_emitter "Common emitter") amplifier.

**Inputs both logical ones.** When all the inputs are held at high voltage, the base–emitter junctions of the multiple-emitter transistor are reverse-biased. Unlike DTL, a small collector current (approximately 10 μA) is drawn by each of the inputs. This is because the transistor is in [reverse-active mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor#Regions_of_operation "Bipolar junction transistor"). An approximately constant current flows from the positive rail, through the resistor and into the base of the multiple emitter transistor.[^13] This current passes through the base–emitter junction of the output transistor, allowing it to conduct and pulling the output voltage low (logical zero).

**An input logical zero.** Note that the base–collector junction of the multiple-emitter transistor and the base–emitter junction of the output transistor are in series between the bottom of the resistor and ground. If one input voltage becomes zero, the corresponding base–emitter junction of the multiple-emitter transistor is in parallel with these two junctions. A phenomenon called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected in parallel, the current flows through the path with the smaller threshold voltage. That is, current flows out of this input and into the zero (low) voltage source. As a result, no current flows through the base of the output transistor, causing it to stop conducting and the output voltage becomes high (logical one). During the transition the input transistor is briefly in its active region; so it draws a large current away from the base of the output transistor and thus quickly discharges its base. This is a critical advantage of TTL over DTL that speeds up the transition over a diode input structure.[^14]

The main disadvantage of TTL with a simple output stage is the relatively high output resistance at output [logical "1"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_level "Logic level") that is completely determined by the output collector resistor. It limits the number of inputs that can be connected (the [fanout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanout "Fanout")). Some advantage of the simple output stage is the high voltage level (up to V <sub>CC</sub>) of the output logical "1" when the output is not loaded.

A common variation omits the collector resistor of the output transistor, making an [open-collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-collector "Open-collector") output. This allows the designer to fabricate [wired logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_logic_connection "Wired logic connection") by connecting the open-collector outputs of several logic gates together and providing a single external [pull-up resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor "Pull-up resistor"). If any of the logic gates becomes logic low (transistor conducting), the combined output will be low. Examples of this type of gate are the 7401 [^15] and 7403 [^16] series. Open-collector outputs of some gates have a higher maximum voltage, such as 15 V for the 7426,[^17] useful when driving non-TTL loads.

Standard TTL NAND with a "totem-pole" output stage, one of four in 7400

To solve the problem with the high output resistance of the simple output stage the second schematic adds to this a "totem-pole" (" [push–pull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_output "Push–pull output") ") output. It consists of the two n-p-n transistors V <sub>3</sub> and V <sub>4</sub>, the "lifting" diode V <sub>5</sub> and the current-limiting resistor R <sub>3</sub> (see the figure on the right). It is driven by applying the same *current steering* idea as above.

When V <sub>2</sub> is "off", V <sub>4</sub> is "off" as well and V <sub>3</sub> operates in active region as a [voltage follower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_collector "Common collector") producing high output voltage (logical "1").

When V <sub>2</sub> is "on", it activates V <sub>4</sub>, driving low voltage (logical "0") to the output. Again there is a current-steering effect: the series combination of V <sub>2</sub> 's C-E junction and V <sub>4</sub> 's B-E junction is in parallel with the series of V <sub>3</sub> B-E, V <sub>5</sub> 's anode-cathode junction, and V <sub>4</sub> C-E. The second series combination has the higher threshold voltage, so no current flows through it, i.e. V <sub>3</sub> base current is deprived. Transistor V <sub>3</sub> turns "off" and it does not impact on the output.

In the middle of the transition, the resistor R <sub>3</sub> limits the current flowing directly through the series connected transistor V <sub>3</sub>, diode V <sub>5</sub> and transistor V <sub>4</sub> that are all conducting. It also limits the output current in the case of output logical "1" and short connection to the ground. The strength of the gate may be increased without proportionally affecting the power consumption by removing the pull-up and pull-down resistors from the output stage.[^18] [^19]

The main advantage of TTL with a "totem-pole" output stage is the low output resistance at output logical "1". It is determined by the upper output transistor V <sub>3</sub> operating in active region as an [emitter follower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emitter_follower "Emitter follower"). The resistor R <sub>3</sub> does not increase the output resistance since it is connected in the V <sub>3</sub> collector and its influence is compensated by the negative feedback.

A disadvantage of the "totem-pole" output stage is the decreased voltage level (no more than 3.5 V) of the output logical "1" (even if the output is unloaded). The reasons for this reduction are the voltage drops across the V <sub>3</sub> base–emitter and V <sub>5</sub> anode–cathode junctions.

## Interfacing considerations

Like DTL, TTL is a *current-sinking logic* since a current must be drawn from inputs to bring them to a logic 0 voltage level. The driving stage must absorb up to 1.6 mA from a standard TTL input while not allowing the voltage to rise to more than 0.4 volts.[^20] The output stage of the most common TTL gates is specified to function correctly when driving up to 10 standard input stages (a fanout of 10). TTL inputs are sometimes simply left floating to provide a logical "1", though this usage is not recommended.[^21]

Standard TTL circuits operate with a 5- [volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt") power supply. A TTL input signal is defined as "low" when between 0 V and 0.8 V with respect to the ground terminal, and "high" when between 2 V and V <sub>CC</sub> (5 V),[^22] [^23] and if a voltage signal ranging between 0.8 V and 2.0 V is sent into the input of a TTL gate, there is no certain response from the gate and therefore it is considered "uncertain" (precise logic levels vary slightly between sub-types and by temperature). TTL outputs are typically restricted to narrower limits of between 0.0 V and 0.4 V for a "low" and between 2.4 V and V <sub>CC</sub> for a "high", providing at least 0.4 V of [noise immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_\(electronics\) "Noise (electronics)"). Standardization of the TTL levels is so ubiquitous that complex circuit boards often contain TTL chips made by many different manufacturers selected for availability and cost, compatibility being assured. Two circuit board units off the same assembly line on different successive days or weeks might have a different mix of brands of chips in the same positions on the board; repair is possible with chips manufactured years later than original components. Within usefully broad limits, logic gates can be treated as ideal Boolean devices without concern for electrical limitations. The 0.4 V noise margins are adequate because of the low output impedance of the driver stage, that is, a large amount of noise power superimposed on the output is needed to drive an input into an undefined region.

In some cases (e.g., when the output of a TTL logic gate needs to be used for driving the input of a CMOS gate), the voltage level of the "totem-pole" output stage at output logical "1" can be increased closer to V <sub>CC</sub> by connecting an external resistor between the V4 collector and the positive rail. It [pulls up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor "Pull-up resistor") the V <sub>5</sub> cathode and cuts-off the diode.[^24] However, this technique actually converts the sophisticated "totem-pole" output into a simple output stage having significant output resistance when driving a high level (determined by the external resistor).

## Packaging

Like most integrated circuits of the period 1963–1990, commercial TTL devices are usually packaged in [dual in-line packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package "Dual in-line package") (DIPs), usually with 14 to 24 pins,[^25] for [through-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole "Through-hole") or socket mounting. Epoxy plastic (PDIP) packages were often used for commercial temperature range components, while ceramic packages (CDIP) were used for military temperature range parts.

[Beam-lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_lead_technology "Beam lead technology") chip dies without packages were made for assembly into larger arrays as hybrid integrated circuits. Parts for military and aerospace applications were packaged in [flatpacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpack_\(electronics\) "Flatpack (electronics)"), a form of surface-mount package, with leads suitable for welding or soldering to printed circuit boards. Today, many TTL-compatible devices are available in surface-mount packages, which are available in a wider array of types than through-hole packages.

TTL is particularly well suited to bipolar integrated circuits because additional inputs to a gate merely required additional emitters on a shared base region of the input transistor. If individually packaged transistors were used, the cost of all the transistors would discourage one from using such an input structure. But in an integrated circuit, the additional emitters for extra gate inputs add only a small area.

At least one computer manufacturer, IBM, built its own [flip chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_chip "Flip chip") integrated circuits with TTL; these chips were mounted on ceramic multi-chip modules.[^26] [^27]

TTL devices consume substantially more power than equivalent [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") devices at rest, but power consumption does not increase with clock speed as rapidly as for CMOS devices.[^28] Compared to contemporary [ECL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emitter_coupled_logic "Emitter coupled logic") circuits, TTL uses less power and has easier design rules but is substantially slower. Designers can combine ECL and TTL devices in the same system to achieve best overall performance and economy, but level-shifting devices are required between the two logic families. TTL is less sensitive to damage from [electrostatic discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge "Electrostatic discharge") than early CMOS devices.

Due to the output structure of TTL devices, the output impedance is asymmetrical between the high and low state, making them unsuitable for driving transmission lines. This drawback is usually overcome by buffering the outputs with special line-driver devices where signals need to be sent through cables. ECL, by virtue of its symmetric low-impedance output structure, does not have this drawback.

The TTL "totem-pole" output structure often has a momentary overlap when both the upper and lower transistors are conducting, resulting in a substantial pulse of current drawn from the power supply. These pulses can couple in unexpected ways between multiple integrated circuit packages, resulting in reduced noise margin and lower performance. TTL systems usually have a [decoupling capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor "Decoupling capacitor") for every one or two IC packages, so that a current pulse from one TTL chip does not momentarily reduce the supply voltage to another.

Since the mid 1980s, several manufacturers supply CMOS logic equivalents with TTL-compatible input and output levels, usually bearing part numbers similar to the equivalent TTL component and with the same [pinouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinouts "Pinouts"). For example, the 74HCT00 series provides many drop-in replacements for bipolar [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series "7400 series") parts, but uses [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") technology. (The "T" in "HCT" stands for "TTL-compatible". The related 74HC00 series also uses CMOS technology but is not TTL-compatible.)

## Sub-types

Successive generations of technology produced compatible parts with improved power consumption or switching speed, or both. Although vendors uniformly marketed these various product lines as TTL with [Schottky diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode "Schottky diode"), some of the underlying circuits, such as used in the LS family, could rather be considered [DTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTL "DTL").[^29]

Variations of and successors to the basic TTL family, which has a typical gate propagation delay of 10ns and a power dissipation of 10 mW per gate, for a [power–delay product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power%E2%80%93delay_product "Power–delay product") (PDP) or [switching energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_energy "Switching energy") of about 100 [pJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule"), include:

- Low-power TTL (L), which traded switching speed (33ns) for a reduction in power consumption (1 mW) (now essentially replaced by [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") logic)
- High-speed TTL (H), with faster switching than standard TTL (6ns) but significantly higher power dissipation (22 mW)
- Schottky TTL (S), introduced in 1969, which used [Schottky diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode "Schottky diode") clamps at gate inputs to prevent charge storage and improve switching time. These gates operated more quickly (3ns) but had higher power dissipation (19 mW)
- Low-power Schottky TTL (LS) – used the higher resistance values of low-power TTL and the Schottky diodes to provide a good combination of speed (9.5 ns) and reduced power consumption (2 mW), and PDP of about 20 pJ. Probably the most common type of TTL, these were used as glue logic in microcomputers, essentially replacing the former H, L, and S sub-families.
- Fast (F) and Advanced-Schottky (AS) variants of LS from Fairchild and TI, respectively, circa 1985, with " [Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_effect "Miller effect") -killer" circuits to speed up the low-to-high transition. These families achieved PDPs of 10 pJ and 4 pJ, respectively, the lowest of all the TTL families.
- Low-voltage TTL (LVTTL) for 3.3-volt power supplies and memory interfacing.

Most manufacturers offer commercial and extended temperature ranges: for example Texas Instruments [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series "7400 series") parts are rated from 0 to 70 °C, and 5400 series devices over the military-specification temperature range of −55 to +125 °C.

Special quality levels and high-reliability parts are available for military and aerospace applications.

[Radiation-hardened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-hardened "Radiation-hardened") devices (for example from the SNJ54 series) are offered for space applications.

## Applications

Before the advent of [VLSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-large-scale_integration "Very-large-scale integration") devices, TTL integrated circuits were a standard method of construction for the processors of [minicomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer "Minicomputer") and midrange [mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer "Mainframe computer") computers, such as the [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX "VAX") and [Data General Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General_Eclipse "Data General Eclipse"); however some computer families were based on proprietary components (e.g. Fairchild CTL) while supercomputers and high-end mainframes used [emitter-coupled logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emitter-coupled_logic "Emitter-coupled logic"). They were also used for equipment such as machine tool numerical controls, printers and video display terminals, and as [microprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor") became more functional for "glue logic" applications, such as address decoders and bus drivers, which tie together the function blocks realized in VLSI elements. The [Gigatron TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigatron_TTL "Gigatron TTL") is a more recent (2018) example of a processor built entirely with TTL integrated circuits.

### Analog applications

While originally designed to handle logic-level digital signals, a TTL inverter can be biased as an analog amplifier. Connecting a resistor between the output and the input biases the TTL element as a [negative feedback amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback_amplifier "Negative feedback amplifier"). Such amplifiers may be useful to convert analog signals to the digital domain but would not ordinarily be used where analog amplification is the primary purpose.[^30] TTL inverters can also be used in [crystal oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator "Crystal oscillator") where their analog amplification ability is significant.

A TTL gate may operate inadvertently as an analog amplifier if the input is connected to a slowly changing input signal that traverses the unspecified region from 0.8 V to 2 V. The output can be erratic when the input is in this range. A slowly changing input like this can also cause excess power dissipation in the output circuit. If such an analog input must be used, there are specialized TTL parts with [Schmitt trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger "Schmitt trigger") inputs available that will reliably convert the analog input to a digital value, effectively operating as a one bit A to D converter.

### Serial signaling

**TTL serial** refers to [single-ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-ended_signaling "Single-ended signaling") [serial communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication "Serial communication") using raw transistor voltage levels: "low" for 0 and "high" for 1.[^31] [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter "Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter") over TTL serial is a common debug interface for embedded devices. Handheld devices such as graphing calculators and [NMEA 0183](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 "NMEA 0183") -compliant [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") receivers and [fishfinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishfinder "Fishfinder") also commonly use UART with TTL. TTL serial is only a *de facto* standard: there are no strict electrical guidelines. Driver–receiver modules interface between TTL and longer-range serial standards: one example is the [MAX232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX232 "MAX232"), which converts from and to [RS-232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232 "RS-232").[^32]

[Differential TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_TTL "Differential TTL") is TTL serial carried over a [differential pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signalling "Differential signalling") with complement levels, providing much enhanced noise tolerance. Both [RS-422](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-422 "RS-422") and [RS-485](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485 "RS-485") signals can be produced using TTL levels.[^33]

[ccTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CcTalk "CcTalk") is based on TTL voltage levels.
