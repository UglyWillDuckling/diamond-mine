**Gansu**[^1] is a [province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_China "Provinces of China") in [Northwestern China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_China "Northwestern China"). Its capital and largest city is [Lanzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou "Lanzhou"), in the southeastern part of the province. The seventh-largest administrative district by area at 453,700 square kilometres (175,200 sq mi), Gansu lies between the [Tibetan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau "Tibetan Plateau") and [Loess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loess_Plateau "Loess Plateau") plateaus and borders [Mongolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia "Mongolia")'s [Govi-Altai Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govi-Altai_Province "Govi-Altai Province"), [Inner Mongolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia "Inner Mongolia") and [Ningxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia "Ningxia") to the north, [Xinjiang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang") and [Qinghai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinghai "Qinghai") to the west, [Sichuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan") to the south and [Shaanxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi") to the east. The [Yellow River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River") passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu's territory is located in the [Gobi Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi_Desert "Gobi Desert"). The [Qilian mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilian_Mountains "Qilian Mountains") are located in the south of the Province.

Gansu has a population of 26 million, ranking [22nd in China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_population "List of Chinese administrative divisions by population"). Its population is mostly [Han](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese"), along with [Hui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people "Hui people"), [Dongxiang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongxiangs "Dongxiangs") and [Tibetan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people "Tibetan people") minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [ranking last](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_provincial-level_divisions_by_GDP_per_capita "List of Chinese provincial-level divisions by GDP per capita") in GDP per capita as of 2019.

The [state of Qin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Qin "State of Qin") originated in what is now southeastern Gansu, and later established the first imperial dynasty in Chinese history. The [Northern Silk Road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Silk_Road "Northern Silk Road") ran through the [Hexi Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexi_Corridor "Hexi Corridor"), which passes through Gansu, resulting in it being an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire.

The city of [Jiayuguan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiayuguan_City "Jiayuguan City"), the second most populated city in Gansu, is known for its section of the [Great Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China") and the [Jiayu Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiayu_Pass "Jiayu Pass") fortress complex.

## Name

Gansu is a compound of the names of [Ganzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzhou,_Zhangye "Ganzhou, Zhangye") (now the main [urban district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_\(PRC\) "District (PRC)") and [seat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_seat "Administrative seat") of [Zhangye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangye "Zhangye")) and [Suzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou,_Jiuquan "Suzhou, Jiuquan") (an old name and the modern seat of [Jiuquan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiuquan "Jiuquan")), formerly the two most important Chinese settlements in the [Hexi Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexi_Corridor "Hexi Corridor").

Gansu is abbreviated as 甘 (*Gān*) or 陇 (*Lǒng*), and was also known as [Longxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longxi_Commandery "Longxi Commandery") (陇西; 'west of Long') or Longyou (陇右; 'right of Long') prior to early [Western Han dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Han_dynasty "Western Han dynasty"), in reference to [Mount Liupan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Liupan "Mount Liupan") between eastern Gansu and western [Shaanxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi").

Until 1987, Gansu was rendered in the [postal romanization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_postal_romanization "Chinese postal romanization") and [Wade-Giles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade-Giles "Wade-Giles") as **Kansu**, which was gradually replaced by pinyin starting in 1958.[^10] The spelling of the province is also spelled in [Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Phonetic_Symbols_II "Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II") (1986) and [Tongyong Pinyin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongyong_Pinyin "Tongyong Pinyin") (2002) adopted by [Taiwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan"), who would later adopt Hanyu Pinyin in 2009.

## History

The ruins of a [Han dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") (202 BC – 220 AD) Chinese [watchtower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchtower "Watchtower") made of [rammed earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth "Rammed earth") at [Dunhuang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunhuang "Dunhuang"), Gansu province, the eastern edge of the [Silk Road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road")

Gansu's name is a [compound name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_\(linguistics\) "Compound (linguistics)") first used during the [Song dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty"). It is a combination of the names of two prefectures (州) in the [Sui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_dynasty "Sui dynasty") and [Tang dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty"): Gan (around [Zhangye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangye "Zhangye")) and Su (around [Jiuquan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiuquan "Jiuquan")). Its eastern part forms part of one of the cradles of ancient Chinese civilisation.

### Ancient Gansu

In prehistoric times, Gansu was host to [Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") cultures. The [Dadiwan culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadiwan_culture "Dadiwan culture"), from where archaeologically significant [artifacts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_\(archaeology\) "Artifact (archaeology)") have been excavated, flourished in the eastern end of Gansu from about 6000BC to about 3000BC.[^11] The [Majiayao culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majiayao_culture "Majiayao culture") and part of the [Qijia culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qijia_culture "Qijia culture") took root in Gansu from 3100 BC to 2700 BC and 2400 BC to 1900 BC respectively.

The [Yuezhi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuezhi "Yuezhi") originally lived in the very western part of Gansu until they were forced to emigrate by the [Xiongnu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu "Xiongnu") around 177 BC.

The [State of Qin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_\(state\) "Qin (state)"), known in China as the [founding state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_dynasty "Qin dynasty") of the [Chinese empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Imperial_China "Early Imperial China"), grew out from the southeastern part of Gansu, specifically the [Tianshui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianshui "Tianshui") area. The Qin name is believed to have originated, in part, from the area.[^12][^13] Qin tombs and artifacts have been excavated from [Fangmatan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangmatan "Fangmatan") near Tianshui, including one 2200-year-old map of [Guixian County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guixian_County "Guixian County").[^14]

### Imperial era

[Xindian culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xindian_culture "Xindian culture") era jar with two lug handles uncovered in Gansu, dating to around 1,000 BC

The ruins of a gate at [Yumen Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumen_Pass "Yumen Pass"), built during the [Jin dynasty (266–420)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_\(266%E2%80%93420\) "Jin dynasty (266–420)")

In imperial times, Gansu was an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire, as the [Hexi Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexi_Corridor "Hexi Corridor") runs along the "neck" of the province. The [Han dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") extended the [Great Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China "History of the Great Wall of China") across this corridor, building the strategic [Yumenguan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumenguan "Yumenguan") (Jade Gate Pass, near [Dunhuang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunhuang "Dunhuang")) and [Yangguan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangguan "Yangguan") fort towns along it. Remains of the wall and the towns can be found there. The [Ming dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") built the [Jiayuguan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiayuguan_\(pass\) "Jiayuguan (pass)") outpost in Gansu. To the west of Yumenguan and the [Qilian Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilian_Mountains "Qilian Mountains"), at the northwestern end of the province, the [Yuezhi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuezhi "Yuezhi"), [Wusun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wusun "Wusun"), and other [nomadic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad "Nomad") tribes dwelt ([Shiji](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiji "Shiji") 123), occasionally figuring in regional imperial Chinese [geopolitics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics "Geopolitics").

By the Qingshui treaty, concluded in 823 between the [Tibetan Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Empire "Tibetan Empire") and the Tang dynasty, China lost much of western Gansu province for a significant period.[^15]

After the fall of the [Uyghur Khaganate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Khaganate "Uyghur Khaganate"), a Buddhist [Yugur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugur_people "Yugur people") (Uyghur) state called the [Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzhou_Uyghur_Kingdom "Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom") was established by migrating Uyghurs from the khaganate in part of Gansu that lasted from 848 to 1036AD.

Along the [Silk Road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road"), Gansu was an economically important province, as well as a cultural transmission path. Temples and [Buddhist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist")[grottoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotto "Grotto")[^16] such as those at [Mogao Caves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogao_Caves "Mogao Caves") ('Caves of the Thousand Buddhas') and [Maijishan Caves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maijishan_Caves "Maijishan Caves") contain artistically and historically revealing [murals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural "Mural").[^17] An early form of paper inscribed with [Chinese characters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_writing "Chinese writing") and dating to about 8BC was discovered at the site of a Western Han [garrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison "Garrison") near the Yumen pass in August 2006.[^18]

The Xixia or [Western Xia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Xia "Western Xia") dynasty controlled much of Gansu as well as [Ningxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia "Ningxia").

The province was also the origin of the [Dungan Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_Revolt_\(1862%E2%80%9377\) "Dungan Revolt (1862–77)") of 1862–77. Among the [Qing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") forces were Muslim generals, including [Ma Zhan'ao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Zhan%27ao "Ma Zhan'ao") and [Ma Anliang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Anliang "Ma Anliang"), who helped the Qing crush the rebel Muslims. The revolt had spread into Gansu from neighbouring Qinghai.

There was another [Dungan revolt from 1895 to 1896](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_revolt_\(1895%E2%80%931896\) "Dungan revolt (1895–1896)").

### Republican China

As a result of frequent earthquakes, droughts and famines, the economic progress of Gansu was significantly slower than that of other provinces of China until recently. Based on the area's abundant mineral resources it has begun developing into a vital industrial center. An [earthquake in Gansu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Haiyuan_earthquake "1920 Haiyuan earthquake") at 8.6 on the [Richter scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale "Richter magnitude scale") killed around 180,000 people mostly in the present-day area of [Ningxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia "Ningxia") in 1920, and [another with a magnitude of 7.6](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Changma_earthquake "1932 Changma earthquake") killed 275 in 1932.[^19]

The [Muslim Conflict in Gansu (1927–1930)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Conflict_in_Gansu_\(1927%E2%80%931930\) "Muslim Conflict in Gansu (1927–1930)") was a conflict against the [Guominjun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guominjun "Guominjun").

While the Muslim General [Ma Hongbin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Hongbin "Ma Hongbin") was acting chairman of the province, Muslim General [Ma Buqing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Buqing "Ma Buqing") was in virtual control of Gansu in 1940. Liangzhou District in [Wuwei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuwei,_Gansu "Wuwei, Gansu") was previously his headquarters in Gansu, where he controlled 15 million Muslims.[^20][Xinjiang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang") came under [Kuomintang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") (Nationalist) control after their soldiers entered via Gansu.[^21] Gansu's [Tienshui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianshui "Tianshui") was the site of a Japanese-Chinese warplane fight.[^22]

Gansu was vulnerable to Soviet penetration via Xinjiang.[^23] Gansu was a passageway for [Soviet war supplies for the Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Non-Aggression_Pact "Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact") during the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War").[^24] Lanzhou was a destination point via a road coming from [Dihua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihua "Dihua") (Ürümqi).[^25] The [Gonxingdun Aerodrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongxingdun_Airport "Gongxingdun Airport") was one of several air bases where the [Chinese Air Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Chinese_Nationalist_air_force_\(1937%E2%80%931945\) "Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)") operated in defense of Gansu. Gansu provided wartime China with most of the locally [sourced petrol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry "Petroleum industry") from the [Yumen Laojunmiao oil wells](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumen_City#Economy "Yumen City") beginning in the summer of 1939, producing 250,000 tons of [crude oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum "Petroleum") in those war years.[^26] Lanzhou and [Lhasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhasa "Lhasa") were designated to be recipients of a new railway.[^27]

The [Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950–1958)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang_Islamic_insurgency_in_China_\(1950%E2%80%931958\) "Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950–1958)") was a prolongation of the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War "Chinese Civil War") in several provinces including Gansu.

## Geography

Gansu has an area of 454,000 square kilometres (175,000 sq mi), and the vast majority of its land is more than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) above [sea level](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level"). It lies between the [Tibetan Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau "Tibetan Plateau") and the [Loess Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loess_Plateau "Loess Plateau"), bordering [Mongolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia "Mongolia") ([Govi-Altai Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govi-Altai_Province "Govi-Altai Province")) to the northwest, [Inner Mongolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia "Inner Mongolia") and [Ningxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia "Ningxia") to the north, [Shaanxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi") to the east, [Sichuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan") to the south, and [Xinjiang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang") to the west. The [Yellow River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River") passes through the southern part of the province. The province contains the [geographical centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_centre "Geographical centre") of China, marked by the Center of the Country Monument at [35°50′40.9″N 103°27′7.5″E](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Gansu&params=35_50_40.9_N_103_27_7.5_E_region:CN-62_type:landmark&title=Geographical+centre+of+China).[^28]

Part of the [Gobi Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi_Desert "Gobi Desert") is located in Gansu, as well as small parts of the [Badain Jaran Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badain_Jaran_Desert "Badain Jaran Desert") and the [Tengger Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengger_Desert "Tengger Desert").

The [Yellow River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River") gets most of its water from Gansu, flowing straight through Lanzhou. The area around Wuwei is part of [Shiyang River Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiyang_River_Basin&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shiyang River Basin (page does not exist)").[^29]

The landscape in Gansu is very mountainous in the south and flat in the north. The mountains in the south are part of the [Qilian Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilian_Mountains "Qilian Mountains"), while the far western [Altyn-Tagh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altyn-Tagh "Altyn-Tagh") contains the province's highest point, at 5,830 metres (19,130 ft).

A natural land passage known as [Hexi Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexi_Corridor "Hexi Corridor"), stretching some 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from Lanzhou to the [Jade Gate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumen_Pass "Yumen Pass"), is situated within the province. It is bound from north by the Gobi Desert and Qilian Mountains from the south.

Gansu generally has a semi-arid to arid continental climate ([Köppen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification")*BSk* or *BWk*) with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, although [diurnal temperature ranges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_range "Diurnal temperature range") are often so large that maxima remain above 0 °C (32 °F) even in winter. However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a [subarctic climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic_climate "Subarctic climate") (*Dwc*) – with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to −40 °C (−40 °F). Most of the limited precipitation is delivered in the summer months: winters are so dry that snow cover is confined to very high altitudes and the [snow line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_line "Snow line") can be as high as 5,500 metres (18,040 ft) in the southwest.

Gates of the provincial government complex in Lanzhou

The [Secretary of the CCP Gansu Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_Secretary_of_Gansu "Party Secretary of Gansu") is the highest-ranking office within Gansu Province.[^36] The [Governor of Gansu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Gansu "Governor of Gansu") is the second highest-ranking official within Gansu, behind the Secretary of the CPC Gansu Committee.[^36] The governor is responsible for all issues related to [economics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [personnel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personnel "Personnel"), political initiatives, the [environment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_policy "Environmental policy") and the [foreign affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy "Foreign policy") of the province.[^36] The Governor is appointed by the [Gansu Provincial People's Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gansu_Provincial_People%27s_Congress&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gansu Provincial People's Congress (page does not exist)"), which is the province's [legislative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative "Legislative") body.[^36]

## Economy

Despite recent growth in Gansu and the booming economy in the rest of China, Gansu is still considered to be one of the poorest provinces in China. For several years, it has [ranked as one of the provinces with lowest GDP per capita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_provincial-level_divisions_by_GDP_per_capita "List of Chinese provincial-level divisions by GDP per capita").[^37] Its nominal GDP for 2017 was about 767.7 billion yuan (US$113.70 billion) and per capita of 29,326 RMB (US$4,343). The province also has a large difference in wealth between regions and urban versus rural areas. The poorest areas are Dingxi, Longnan, Gannan and Linxia.[^38] According to analysts, the local economy failed to gather momentum while other provinces did manage to increase their economic growth.[^37]

### Agriculture

Farmland in [Linxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linxia_Hui_Autonomous_Prefecture "Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture")

Due to poor natural conditions such as aridness, Gansu is one of the Chinese provinces with smallest per capita area of arable land.[^38] Agricultural production includes [cotton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton "Cotton"), [linseed oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linseed_oil "Linseed oil"), [maize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), [melons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melons "Melons") (such as the [honeydew melon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_melon "Honeydew melon"), known locally as the [Bailan melon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailan_melon "Bailan melon")), [millet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet "Millet"), and [wheat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat"). Gansu is known as a source for wild medicinal herbs which are used in [Chinese medicine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_medicine "Chinese medicine"). However, pollution by heavy metals, such as [cadmium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_poisoning "Cadmium poisoning") in irrigation water, has resulted in the poisoning of many acres of agricultural land. The extent and nature of the heavy metal pollution is considered a state secret.[^39]

### Industry

The industrial sector in Gansu was developed after completion of the [Longhai railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longhai_railway "Longhai railway") in 1953 and blueprinted in the first [five-year plan of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China "Five-year plans of China").[^40] It was a major recipient of China's investment in industrial capacity during the [Third Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Front_\(China\) "Third Front (China)") campaign.[^41]<sup><span title="Page: 298">: 298 </span></sup> 

Until 2014, the industrial sector contributed the most to Gansu's economy.[^38] The most important industries are petrochemicals, [non-ferrous metallurgy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ferrous_metal "Non-ferrous metal"), machinery and electronics. The province is also an important base for wind and solar power.[^40] As a result of environmental protection policies, the industry sector is not growing.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-%E7%94%98%E8%82%83%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%85%A8%E5%9B%BD%E8%90%BD%E5%90%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%85%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%83%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%BF%9B%E5%8F%96-42"><span>[</span> 38 <span>]</span></a></sup> The manufacturing sector has been shrinking for several years and has low investment numbers.[^37]

In 2023, [TMSR-LF1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMSR-LF1 "TMSR-LF1"), an experimental [molten salt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor "Molten salt reactor") nuclear [breeder reactor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor "Breeder reactor"), achieved [criticality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticality_\(status\) "Criticality (status)").

As stipulated in the country's 12th Five Year Plan, the local government of Gansu hopes to grow the province's GDP by 10% annually by focusing investments on five pillar industries: renewable energy, coal, chemicals, nonferrous metals, pharmaceuticals and services.

#### Mining

See also: [Mining industry of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_industry_of_China "Mining industry of China")

A large part of Gansu's economy is based on [mining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") and the extraction of [minerals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerals "Minerals"),[^43] especially [rare earth elements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_elements "Rare earth elements"). The province has significant deposits of [antimony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony "Antimony"), [chromium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium "Chromium"), [coal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal "Coal"), [cobalt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt "Cobalt"), [copper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper"), [fluorite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorite "Fluorite"), [gypsum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsum "Gypsum"), [iridium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium "Iridium"), [iron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron"), [lead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead"), [limestone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone "Limestone"), [mercury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_\(element\) "Mercury (element)"), [mirabilite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabilite "Mirabilite"), [nickel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel"), [crude oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil "Crude oil"), [platinum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum "Platinum"), [troilite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilite "Troilite"), [tungsten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten "Tungsten"), and [zinc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc "Zinc") among others. The oil fields at Yumen and Changqing are considered significant.

Gansu has China's largest nickel deposits accounting for over 90% of China's total nickel reserves.[^40]

### Services

Since 2014, the service sector is the largest economic sector of Gansu.[^38] Tourism is a sector that is becoming of increased importance.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-%E7%94%98%E8%82%83%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%85%A8%E5%9B%BD%E8%90%BD%E5%90%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%85%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%83%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%BF%9B%E5%8F%96-42"><span>[</span> 38 <span>]</span></a></sup>

Gansu province is home to a little more than 25 million people.[^58] As of 2020, 47.7% of the population was rural, but much relocation in recent years has reduced this. Gansu is 89.4% [Han](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese")[^58] and also has [Hui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people "Hui people"), [Tibetan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people "Tibetan people"), [Dongxiang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongxiang_people "Dongxiang people"), [Tu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_\(ethnic_group\) "Tu (ethnic group)"), [Uyghurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs "Uyghurs"), [Yugur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugur "Yugur"), [Bonan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonans "Bonans"), [Mongolian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols "Mongols"), [Salar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_people "Salar people") and [Kazakh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs "Kazakhs") minorities. Gansu province's community of Chinese [Hui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people "Hui people") Muslims was bolstered by Hui Muslims resettled from [Shaanxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi") province during the [Dungan Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_Revolt_\(1862%E2%80%9377\) "Dungan Revolt (1862–77)"). Gansu is also a historical home, along with [Shaanxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi"), of the [dialect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_language "Dungan language") of the [Dungans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_people "Dungan people"), who migrated to [Central Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia"). The southwestern corner of Gansu is home to a large [ethnic Tibetan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people "Tibetan people") population. Modern Gansu is dominated by Lanzhou city and Linxia Hui prefectures, their growth hides the stark fact that much of the rest of the province is rapidly losing population.

## Languages

Most of the inhabitants of Gansu speak dialects of Northern [Mandarin Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese "Mandarin Chinese"). On the border areas of Gansu one might encounter [Tu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_language "Tu language"), [Tibetan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetic_languages "Tibetic languages"), [Mongolian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language "Mongolian language"), [Uyghur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_language "Uyghur language") and the [Kazakh language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language").

### Jiayuguan Pass of the Great Wall

Main article: [Jiayuguan Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiayuguan_Pass "Jiayuguan Pass")

Jiayuguan Pass, in Jiayuguan city, is the largest and most intact pass, or entrance, of the [Great Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China"). Jiayuguan Pass was built in the early [Ming dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty"), somewhere around the year 1372. It was built near an oasis that was then on the extreme western edge of China. Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name "The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven".

An extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates. One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration. Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect. The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need. When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances. The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request. When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.[^62]

### Mogao Grottoes

Main article: [Mogao Caves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogao_Caves "Mogao Caves")

Each temple has a large statue of a [buddha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_\(general\) "Buddha (general)") or [bodhisattva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva "Bodhisattva") and paintings of religious scenes. In 366 AD under the [Former Liang dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Liang "Former Liang"), a monk named Le Zun (Lo-tsun) came near Echoing Sand Mountain, when he had a [vision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_\(spirituality\) "Vision (spirituality)"). He started to carve the first grotto. During the [Five Dynasties period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period "Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period") they ran out of room on the cliff and could not build any more grottoes.

### Silk Road and Dunhuang City

On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous [Taklamakan Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taklamakan_Desert "Taklamakan Desert"). Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [Kashi (Kashgar)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashgar "Kashgar"), was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [Bactrian camels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactrian_camel "Bactrian camel") for [single humped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary "Dromedary") ones. After Kashi they would keep going until they reached their next destination.

Located about 5 km (3.1 mi) southwest of the city, the [Crescent Lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Lake_\(Dunhuang\) "Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)") or Yueyaquan is an oasis and popular spot for tourists seeking respite from the heat of the desert. Activities includes camel and 4x4 rides.

### Energy

Among Gansu's most important sources of energy are its water resources: the Yellow River and other inland river drainage basins. Gansu is placed ninth among China's provinces in annual hydropower potential and water discharge. Gansu produces 17.24 gigawatts of hydropower a year. Twenty-nine hydropower stations have been constructed in Gansu, capable of generating 30 gigawatts in total. Gansu has an estimated coal reserve of 8.92 billion tons and [petroleum reserve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves "Oil reserves") of 700 million tons.

There is also good potential for wind and solar power development.

With the exploration efforts of Sun Jianchu, Yan Shuang and other patriotic scholars, on August 11, 1939, the Laojunmiao oil well blew out the first oil. This moment has also become the starting point of China's petroleum industry.
