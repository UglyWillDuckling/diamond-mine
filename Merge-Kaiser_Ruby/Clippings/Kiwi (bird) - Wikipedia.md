**Kiwi** [^1] are [flightless birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless_bird "Flightless bird") [endemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism "Endemism") to [New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand") of the [order](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_\(biology\) "Order (biology)") **Apterygiformes**. The five extant species fall into the family **Apterygidae** [^2] and genus ***Apteryx***.[^3] [^9] [^10] Approximately the size of a [domestic chicken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_chicken "Domestic chicken"), kiwi are the smallest [ratites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratite "Ratite") (which also include [ostriches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich "Ostrich"), [emus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu "Emu"), [rheas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_\(bird\) "Rhea (bird)"), [cassowaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary "Cassowary") and the extinct [elephant birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_bird "Elephant bird") and [moa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa "Moa")).

DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy [elephant birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_bird "Elephant bird") than to the [moa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa "Moa") with which they shared New Zealand.[^11] There are five recognised species, four of which are currently listed as [vulnerable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species "Vulnerable species"), and [one](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_spotted_kiwi "Little spotted kiwi") of which is [near threatened](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-threatened_species "Near-threatened species"). All species have been negatively affected by historic [deforestation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_New_Zealand "Deforestation in New Zealand"), but their remaining habitat is well protected in large forest reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by [invasive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species "Invasive species") mammalian predators.

The vestigial wings are so small as to be invisible under their bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. Kiwi eggs are one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any order of bird in the world.[^12] Other unique [adaptations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation") of kiwi, such as short and stout legs and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well known.

The kiwi is recognised as an [icon of New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_New_Zealand "National symbols of New Zealand"), and the association is so strong that the term *[Kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_\(nickname\) "Kiwi (nickname)")* is used internationally as the colloquial [demonym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym "Demonym") for New Zealanders.[^13]

## Etymology

The [Māori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language") word *kiwi* is generally accepted to be "of imitative origin" from its [call](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization "Bird vocalization").[^14] Some linguists derive the word from [Proto-Nuclear Polynesian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Polynesian_language "Proto-Polynesian language") \* *kiwi*, which refers to *Numenius tahitiensis*, the [bristle-thighed curlew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristle-thighed_curlew "Bristle-thighed curlew"), a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands [^15] that kind of resembles with its long decurved bill and brown body. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the newfound bird.[^16] Some linguists like [Robert Blust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blust "Robert Blust") however propose that *kiwi* originated from [Proto-Oceanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Oceanic_language "Proto-Oceanic language") name for the [Pacific golden plover](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_golden_plover "Pacific golden plover"), \* *kiwiwi*.[^17]

The bird's name is usually spelled with a lower-case *k*. It normally stays unchanged when [pluralised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") in English, mirroring its usage in the Māori language itself. This contrasts with when kiwi is used to refer to a group of New Zealanders, which is typically pluralised as kiwis.[^18] [^19]

The genus name *Apteryx* is derived from [Ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") 'without wing': *a-* (ἀ-), 'without' or 'not'; *ptéryx* (πτέρυξ), 'wing'.[^20]

Although it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites, the [moa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa "Moa"), recent [DNA studies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics "Molecular phylogenetics") have identified its closest relative as the extinct [elephant bird](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_bird "Elephant bird") of [Madagascar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar"),[^11] [^21] and among extant ratites, the kiwi is more closely related to the [emu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu "Emu") and the [cassowaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary "Cassowary") than to the moa.[^11] [^22]

Research published in 2013 on an extinct genus, *[Proapteryx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proapteryx "Proapteryx")*, known from the [Miocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene "Miocene") deposits of the [Saint Bathans Fauna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Bathans_Fauna "Saint Bathans Fauna"), found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight, supporting the hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas, which were already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared.[^23]

### Species

There are five known extant species of kiwi, with a number of subspecies. One extinct species is also known.

Relationships in the genus *Apteryx* [^24]

| Image | Scientific name | Common name | Distribution | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | *Apteryx haastii* | [Great spotted kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_spotted_kiwi "Great spotted kiwi") or roroa | New Zealand | The largest species, standing about 45 cm (18 in) tall, with females weighing about 3.3 kg (7.3 lb) and males about 2.4 kg (5.3 lb). It has grey-brown plumage with lighter bands. The female lays one egg a year, which both parents incubate. The population is estimated at over 20,000, distributed through the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northern [West Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast,_New_Zealand "West Coast, New Zealand"), and the [Southern Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Alps "Southern Alps") of the South Island.[^25] |
|  | *Apteryx owenii* | [Little spotted kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_spotted_kiwi "Little spotted kiwi") | [Kapiti Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapiti_Island "Kapiti Island") | A small kiwi the size of a [bantam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantam_\(chicken\) "Bantam (chicken)"), standing 25 cm (9.8 in) tall, with the female weighing 1.3 kg (2.9 lb). She lays one egg, which is incubated by the male. This small, docile kiwi is unable to withstand predation by introduced pigs, [stoats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat "Stoat") and cats, leading to its extinction on the mainland. There are about 1350 on Kapiti Island and it has been introduced to other predator-free islands, where it appears to be getting established with about 50 on each island.[^26] |
|  | *Apteryx rowi* | [Okarito kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okarito_kiwi "Okarito kiwi"), rowi or Okarito brown kiwi | [South Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island "South Island") | The [Okarito kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okarito_kiwi "Okarito kiwi"), first identified as a new species in 1994,[^27] is slightly smaller than the North Island brown kiwi, with a greyish tinge to the plumage and sometimes white facial feathers. Females lay up to three eggs in a season, each one in a different nest. Male and female both incubate. Distribution is now limited to a small area on the West Coast, but studies of ancient DNA have shown that, in prehuman times, it was far more widespread on the western side of the South Island and lived in the lower half of the North Island, where it was the only kiwi species detected.[^28] |
|  | *Apteryx australis* | [Southern brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_brown_kiwi "Southern brown kiwi"), tokoeka or common kiwi | South Island | Almost as big as the great spotted kiwi and similar in appearance to the brown kiwi, though its plumage is lighter in colour. It is relatively numerous. Ancient DNA studies have shown that, in prehuman times, the distribution of this species included the east coast of the South Island.[^28] Several subspecies are recognised: - The Stewart Island southern brown kiwi, *Apteryx australis lawryi*, is from [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island_/_Rakiura "Stewart Island / Rakiura").[^29] - The northern Fiordland tokoeka (*Apteryx australis?*) and southern Fiordland tokoeka (*Apteryx australis?*) live in [Fiordland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiordland "Fiordland"), the remote southwest part of the South Island. These subspecies of tokoeka are relatively common and are nearly 40 cm (16 in) tall. - The Haast southern brown kiwi or [Haast tokoeka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haast_tokoeka "Haast tokoeka"), *Apteryx australis 'Haast'*, is the rarest taxon of kiwi with only about 300 individuals. It was identified as a distinct form in 1993. It occurs only in a restricted area in the [Haast Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Haast_Range&action=edit&redlink=1 "Haast Range (page does not exist)") of the Southern Alps at an altitude of 1,500 m (4,900 ft). This form is distinguished by a more strongly downcurved bill and more rufous plumage.[^29] |
|  | *Apteryx mantelli* or *Apteryx australis* | [North Island brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi") | [North Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island "North Island") | *A. mantelli* (or *A. australis* before 2000 and still in some sources) females stand about 40 cm (16 in) tall and weigh about 2.8 kg (6.2 lb), while the males weigh about 2.2 kg (4.9 lb). The plumage is streaky red-brown and spiky. The female usually lays two eggs, which are incubated by the male.[^30] The North Island brown has demonstrated a remarkable resilience: it adapts to a wide range of habitats, including non-native forests and some farmland. It is widespread in the northern two-thirds of the North Island and is the most common kiwi, with about 35,000 remaining.[^31] |
|  | *[Apteryx littoralis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apteryx_littoralis "Apteryx littoralis")* | "Kiwi of the shore" | [North Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island "North Island") | *A. littoralis* is the only known extinct species of *Apteryx*, known from Pleistocene-age rocks that are roughly one million years old. The holotype, NMNZ S.36731, is a tarsometatarsus. The holotype was found to be most similar to the Okarito and North Island brown kiwi, although it was stouter and proportionally more narrow. It is thought to have been restricted to coastal habitats due to volcanism present on the North Island at this time.[^32] |

## Description

Clockwise from left: brown kiwi (*Apteryx australis*), little spotted kiwi (*Apteryx owenii*) and great spotted kiwi (*Apteryx haastii*) at Auckland War Memorial Museum

1860s drawing of *Apteryx*, illustrating its distinctive features, including long beak, short legs and claws, and dark hair-like feathers.

Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other [ratites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratites "Ratites") ([ostrich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich "Ostrich"), [emu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu "Emu"), [rhea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_\(bird\) "Rhea (bird)") and [cassowary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary "Cassowary")), they have no [keel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel_\(bird_anatomy\) "Keel (bird anatomy)") on the [sternum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum "Sternum") to anchor wing muscles. The [vestigial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality "Vestigiality") wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have [marrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow "Bone marrow"), like mammals and the young of other birds. Like most other ratites, they have no [uropygial gland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uropygial_gland "Uropygial gland") ([preen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preening "Preening") gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced [pecten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecten_oculi "Pecten oculi"). Their feathers lack [barbules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbule "Barbule") and [aftershafts](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aftershaft "wikt:aftershaft"), and they have large [vibrissae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrissae "Vibrissae") around the [gape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gape "Gape"). They have 13 [flight feathers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_feather "Flight feather"), no tail and a small [pygostyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygostyle "Pygostyle"). Their [gizzard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizzard "Gizzard") is weak and their [caecum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caecum "Caecum") is long and narrow.[^33]

The eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species, resulting in the smallest visual field as well. The eye has small specialisations for a [nocturnal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal "Nocturnal") lifestyle, but kiwi rely more heavily on their other senses (auditory, olfactory, and [somatosensory system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system "Somatosensory system")). The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature, showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging. In an experiment, it was observed that one-third of a population of *A. rowi* in New Zealand under no environmental stress had ocular lesions in one or both eyes. The same experiment examined three specific specimens that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular abnormalities.[^34] A 2018 study revealed that the kiwi's closest relatives, the extinct [elephant birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_bird "Elephant bird"), also shared this trait despite their great size.[^35]

Unlike virtually every other [palaeognath](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeognath "Palaeognath"), which are generally small-brained by bird standards, kiwi have proportionally large [encephalisation quotients](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization_quotient "Encephalization quotient"). Hemisphere proportions are even similar to those of [parrots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrots "Parrots") and [songbirds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbirds "Songbirds"), though there is no evidence of similarly complex behaviour.[^36]

The call of a male North Island Brown Kiwi *Apteryx mantelli*

Before the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were [three species of bat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_of_New_Zealand#Order:_Chiroptera_\(bats\) "List of mammals of New Zealand"), and the [ecological niches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche "Ecological niche") that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles, insects and gastropods).[^37]

The kiwi's mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate [podocarp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarp "Podocarp") and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains.[^33] Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.[^33] This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey, but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that *A. australis* can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.[^38]

Relative size of the [egg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg "Bird egg")

Once bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20 years.[^39] They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of [ovaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovaries "Ovaries"). (In most birds and in [platypuses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus "Platypus"), the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.[^33] [^40] [^41]).

Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays one of the largest eggs in proportion to its size of any bird in the world,[^42] [^4] so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg.[^45] Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female, helped by their inability to fly that could limit the extent by its body weight; brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as 450 g (16 oz).[^33] The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white.[^46] The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, *A. haastii*, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92 days.[^33] Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.[^47]

It was believed that the large eggs were a trait of much larger [moa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa "Moa") -like ancestors, and that kiwi retained large eggs as an evolutionarily neutral trait as they became smaller. However, research in the early 2010s suggested that kiwi were descended from smaller flighted birds that flew to New Zealand and Madagascar, where they gave rise to kiwi and elephant birds. The large egg is instead thought to be an adaptation for [precocity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precociality "Precociality"), enabling kiwi chicks to hatch mobile and with yolk to sustain them for two and half weeks. The large eggs would be safe in New Zealand's historical absence of egg-eating ground predators, while the mobile chicks would be able to evade chick-eating flying predators.[^48]

## Pests

[Lice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lice "Lice") in the genus *[Apterygon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apterygon "Apterygon")* [^49] [^50] [^51] and in the subgenus *[Rallicola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallicola "Rallicola")* (*Aptericola*) [^52] [^53] are exclusively [ectoparasites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoparasites "Ectoparasites") of kiwi species.[^54]

Traffic sign in New Zealand cautioning drivers of nearby kiwi

Nationwide studies show that only around 5–10% of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood without management.[^55] [^56] As of 2018 over 70% of kiwi populations are unmanaged.[^57] However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint [1080 poison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoroacetate "Sodium fluoroacetate") operation undertaken by DOC and the [Animal Health Board](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Health_Board_\(New_Zealand\) "Animal Health Board (New Zealand)") in [Tongariro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongariro "Tongariro") Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged.

Efforts to protect kiwi have had some success, and in 2017 two species were downlisted from endangered to vulnerable by the IUCN.[^58] In 2018 the [Department of Conservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_\(New_Zealand\) "Department of Conservation (New Zealand)") released its current Kiwi Conservation Plan.[^57]

### Sanctuaries

In 2000, the [Department of Conservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Department_of_Conservation "New Zealand Department of Conservation") set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers.[^59]

There are three kiwi sanctuaries in the North Island:
- Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary (for Northland [brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi")) [^60]
- Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary on the Coromandel Peninsula (Coromandel [brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi")) [^61] [^62]
- Tongariro Kiwi Sanctuary near Taupō (western [brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi")) [^63] [^64]

and two in the South Island:
- Okarito Kiwi Sanctuary ([Okarito kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okarito_kiwi "Okarito kiwi")) [^65]
- Haast Kiwi Sanctuary ([Haast tokoeka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haast_tokoeka "Haast tokoeka")) [^66] [^67]

A number of other [mainland conservation islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_island "Ecological island") and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi, including:

- [Zealandia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karori_Wildlife_Sanctuary "Karori Wildlife Sanctuary") fenced sanctuary in Wellington ([little spotted kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_spotted_kiwi "Little spotted kiwi")) [^68]
- [Maungatautari Restoration Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maungatautari_Restoration_Project "Maungatautari Restoration Project") in Waikato ([brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi")) [^69] [^70] [^71]
- [Bushy Park Forest Reserve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushy_Park_Forest_Reserve "Bushy Park Forest Reserve") near Kai Iwi, Whanganui ([brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi")) [^72]
- [Otanewainuku Forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Otanewainuku_Forest&action=edit&redlink=1 "Otanewainuku Forest (page does not exist)") in the [Bay of Plenty Region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Plenty_Region "Bay of Plenty Region") ([brown kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_brown_kiwi "North Island brown kiwi")) [^61] [^73]
- [Hurunui Mainland Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hurunui_Mainland_Island&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hurunui Mainland Island (page does not exist)"), south branch, Hurunui River, North Canterbury ([great spotted kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apteryx_haastii "Apteryx haastii"))

North Island brown kiwi were introduced to the [Cape Sanctuary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cape_Sanctuary&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cape Sanctuary (page does not exist)") in [Hawke's Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawke%27s_Bay_Region "Hawke's Bay Region") between 2008 and 2011, which in turn provided captive-raised chicks that were released back into Maungataniwha Native Forest.[^74]

Sanctuaries for kiwi are also referred to as 'kōhanga sites' [^69] from the Māori word for 'nest' or 'nursery'.[^75]

The West Coast Wildlife Centre, at [Franz Josef](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Josef_/_Waiau "Franz Josef / Waiau") on the southern West Coast of New Zealand, is part of Project Nest Egg, breeding the vulnerable local species of kiwi known as the [rowi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okarito_kiwi "Okarito kiwi").

Operation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust—a partnership between the [Bank of New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_New_Zealand "Bank of New Zealand"), the Department of Conservation and the [Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_and_Bird "Forest and Bird"). Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves—usually when they weigh around 1200 grams (42 ounces). They are then returned to the wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthood—compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and -raised chicks.[^76] The tool is used on all kiwi species except [little spotted kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_spotted_kiwi "Little spotted kiwi").

### 1080 poison

In 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public.[^77] He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Extensive monitoring shows that kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison.[^78]

### Threats

[Introduced mammalian predators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species_in_New_Zealand "Invasive species in New Zealand"), namely stoats, dogs, ferrets, and cats, are the principal threats to kiwi. The biggest threat to kiwi chicks is stoats, while dogs are the biggest threat to adult kiwi.[^56] [Stoats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoats_in_New_Zealand "Stoats in New Zealand") are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand. Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about 1–1.2 kg (2.2–2.6 lb) in weight, at which time they can usually defend themselves. Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks.[^56] These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the distinctive strong scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track, such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set [possum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_brushtail_possum_in_New_Zealand "Common brushtail possum in New Zealand") traps often kill or maim kiwi.[^79]

Habitat destruction is another major threat to kiwi; restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding.[^56] Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality (accidents, etc.) results in less than 5% of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood.[^55]

The [Māori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_mythology "Māori mythology") traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of [Tāne Mahuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C4%81ne "Tāne"), god of the forest. They were used as food and their feathers were used for [kahu kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahu_kiwi "Kahu kiwi") —ceremonial cloaks.[^80] Today, while kiwi feathers are still used, they are gathered from birds that die naturally, through road accidents, or predation, and from captive birds.[^81] Kiwi are no longer hunted and some Māori consider themselves the birds' guardians.[^16]

### Scientific documentation

In 1813, [George Shaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shaw_\(biologist\) "George Shaw (biologist)") named the genus *Apteryx* in his [species description](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_description "Species description") of the southern brown kiwi, which he called "the southern apteryx". Captain Andrew Barclay of the ship *[Providence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_\(1807_ship\) "Providence (1807 ship)")* provided Shaw with the specimen. Shaw's description was accompanied by two plates, engraved by [Frederick Polydore Nodder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Polydore_Nodder "Frederick Polydore Nodder"); they were published in volume 24 of *The Naturalist's Miscellany*.[^82]

### Zoos

In 1851, [London Zoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo "London Zoo") became the first zoo to keep kiwi. The first captive breeding took place in 1945.[^83] As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi.[^84] The [Frankfurt Zoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Zoo "Frankfurt Zoo") has 12, the [Berlin Zoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Zoo "Berlin Zoo") has seven, [Walsrode Bird Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsrode_Bird_Park "Walsrode Bird Park") has one, the [Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelpark_Avifauna "Vogelpark Avifauna") has three, the [San Diego Zoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo "San Diego Zoo") has five, the [San Diego Zoo Safari Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Safari_Park "San Diego Zoo Safari Park") has one, the [National Zoo in Washington, DC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_\(United_States\) "National Zoological Park (United States)") has eleven, the [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Conservation_Biology_Institute "Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute") has one, and the [Columbus Zoo and Aquarium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Zoo_and_Aquarium "Columbus Zoo and Aquarium") has three.[^85] [^86]

In 2023, [Zoo Miami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Miami "Zoo Miami") apologised for mistreating [a kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paora "Paora"), after footage of visitors patting the nocturnal bird under bright lights caused outrage in New Zealand.[^87]

The kiwi on an 1898 New Zealand stamp

The kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges. It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887. Soon after, the kiwi appeared in many military badges; and in 1906, when [Kiwi Shoe Polish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_\(shoe_polish\) "Kiwi (shoe polish)") was widely sold in the UK and the US, the symbol became more widely known.[^88]

During the First World War, the name "Kiwis" for New Zealand soldiers came into general use, and a giant kiwi (now known as the [Bulford kiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulford_kiwi "Bulford kiwi")) was carved on the chalk hill above [Sling Camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_Camp "Sling Camp") in England. Usage has become so widespread that all New Zealanders overseas and at home are now commonly referred to as " [Kiwis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_\(nickname\) "Kiwi (nickname)") ".[^89]

The kiwi has since become the best-known national symbol for New Zealand, and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms, crests and badges of many New Zealand cities, clubs and organisations. At the national level, the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the centre of the [roundel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundel "Roundel") of the [Royal New Zealand Air Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force "Royal New Zealand Air Force").[^46] [^90] The kiwi is featured in the logo of the [New Zealand Rugby League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Rugby_League "New Zealand Rugby League"), and the [New Zealand national rugby league team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team "New Zealand national rugby league team") are nicknamed the Kiwis.

A kiwi has featured on the reverse side of three New Zealand coins: the one florin (two-shilling) coin from 1933 to 1966, the twenty-cent coin from 1967 to 1990, and the one-dollar coin since 1991. In [currency trading](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market "Foreign exchange market") the [New Zealand dollar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar "New Zealand dollar") is often referred to as "the kiwi".[^91]

A song, "Sticky Beak the Kiwi", with words by Bob Edwards and music by Neil Roberts, was recorded in 1961, sung by Julie Nelson (aged 14) and accompanied by the Satins and the Don Bell Orchestra of [Whangārei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whang%C4%81rei "Whangārei"). A Christmas song, it portrays Sticky Beak as insisting on pulling Santa Claus's sleigh when distributing presents south of the equator.[^92]

"How the Kiwi Lost its Wings" is a fable written by broadcaster Alwyn Owen in 1963. It uses elements of Māori mythology, such as [Tāne Mahuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C4%81ne_Mahuta "Tāne Mahuta"), and the World War I symbol of cowardice, [white feathers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_feather "White feather"), in a [pourquoi story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pourquoi_story "Pourquoi story") explaining features of New Zealand birds. Owen portrays the kiwi as nobly sacrificing its wings and flight in order to protect the trees from depredation by ground-dwelling creatures, and thereby winning its unique renown. Owen's story is sometimes described as "A Maori Legend".[^93] [^94] It has been recorded as a children's story,[^95] published as a book,[^96] was made into an animated film in 1980,[^97] set to music for the [Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Philharmonia_Orchestra "Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra") by Thomas Goss as "Tāne and the Kiwi" in 2002 (recorded for [RNZ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNZ "RNZ") by [Orchestra Wellington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra_Wellington "Orchestra Wellington") in 2008 [^98]), and performed as a ballet by the [Royal New Zealand Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Ballet "Royal New Zealand Ballet") in 2022.[^99]
