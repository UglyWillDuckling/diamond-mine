I have a free six month trial for Apple Music and I decided to claim it today. While trying to claim it, I got a message saying I need to update my account by going to appleid.apple.com. As I was my account, I got to the "Apple ID & Privacy" page and when I try to press the continue button, nothing happens. I tried updating my account on the website and it was no good either. Any suggestions?

> 
> Find someone that owns an iPhone / iPad and wants to help you. (Don't worry, you won't mess up the owners apple id.)
> 
> Open App-store, select the current account, top right and scroll down to the bottom, press log out.
> 
> Sign in with your newly created appleID, you will be asked to enter a password that is sent via e-mail and a mfa code sent to your phone number.
> 
> Now App store is activated on your account and you can log out from the device that you used for this. The owner must now login again with their account.
> 
> Please note: There usually isn't a requirement to have a apple device, but untill Apple fix their site, this is the easist fix.

> I can't believe that I have to buy a fucking iPhone in order to use Apple Music service on my TV, I'm stuck at the same step, they ask me for a bunch of verification codes and then they leave me stuck in this button too, and when I try to log in they tell me that to verify my account I have to log in on iOS. I've tried to login directly from my TV or Windows computer and an error message pops out. Definitely I'm unsubscribing from this stupid ass shit. These errors seem like a barrier for Android users from using their services.
