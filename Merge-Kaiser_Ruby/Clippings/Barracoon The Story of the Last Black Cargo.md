**Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"*** is a non-fiction work by [Zora Neale Hurston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston "Zora Neale Hurston").

It is based on her interviews in 1927 with Oluale Kossola (also known as [Cudjoe Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudjoe_Lewis "Cudjoe Lewis")) who was presumed to be the last survivor of the [Middle Passage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage "Middle Passage").[^1] [^2] Two female survivors were subsequently recognized but Cudjoe continued to be identified as the last living person with clear memories of life in Africa before passage and enslavement.

Hurston could not find a publisher for her manuscript during her lifetime, partly because she preserved Cudjoe Lewis's [vernacular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular "Vernacular") English in quoting him from their interviews and partly because she described the involvement of other African people in the business aspects of [Atlantic slave trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade "Atlantic slave trade"). The manuscript, which was in the [Alain Locke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Locke "Alain Locke") Collection at the [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorland-Spingarn_Research_Center "Moorland-Spingarn Research Center"), [Howard University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University "Howard University"), remained unpublished until the 21st century.[^3] [^4] Excerpts were first published in *[Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wrapped_in_Rainbows:_The_Life_of_Zora_Neale_Hurston&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston (page does not exist)")*, a 2003 biography of Hurston by [Valerie Boyd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Boyd "Valerie Boyd"); the full book *Barracoon* was published in 2018.[^3] [^5]
