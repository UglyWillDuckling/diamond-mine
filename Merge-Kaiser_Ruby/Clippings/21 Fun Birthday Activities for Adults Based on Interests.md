## Birthday Party Ideas for Music Lovers

For those who are passionate about music, these ideas are sure to hit the right note. Guests can enjoy a variety of music-themed activities that celebrate their love for music and provide a fun and memorable birthday celebration. You can even do a specific theme, like a [Taylor Swift birthday party](https://www.gigsalad.com/blog/taylor-swift-birthday-party/)!

### üéß Silent Disco

Silent discos are a unique and interactive way to enjoy music with friends. Each guest wears wireless headphones and can tune in to different music channels, allowing everyone to dance to their own beat. This is a fun and engaging experience that will keep the party going all night long.

For a DIY silent disco, create playlists on your music streamer of choice for guests to choose from. Then, provide or ask guests to bring their own noise-canceling headphones. If you want a more streamlined experience, search for [local DJs](https://www.gigsalad.com/Disc-Jockeys-DJs/Event-DJ) or companies with silent disco setups to handle everything for you.

### üíÉ Dance Class

Learning some new moves is a fun and energetic birthday party idea for those who love grooving to their favorite tunes. From hip hop to salsa dancing, there are all kinds of fun routines to try and master. And even if you don‚Äôt master them, you‚Äôre sure to have a lot of laughs along the way.

Have your guests meet at a studio, or hire a [dance instructor](https://www.gigsalad.com/Dance/Dance-Instructor) to come to you. Let them teach you some basic steps, and then you can go out and put those new skills to the test on the dance floor. Dancing is a great way to celebrate with friends and make lifelong memories.

### üé∏ House Concert

Concerts have always been a great way to make memories with loved ones, so it‚Äôs a perfect birthday activity for adults who love music. Rather than going out to enjoy a show with the masses, [host a house concert](https://www.gigsalad.com/blog/how-to-host-a-house-concert/) for an intimate and memorable birthday celebration.

Clear a performance space, set up cozy seating around it, and hire a local musician or band to create a personal and exclusive concert experience for you and your guests. Because of the limited space, stick with a small [acoustic band](https://www.gigsalad.com/Music-Groups/Acoustic-Band) or a solo [singing guitarist](https://www.gigsalad.com/Solo-Musicians/Singing-Guitarist) with a repertoire of original and cover songs.

## Birthday Party Ideas for Creatives

If you‚Äôre the artistic and imaginative type, try one of these more hands-on adult birthday party ideas. Guests can work on their creativity and self-expression with personalized creations they can take home with them.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Crafting Party

While doing arts and crafts together is a popular option for children‚Äôs parties, it‚Äôs also a great birthday activity for adults‚Äîespecially if the birthday person and their crowd are filled with creative and talented individuals. Everyone gets to make their own party favor to remember the event by!

Consider interests and skill levels when choosing what to craft. You can scrapbook together, host a crochet or knitting night, or make jewelry. Friendship bracelets are low-cost and easy to make, so they are a great option. And Taylor Swift-approved!

### üî® DIY Night

Take that simple craft party to the next level with a bigger DIY project. This birthday party idea is for more experienced DIYers‚Äîthe ones who are always creating their own home decor or furniture. This activity may be best suited for a smaller gathering to save cost on supplies and keep everyone engaged.

There are a couple of ways to organize a group DIY night. You can find small individual DIY projects, like building a piece of home decor that each person can personalize to themselves. Or, if the birthday person has a big project they want to tackle, grab some pizza and make it a party with everyone lending a hand!

### üé® Painting Party

If art is more your creative lane, then a painting party is a great birthday party idea. Paint-and-sip events are becoming increasingly popular for all types of gatherings because they give guests a creative and social activity to engage in.

You can probably find a local studio that hosts these types of events and try to reserve enough spots for your whole group. If you have the space and want a more intimate experience, hire a [painting party professional](https://www.gigsalad.com/Variety/Painting-Party) who will come to you and provide instruction to your party guests.

Pasta parties have been around for a while, but not many people are familiar with them. They‚Äôre a pretty simple concept: Each guest brings a unique pasta dish of their choosing.
