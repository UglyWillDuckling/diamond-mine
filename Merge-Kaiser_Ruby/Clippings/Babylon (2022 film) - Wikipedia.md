***Babylon*** is a 2022 American [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film "Epic film") [historical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama "Historical drama") [black comedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy "Black comedy") film written and directed by [Damien Chazelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Chazelle "Damien Chazelle"). It features an [ensemble cast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast "Ensemble cast") that includes [Brad Pitt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt "Brad Pitt"), [Margot Robbie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie "Margot Robbie"), [Diego Calva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Calva "Diego Calva"), [Jean Smart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Smart "Jean Smart"), [Jovan Adepo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovan_Adepo "Jovan Adepo") and [Li Jun Li](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Jun_Li "Li Jun Li"). It chronicles the rise and fall of many characters during Hollywood's change from [silent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film "Silent film") to [sound films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_films "Sound films") in the late [1920s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920s_in_film "1920s in film").

Chazelle began developing *Babylon* in July 2019, with [Lionsgate Films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Films "Lionsgate Films") as the frontrunner to acquire the project. It was announced that [Paramount Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") had acquired worldwide rights in November 2019. Much of the main cast joined the project between January 2020 and August 2021, and filming took place in Los Angeles from July to October 2021.

*Babylon* premiered at the [Samuel Goldwyn Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn_Theater "Samuel Goldwyn Theater") in Los Angeles on November 14, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 23, 2022. It was met with a polarising response from critics upon release and was a [box-office bomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-office_bomb "Box-office bomb"), grossing $63 million against a production budget of $78–80 million and losing Paramount $87 million. It received five nominations at the [80th Golden Globe Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_Golden_Globe_Awards "80th Golden Globe Awards") (including [Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Musical_or_Comedy "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy"), winning [Best Original Score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score")), three nominations at the [76th British Academy Film Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/76th_British_Academy_Film_Awards "76th British Academy Film Awards") (winning [Best Production Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Production_Design "BAFTA Award for Best Production Design")) and three nominations at the [95th Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/95th_Academy_Awards "95th Academy Awards"). Since its release, the film has received positive reception from critics and audiences in retrospect.

In Bel Air, 1926, Mexican immigrant Manuel "Manny" Torres helps transport an elephant to a [bacchanal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchanalia#Modern_usage "Bacchanalia") at the mansion of his employer, Kinoscope Studios boss Don Wallach. Witnessing this event rife with sex, jazz, and cocaine, Manny becomes smitten with Nellie LaRoy, a brash, ambitious self-declared "star" from [New Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey"). Manny, the son of impoverished Mexican refugees, shares his dream with her—to be part of something "bigger". He helps carry away young actress Jane Thornton, who overdosed on drugs with actor Orville Pickwick, having the elephant walk through to distract partygoers.

Also attending are Chinese-American gay [cabaret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret "Cabaret") -singer Lady Fay Zhu and African-American jazz trumpeter Sidney Palmer. The flamboyantly-dancing Nellie is spotted and swiftly recruited to replace Jane in a Kinoscope film. During filming, she crudely upstages [Constance Moore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Moore "Constance Moore"). Manny becomes a personal assistant to the benevolent, oft-married film star Jack Conrad, who helps him secure Kinoscope assistant jobs. When a camera is urgently needed for one of Jack's scenes, Manny procures it at the last moment, helping him climb the [studio system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system "Studio system") 's ranks.

Nellie becomes an " [it girl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl "It girl") " covered by gossip columnist Elinor St. John, who also follows Jack's career. As [sound film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film "Sound film") displaces silents in the late-1920s, Manny skillfully adapts. At Sidney's suggestion, he pitches films starring Sidney's orchestra to [Irving Thalberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg "Irving Thalberg") and becomes a studio executive. Nellie struggles to navigate sound film's demands (one cameraman dies filming her), and increases her drug use and gambling, tarnishing her reputation, despite Manny's assistance.

Nellie, shown to have an [institutionalized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment "Involuntary commitment") mother, eggs on her drunken father (and inept business manager) Robert to fight a rattlesnake at a party; he passes out. Nellie fights the snake, which bites her neck; Fay kills it and sucks out the venom. Nellie passionately kisses her.

By 1932, Jack's popularity is waning but he still finds work in low-budget [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer") films. As Hollywood's audience becomes less tolerant of [libertine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertine "Libertine") behavior, executives order Manny to [fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion "Social exclusion") Fay, a Kinoscope title-writer, because she is lesbian. While practicing lines with new wife Estelle, Jack is devastated to learn his longtime friend/producer, George Munn, has committed suicide.

Elinor and Manny try to revamp Nellie's image and get her into [high society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_society "High society"), but Nellie lashes out against upper-class snobbery at a party, demonstratively vomiting on [William Randolph Hearst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst "William Randolph Hearst"). Jack confronts Elinor over her cover story on his declining popularity; she explains that his star has faded, but he will be immortalized on film.

Comparatively light-skinned Sidney is offended when studio executives insist he don [blackface](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface "Blackface") to assuage [Southern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States") audiences' aversion to interracial orchestras; he leaves Kinoscope to perform live in black establishments.

Eccentric gangster James McKay threatens Nellie's life over her gambling debts. Manny rejects her pleas for help, but later secures funds from the movie-set drug-pusher/aspiring actor "The Count", and visits James with him to pay the debts. Manny panics upon learning the money is [counterfeit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_money "Counterfeit money"), made by his prop-maker. Raving about potential film ideas, the gangster drags them along to a subterranean gathering space for depraved [zoosadist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoosadism "Zoosadism") parties. When he realizes the cash is counterfeit, the two are nearly shot but escape, killing James's henchman Wilson.

Jack encounters Fay at a hotel party; she reveals her departure for Europe and [Pathé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path%C3%A9 "Pathé"). After returning to his hotel room, a despondent Jack shoots himself dead.

Manny asks Nellie to flee with him to Mexico, marry and start a new life; she eventually agrees. James's associate finds Manny, killing The Count and his roommate. When a terrified Manny loses control of his bladder, the hitman spares him on condition he leaves Los Angeles. While Manny gathers their belongings, Nellie reneges on her decision, dancing away into the night. A [montage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_\(filmmaking\) "Montage (filmmaking)") of newspaper clippings reveals Elinor's death at 76 and Nellie's death from a drug overdose at 34.

In 1952, Manny returns to California with his wife Silvia and young daughter, having fled to New York City and established a radio shop. He shows them the Kinoscope Studios entrance, then visits a nearby cinema alone to see *[Singin' in the Rain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain "Singin' in the Rain")*, whose depiction of the industry's transition from silents to talkies, albeit sanitized, moves him to tears. A century-spanning series of vignettes from various films follows. As the focus returns to *Singin'*, Manny tearfully smiles.

Damien Chazelle "voice cameos" as partygoers outside the bathroom Nellie hides in at one point in the film.[^9]

Writer and director [Damien Chazelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Chazelle "Damien Chazelle") (left), lead actor [Brad Pitt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt "Brad Pitt"), lead actress [Margot Robbie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie "Margot Robbie"), lead actor [Diego Calva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Calva "Diego Calva"), and actor/executive producer [Tobey Maguire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobey_Maguire "Tobey Maguire").

It was announced in July 2019 that [Damien Chazelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Chazelle "Damien Chazelle") had set his next project following *[First Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Man_\(film\) "First Man (film)")* (2018) as a [period drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_drama "Period drama") set in the [Golden Age of Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema "Classical Hollywood cinema"). [Lionsgate Films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Films "Lionsgate Films") was the frontrunner to acquire the project after distributing Chazelle's *[La La Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land "La La Land")* (2016), with [Emma Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Stone "Emma Stone") (also having worked on *La La Land*) and [Brad Pitt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt "Brad Pitt") in the mix to star.[^10] In November, [Paramount Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") acquired worldwide rights to the project, with Stone and Pitt still circling roles.[^11] Pitt confirmed his involvement in January 2020, describing the film as being set when the [silent film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film "Silent film") era transitioned into [sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film "Sound film").[^12] He was set to play a character modeled on actor-director [John Gilbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilbert_\(actor\) "John Gilbert (actor)").[^13]

By December 2020, [Margot Robbie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie "Margot Robbie") was in early negotiations to replace Stone, who exited the film due to scheduling conflicts, and [Li Jun Li](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Jun_Li "Li Jun Li") was also cast.[^14] [^15] Robbie was confirmed in March 2021, with [Jovan Adepo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovan_Adepo "Jovan Adepo") and [Diego Calva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Calva "Diego Calva") also joining.[^13] [^16]

In June, [Katherine Waterston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Waterston "Katherine Waterston"), [Max Minghella](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Minghella "Max Minghella"), [Flea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_\(musician\) "Flea (musician)"), [Samara Weaving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_Weaving "Samara Weaving"), [Rory Scovel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Scovel "Rory Scovel"), [Lukas Haas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukas_Haas "Lukas Haas"), [Eric Roberts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roberts "Eric Roberts"), [P.J. Byrne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.J._Byrne "P.J. Byrne"), [Damon Gupton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Gupton "Damon Gupton"), [Olivia Wilde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Wilde "Olivia Wilde"), [Spike Jonze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Jonze "Spike Jonze"), [Phoebe Tonkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Tonkin "Phoebe Tonkin"), and [Tobey Maguire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobey_Maguire "Tobey Maguire") (who is also an executive producer on the film) joined the cast.[^17] [^18] [^19] In July, [Jean Smart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Smart "Jean Smart") joined the cast,[^20] with [Chloe Fineman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Fineman "Chloe Fineman"), [Jeff Garlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Garlin "Jeff Garlin"), Telvin Griffin, and Troy Metcalf joining the cast the following month.[^21] [^22]

Filming was originally set to take place in California in mid-2020 but was postponed due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"). It began on July 1, 2021 and [wrapped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrap_\(filmmaking\) "Wrap (filmmaking)") on October 21, 2021.[^19] [^23] [^24] [^25] [^26] [Shea's Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea%27s_Castle "Shea's Castle") was used for the exterior shots of the mansion in the opening party scene, and interiors were shot inside the [Ace Hotel Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Hotel_Los_Angeles "Ace Hotel Los Angeles"). The [movie ranch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_ranch "Movie ranch"), Blue Sky Ranch, served as Kinescope Studios.[^27]

[Justin Hurwitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hurwitz "Justin Hurwitz"), a frequent collaborator of Chazelle, composed the film's score. Two tracks from the score, "Call Me Manny" and "Voodoo Mama," were released digitally on November 10, 2022, the latter track being used to underscore the film's first trailer. The soundtrack album was released by [Interscope Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interscope_Records "Interscope Records") on December 9, 2022.[^28]

In an essay for *[/Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki//Film "/Film")*, Robert Daniels asserts that *Babylon* is essentially a story of [identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_\(social_science\) "Identity (social science)") and [assimilation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation "Cultural assimilation") in early Hollywood. While noting the similarities it shares with films such as *[The Last Black Man in San Francisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Black_Man_in_San_Francisco "The Last Black Man in San Francisco")* (2019), *[Bamboozled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboozled "Bamboozled")* (2000), and *[Medicine for Melancholy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_for_Melancholy "Medicine for Melancholy")* (2008), Daniels focuses on character Manuel "Manny" Torres and his rise into the Hollywood studio system: "In the process, Manuel cuts off ties with his Mexican roots—though they live in Los Angeles, he never visits his family—he [Americanizes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanize "Americanize") his name to Manny, and at a party thrown by William Randolph Hearst, he presents himself as a Spaniard. Manuel becomes intoxicated by his proximity to the white capitalistic greed that governs Hollywood (and partly the [American dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream "American Dream") of [upward mobility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upward_mobility "Upward mobility")), causing him to traverse a tenuous betweenness of identity." Daniels writes that Manny's erasure of his identity is sparked by his fantasy romance with Nellie LaRoy—who represents what he loves about Hollywood: "An indefinable magical quality, upward mobility, picturesque happiness, and the ability to permanently define yourself." Daniels also adds that, while climbing the [social ladder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ladder "Social ladder"), Manny contributed to the mythology of Hollywood, recalling one scene where he expeditiously retrieved a camera for a large, destructive set and a picturesque scene is shot without future film audiences' knowledge of its production, and another scene where Manny pressures Black trumpeter Sidney Palmer to don [blackface](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface "Blackface") during the filming of a [jazz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz") [short](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film "Short film"), so that the lighting on the set doesn’t lighten his complexion in the final product.[^29]

Lisa Laman of *[Collider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_\(website\) "Collider (website)")* observed that *Babylon* functions as a rumination on how human beings try to outrun and ignore their innate mortality, pointing to the various nonchalant depictions of death (such as a newscaster's casual account of the suicide of a female Jack Conrad fan) as an especially discernible example of this thematic element. Laman also pointed to a key scene in the middle of *Babylon* concerning Conrad briefly being overwhelmed by the death of his friend George Munn before returning to his default unflappable persona to be another key instance of the feature functioning as a tragic meditation on people trying to evade the inevitable presence of death.[^30]

*Babylon* was first screened for critics and industry people on November 14, 2022, at the [Samuel Goldwyn Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn_Theater "Samuel Goldwyn Theater") in Los Angeles and in New York City the following day.[^31] It was released on December 23, 2022.[^32] The film was initially scheduled for a December 25, 2021, limited release and a January 7, 2022, wide release,[^11] but was later delayed by an entire year, with a December 25, 2022, limited release, and a January 6, 2023, wide release, due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic").[^33] In October, the film was moved two days earlier to the current date and set for a solely wide release instead.[^34]

The film was released on [VOD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOD "VOD") platforms on January 31, 2023, and on [Paramount+](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B "Paramount+") on February 21, 2023. It was released on [Blu-ray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray "Blu-ray"), [DVD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD "DVD") and [4K UHD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television "Ultra-high-definition television") a month later on March 21, 2023.[^35] [^36]

The first [red band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_band "Red band") trailer for *Babylon* premiered on September 12, 2022, at the [2022 Toronto International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Toronto_International_Film_Festival "2022 Toronto International Film Festival") during a Q&A event with Chazelle and TIFF CEO [Cameron Bailey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Bailey "Cameron Bailey"). It was released to the public the following day, alongside character posters of the main cast.[^37] [^38] Noting its uncensored nudity, profanity and drug use, several publications compared the trailer's atmosphere to that of films such as *[The Wolf of Wall Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street_\(2013_film\) "The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)")* and *[The Great Gatsby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby_\(2013_film\) "The Great Gatsby (2013 film)")* (both 2013), which star Robbie and Maguire, respectively.[^39] [^40] [^41] [^42] A featurette about the making of the film was released on November 21, 2022.[^43] The second and final trailer for the film and its theatrical release poster were released on November 28, 2022.[^44]

As Maggie Dela Paz notes at ComingSoon.net, "a brand new behind-the scenes featurette...highlight\[ing\] Chazelle’s ensemble cast of A-list stars and familiar supporting actors\[, and\] also featur\[ing\] commentary from the Oscar-nominated director as he talks about the challenge of handling this massive cast" was released on December 29, 2022.[^45]

*Babylon* grossed $15.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $48 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $63.4 million.[^7] [^6] *[Deadline Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood "Deadline Hollywood")* noted that with a combined production and promotion budget of around $160 million, *Babylon* would need to gross $250 million worldwide in order to [break-even](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break-even "Break-even").[^46] The site ultimately calculated that the film lost the studio $87.4million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[^47]

In the United States and Canada, *Babylon* was released alongside *[Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Houston:_I_Wanna_Dance_with_Somebody "Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody")*, and was initially projected to gross $12–15 million from 3,342 theaters over its four-day opening weekend.[^48] [^49] The film made $1.5 million on its first day (including Thursday-night previews) and went on to debut to just $3.5 million in its opening weekend (and a total of $5.3 million over the four days), finishing fourth at the box office. *Deadline* cited the general public's declining interest in [prestige films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestige_picture "Prestige picture"), the threat of a [tripledemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twindemic "Twindemic") surge in [COVID-19](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") and flu cases, and the nationwide impact of [Winter Storm Elliott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_December_2022_North_American_winter_storm "Late December 2022 North American winter storm") as reasons for lower-than-expected theater attendance.[^5] In its second weekend, the film made $2.6 million (a drop of 27.5%), finishing in fifth.[^50]

In Europe, the film took $3.3 million on its opening weekend in France and $1.6 million (£1.3 million) in the United Kingdom, coming second and third respectively at the box office.[^51]

Despite the film's polarizing response, [Justin Hurwitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hurwitz "Justin Hurwitz") 's score was praised by critics as one of the film's strengths, and earned him numerous accolades, including the [Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score") and a nomination for the [Academy Award for Best Original Score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Academy Award for Best Original Score").

According to [IndieWire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire "IndieWire") and *[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter "The Hollywood Reporter")*, as well as the opinion of Chazelle himself, response to the film was "polarized".[^52] [^53] On the [review aggregator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), *Babylon* holds an approval rating of 57% based on 363 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critics consensus reads: " *Babylon* ' s overwhelming muchness is exhausting, but much like the industry it honors, its well-acted, well-crafted glitz and glamour can often be an effective distraction." [^54] On [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[^55] Audiences polled by [CinemaScore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScore "CinemaScore") gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, while [PostTrak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostTrak "PostTrak") reported 74% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 47% saying they would definitely recommend it.[^5]

In his review for the *[San Francisco Chronicle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle "San Francisco Chronicle")*, [Mick LaSalle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_LaSalle "Mick LaSalle") praised Chazelle's ambition and direction, writing that " *Babylon* is what movie love really looks like." [^56] *THR* 's David Rooney described it as a "syncopated concentration of hedonistic revelry", praising the cast performances, score, cinematography, costume and production design, but criticizing the screenplay and direction—ultimately concluding "it’s hard to imagine the overstuffed yet insubstantial *Babylon* finding its way into many screen-classic montages".[^57] Conversely, Pete Hammond of *[Deadline Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood "Deadline Hollywood")* wrote that "it is guaranteed to be a movie that will stay in your head", commending the direction, production design, and performances.[^58]

In his review for *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")*, [Peter Bradshaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bradshaw "Peter Bradshaw") assigned the film three stars out of five, applauding the performances of Robbie and Pitt for elevating "a story in no hurry to engage with the true-life nastiness of its era".[^59] Writing for *[Vanity Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\(magazine\) "Vanity Fair (magazine)")*, [Richard Lawson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawson_\(writer\) "Richard Lawson (writer)") concurred with Bradshaw's sentiment, stating: "These are little islands in a sea of mannered chaos, but it begins to feel, as *Babylon* stretches out across three hours and eight minutes, that Chazelle has no clear idea where all of this is going." [^60] In a scathing review for [*Time*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)"), [Stephanie Zacharek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Zacharek "Stephanie Zacharek") highlighted Jun Li's performance, but criticized Chazelle's screenplay and direction, summarizing: " *Babylon* is a manic sprawl that only pretends to celebrate cinema. It's really about prurience, dumb sensation, self-congratulation and willful ignorance of history." [^61]

In his review for *[The Ringer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ringer_\(website\) "The Ringer (website)")*, Adam Nayman described *Babylon* as "a nauseous, high-calorie sugar rush of a movie that not only wants to have its cake and eat it too, but also to puke it up, smear it around, and cram it in the viewer's face". While praising Chazelle's direction and ambition, Nayman wrote that the film was a "deliberately designed career-killer" for the director.[^62] Writing less enthusiastically about the film in *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")*, Peter Debruge stated that " *Babylon* presents itself as the apotheosis of all that has come before, the *[ne plus ultra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_plus_ultra "Ne plus ultra")* of the medium's own potential, and indeed, it's an experience that won't be easily topped, in this or any year. But that doesn't make it great or even particularly coherent".[^63]

[Richard Brody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brody "Richard Brody") of *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* praised Chazelle's storytelling and characters, but criticized other aspects of his screenplay, ultimately concluding: "Artistically, what *Babylon* adds to the classic Hollywood that it celebrates is sex and nudity, drugs and violence, a more diverse cast, and a batch of kitchen-sink chaos that replaces the whys and wherefores of coherent thought with the exhortation to buy a ticket, cast one's eyes up to the screen, and worship in the dark." [^64] John Mulderig of *[The Catholic Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catholic_Review "The Catholic Review")* says, "Along the way, Robbie effervesces, Pitt charms and Calva smolders and endures. Yet Chazelle's depiction of Tinseltown's behind-the-scenes decadence takes needless explicitness to the point of obscenity. \[He\] repeatedly references...*Singin' in the Rain*, which unfolds in the same place and time. But comparisons with that beloved classic only highlight the ugliness of his own portrayal of human debasement." [^65]

Despite the polarizing response, later critical and public reevaluation has tended to focus more on the film's strengths while deeming it as a misunderstood masterpiece. Author [Stephen King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King "Stephen King") praised the film, calling it "utterly brilliant–extravagant, over the top, hilarious, thought-provoking" and "one of those movies that reviews badly and is acclaimed as a classic in 20 years." [^66] In August 2023, *IndieWire* ranked the film's score at number 15 on its list of "The 40 Best Movie Scores of the 21st Century," writing "Filled with booming trumpets and epic saxophone solos, it’s a truly epic score, perfectly fitting the changing world of ’20s and ’30s Los Angeles perfectly. But it’s the way the score builds upon its [motifs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_\(music\) "Motif (music)") and elements from song to song, that makes it special." [^67] In June 2024, *[Collider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_\(website\) "Collider (website)")* ranked it number 30 on its list of the "30 Best Movies of the 2020s So Far," with Jeremy Urquhart writing "It's another movie of his \[Chazelle\] about passion, a desire for greatness, and the ups and downs of pursuing one's dreams, only this time the scope is epic, with such an approach taken to investigating Hollywood in the 1920s and 1930s, instead of just one or two people, like his smaller/more personal movies. *Babylon* is dazzling from a technical perspective and has some of the best music composed for a movie in recent memory. It challenges, provokes, celebrates, and condemns all at once. It's overwhelming and messy, but history will likely be kind to it." [^68] In June 2025, *[IndieWire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire "IndieWire")* ranked the film at number 97 on its list of "The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far)." [^69] In July 2025, it was one of the films voted for the "Readers' Choice" edition of *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* ' list of "The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century," finishing at number 175.[^70]

- *[A Clockwork Orange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_\(film\) "A Clockwork Orange (film)")* (1971): Film by [Stanley Kubrick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick "Stanley Kubrick") (with heavy doses of sex, violence and reflection on art, like *Babylon*) which extensively uses the music from *[Singin' in the Rain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain "Singin' in the Rain")* (1952), including in the end credits (compared to *Babylon* ' s end scene showing *Singin' in the Rain*), albeit in a much more cynical and sarcastic way than in *Babylon*.

- *[The Wild Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Party_\(1975_film\) "The Wild Party (1975 film)")*, a 1975 [Merchant-Ivory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Ivory_Productions "Merchant Ivory Productions") film shot in Riverside, California, loosely based on [the 1926 narrative poem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Party_\(poem\) "The Wild Party (poem)") by [Joseph Moncure March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Moncure_March "Joseph Moncure March"), about an aging silent-era star attempting a comeback via a party with a huge guest-list of industry figures, to show them his new film. (The poem was also made into two musicals, a Broadway show which followed the poem very closely, and an off-Broadway production, which took some artistic liberties, but still less than the film.)
- *[The Last Tycoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Tycoon_\(1976_film\) "The Last Tycoon (1976 film)")* (1976): Film by [Elia Kazan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan "Elia Kazan"), based on the 1941 unfinished [novel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Tycoon "The Last Tycoon") by [F. Scott Fitzgerald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald "F. Scott Fitzgerald"), about early Hollywood artifice, skullduggery, sex, betrayal, and desperation, ending with studio head Monroe Stahr ([Robert De Niro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro")) walking off into the darkness, as Nellie does in *Babylon*.
