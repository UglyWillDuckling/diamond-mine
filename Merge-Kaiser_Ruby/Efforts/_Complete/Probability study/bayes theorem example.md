[[Probability study]]

**Example 1: Medical Diagnosis**

A patient shows symptoms of either pneumonia or bronchitis. Based on previous data, we know that 80% of patients with pneumonia have a fever, and 20% of patients with bronchitis have a
fever.

Initial probabilities:
P(pneumonia) = 0.6
P(bronchitis) = 0.4

New information: The patient has a fever.

Updated probabilities:
P(**pneumonia** | fever) = P(fever | pneumonia) \* P(pneumonia) / (P(fever))
= 0.8 \* 0.6 / (0.8 \* 0.6 + 0.2 \* 0.4)
= 0.75
