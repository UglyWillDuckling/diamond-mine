**James Arthur Baldwin** ([né](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_name "Birth name") **Jones**; August 2, 1924 – December 1, 1987) was an African-American writer and civil rights activist who garnered acclaim for his essays, novels, plays, and poems. His 1953 novel *[Go Tell It on the Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain_\(novel\) "Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)")* has been ranked by *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* magazine as one of the top 100 [English-language novels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%27s_List_of_the_100_Best_Novels "Time's List of the 100 Best Novels").[^1] His 1955 essay collection *[Notes of a Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_of_a_Native_Son "Notes of a Native Son")* helped establish his reputation as a voice for human equality.[^2] Baldwin was an influential public figure and orator, especially during the [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") in the United States.[^3][^4][^5]

Baldwin's fiction posed fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures. Themes of [masculinity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity "Masculinity"), sexuality, [race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_\(human_categorization\) "Race (human categorization)"), and [class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class") intertwine to create intricate narratives that influenced both the [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") and the [gay liberation movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_liberation_movement "Gay liberation movement") in mid-twentieth century America. His protagonists are often but not exclusively [African-American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American "African-American"); gay and bisexual men feature prominently in his work (as in his 1956 novel *[Giovanni's Room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%27s_Room "Giovanni's Room")*). His characters typically face internal and external obstacles in their search for self- and social acceptance.[^gournardoo-6]

Baldwin's work continues to influence artists and writers. His unfinished manuscript *[Remember This House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_This_House "Remember This House")* was expanded and adapted as the 2016 documentary film *[I Am Not Your Negro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Not_Your_Negro "I Am Not Your Negro")*, winning the [BAFTA Award for Best Documentary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Documentary "BAFTA Award for Best Documentary"). His 1974 novel *[If Beale Street Could Talk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk "If Beale Street Could Talk")* was adapted into a [2018 film of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk_\(film\) "If Beale Street Could Talk (film)"), which earned [widespread praise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accolades_received_by_If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk "List of accolades received by If Beale Street Could Talk").

### Life in Paris (1948–1957)

Disillusioned by the reigning prejudice against [Black people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people "Black people") in the United States, and wanting to gain external perspectives on himself and his writing, Baldwin settled in [[Paris]], [[France]], at the age of 24. Baldwin did not want to be read as "merely a [Negro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro "Negro"); or, even, merely a Negro writer."[^87] He also hoped to come to terms with his sexual ambivalence and escape from the hopelessness to which many young African-American men like himself succumbed.[^88]

In 1948, Baldwin received a $1,500 grant (equivalent to $19,022 in 2023)[^inflation-us-89] from a [Rosenwald Fellowship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenwald_Fellowship "Rosenwald Fellowship")[^footnotecampbell202147-90] in order to produce a book of photographs and essays that was to be both a catalog of churches and an exploration of religiosity in Harlem.
Baldwin worked with a photographer friend named Theodore Pelatowski, whom Baldwin met through [Richard Avedon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Avedon "Richard Avedon").[^footnoteleeming199463%e2%80%9364-91] Although the book (titled *Unto the Dying Lamb*) was never finished,[^footnoteleeming199463%e2%80%9364-91] the Rosenwald funding did allow Baldwin to realise his long-standing ambition of moving to France.[^footnoteleeming199464-92] After saying his goodbyes to his mother and his younger siblings, with forty dollars to his name, Baldwin flew from New York to Paris on November 11, 1948.[^footnoteleeming199464-92] He gave most of the scholarship funds to his mother.[^footnotekenan_199457-93] Baldwin would later give various explanations for leaving America—sex, [Calvinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism "Calvinism"), an intense sense of hostility which he feared would turn inward—but, above all, was the problem of race, which, throughout his life, had exposed him to a lengthy catalog of humiliations.[^94] He hoped for a more peaceable existence in Paris.[^footnotecampbell202154-95]

In Paris, Baldwin was soon involved in the cultural radicalism of the [Left Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rive_Gauche "Rive Gauche"). He started to publish his work in literary anthologies, notably *Zero*[^96] which was edited by his friend [Themistocles Hoetis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles_Hoetis "Themistocles Hoetis") and which had already published essays by [Richard Wright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_\(author\) "Richard Wright (author)").
[[Richard Wright (author)]]

Baldwin spent nine years living in Paris, mostly in [Saint-Germain-des-Prés](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-des-Pr%C3%A9s "Saint-Germain-des-Prés"), with various excursions to [Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"), and back to the United States.[^97] 
Baldwin's time in Paris was itinerant: he stayed with various friends around the city and in various hotels. Most notable of these lodgings was Hôtel Verneuil, a hotel in Saint-Germain that had collected a motley crew of struggling expatriates, mostly writers.[^footnoteleeming199466-98] This Verneuil circle spawned numerous friendships that Baldwin relied upon in rough periods.[^footnoteleeming199466-98] He was also extremely poor during his time in Paris, with only momentary respites from that condition.[^footnotecampbell202151-99] In his early years in Saint-Germain, he met [Otto Friedrich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Friedrich "Otto Friedrich"), [Mason Hoffenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Hoffenberg "Mason Hoffenberg"), [Asa Benveniste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_Benveniste "Asa Benveniste"), [Themistocles Hoetis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles_Hoetis "Themistocles Hoetis"), [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre "Jean-Paul Sartre"), [Simone de Beauvoir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir "Simone de Beauvoir"), [Max Ernst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ernst "Max Ernst"), [Truman Capote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote "Truman Capote"), and [Stephen Spender](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Spender "Stephen Spender"), among many others.[^100] Baldwin also met Lucien Happersberger, a Swiss boy, 17 years old at the time of their first meeting, who came to France in search of excitement.[^footnoteleeming199482-101] Happersberger and Baldwin began to bond for the next few years, eventually becoming his intimate partner and he became Baldwin's near-obsession for some time afterward. Baldwin and Happersberger remained friends for the next thirty-nine years.[^footnoteleeming199482%e2%80%9383-102][^103] Even though his time in Paris was not easy, Baldwin escaped from the aspects of American life that outraged him the most—especially the "daily indignities of [racism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States "Racism in the United States")."[^footnotecampbell202154-95] According to one biographer: "Baldwin seemed at ease in his Paris life; Jimmy Baldwin the [aesthete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics") and lover reveled in the Saint-Germain ambiance."[^footnoteleeming199470-104]

During his early years in Paris, prior to the publication of *[Go Tell It on the Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain_\(novel\) "Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)")* in 1953, Baldwin wrote several notable works. "The Negro in Paris", first published in *The Reporter*, explored Baldwin's perception of an incompatibility between Black Americans and Black Africans in Paris, because Black Americans had faced a "depthless alienation from oneself and one's people" that was mostly unknown to Parisian Africans.[^footnoteleeming199472-105] He also wrote "The Preservation of Innocence", which traced the violence against homosexuals in American life back to the protracted adolescence of America as a society.[^footnoteleeming199474-106] In the magazine *Commentary*, he published "Too Little, Too Late", an essay about Black American literature, and he also published "The Death of the Prophet", a short story that grew out of Baldwin's earlier writings of *Go Tell It on The Mountain*. In the latter work, Baldwin employs a character named Johnnie to trace his bouts of depression back to his inability to resolve the questions of filial intimacy raised by his relationship with his stepfather.[^footnoteleeming199476%e2%80%9377-107] In December 1949, Baldwin was arrested and jailed for receiving stolen goods after an American friend brought him bedsheets that the friend had taken from another Paris hotel.[^footnoteleeming199477%e2%80%9380-108] 
When the charges were dismissed several days later, to the laughter of the courtroom, Baldwin wrote of the experience in his essay "Equal in Paris", also published in *Commentary* in 1950.[^footnoteleeming199477%e2%80%9380-108] In the essay, he **expressed his surprise and his bewilderment at how he was no longer a "despised black man", instead, he was simply an American, no different from the white American friend who stole the sheet and was arrested with him**.[^footnoteleeming199477%e2%80%9380-108]

During his Paris years, Baldwin also published two of his three scathing critiques of [Richard Wright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_\(author\) "Richard Wright (author)")—"Everybody's Protest Novel" in 1949 and "Many Thousands Gone" in 1951. Baldwin criticizes Wright's work for being [protest literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_novel "Social novel"), which Baldwin despised because it is "concerned with theories and with the categorization of human beings, and however brilliant the theories or accurate the categorizations, they fail because they deny life."[^footnoteleeming199472-105] Protest writing cages humanity, but, according to Baldwin, "only within this web of ambiguity, paradox, this hunger, danger, darkness, can we find at once ourselves and the power that will free us from ourselves."[^footnoteleeming199472-105] Baldwin took Wright's *Native Son* and Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, both erstwhile favorites of Baldwin's, as [paradigmatic analysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigmatic_analysis "Paradigmatic analysis") examples of the protest novel's problem.[^footnoteleeming199472-105] The treatment of Wright's character [Bigger Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Thomas "Bigger Thomas") by socially earnest white people near the end of *Native Son* was, for Baldwin, emblematic of white Americans' presumption that for Black people "to become truly human and acceptable, \[they\] must first become like us. This assumption once accepted, the Negro in America can only acquiesce in the obliteration of his own personality."[^footnoteleeming199473-109] In these two essays, Baldwin came to articulate what would become a theme of his work: that [white racism toward Black Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_against_African_Americans "Racism against African Americans") was refracted through self-hatred and self-denia
> "One may say that the Negro in America does not really exist except in the darkness of \[white\] minds. \[...\] Our dehumanization of the Negro then is indivisible from our dehumanization of ourselves."

[^footnoteleeming199473-109][^110]
Baldwin's relationship with Wright was tense but cordial after the essays, although Baldwin eventually ceased to regard Wright as a mentor.[^footnotecampbell202165%e2%80%9370-111] Meanwhile, "Everybody's Protest Novel" had earned Baldwin the label "the most promising young Negro writer since Richard Wright."[^footnoteleeming199480-112]

Beginning in the winter of 1951, Baldwin and Happersberger took several trips to [Loèches-les-Bains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukerbad "Leukerbad") in Switzerland, where Happersberger's family owned a small chateau.[^footnoteleeming199485-113] By the time of the first trip, Happersberger had then entered a heterosexual relationship but grew worried for his friend Baldwin and offered to take Baldwin to the Swiss village.[^footnoteleeming199485-113] 
Baldwin's time in the village gave form to his essay "[Stranger in the Village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_the_Village "Stranger in the Village")", published in *[Harper's Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine "Harper's Magazine")* in October 1953.[^footnoteleeming199486-114] In that essay, Baldwin described some unintentional mistreatment and offputting experiences at the hands of Swiss villagers who possessed a racial innocence which few Americans could attest to.[^footnoteleeming199485-113] Baldwin explored how the bitter history which was shared by Black and white Americans had formed an indissoluble web of relations that changed the members of both races: "No road whatever will lead Americans back to the simplicity of this European village where white men still have the luxury of looking on me as a stranger."[^footnoteleeming199486-114]

Beauford Delaney's arrival in France in 1953 marked "the most important personal event in Baldwin's life" that year.[^footnoteleeming1994100-115] Around the same time, Baldwin's circle of friends shifted away from primarily white bohemians toward a coterie of Black American expatriates: Baldwin grew close to dancer Bernard Hassell; spent significant amounts of time at [Gordon Heath](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Heath "Gordon Heath")'s club in Paris; regularly listened to [Bobby Short](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Short "Bobby Short") and Inez Cavanaugh's performances at their respective haunts around the city; met [Maya Angelou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou "Maya Angelou") during her European tour of *[Porgy and Bess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess "Porgy and Bess")*; and occasionally met with writers Richard Gibson and [Chester Himes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Himes "Chester Himes"), composer [Howard Swanson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Swanson "Howard Swanson"), and even Richard Wright.[^footnoteleeming199499%e2%80%93100-116] In 1954, Baldwin accepted a fellowship at the [MacDowell writer's colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacDowell_\(artists%27_residency_and_workshop\) "MacDowell (artists' residency and workshop)") in New Hampshire to support the writing of a new novel and he also won a [Guggenheim Fellowship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Fellowship "Guggenheim Fellowship").[^footnoteleeming1994101-103-117] Also in 1954, Baldwin published the three-act play *[The Amen Corner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amen_Corner "The Amen Corner")* which features the preacher Sister Margaret—a fictionalized Mother Horn from Baldwin's time at Fireside Pentecostal—who struggles with a difficult inheritance and with alienation from herself and her loved ones on account of her religious fervor.[^footnoteleeming1994113-118] Baldwin spent several weeks in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), and particularly around [Howard University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University "Howard University") while he collaborated with [Owen Dodson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Dodson "Owen Dodson") for the premiere of *The Amen Corner.* Baldwin returned to Paris in October 1955.[^footnoteleeming1994112%e2%80%93120-119]

Baldwin decided that he would return to the United States in 1957, so in early 1956, he decided to enjoy what was to be his last year in France.[^footnoteleeming1994124-120] He became friends with [Norman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Mailer "Norman Mailer") and Adele Mailer, was recognized by the [National Institute of Arts and Letters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Arts_and_Letters "National Institute of Arts and Letters") with a grant, and he was set to publish *[Giovanni's Room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%27s_Room "Giovanni's Room")*.[^footnoteleeming1994124%e2%80%93125-121] Nevertheless, Baldwin sank deeper into an emotional wreckage. In the summer of 1956—after a seemingly failed affair with a Black musician named Arnold, Baldwin's first serious relationship since Happersberger—Baldwin overdosed on sleeping pills during a [suicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide "Suicide") attempt.[^footnoteleeming1994125-122] He regretted the attempt almost instantly and he called a friend who had him regurgitate the pills before the doctor arrived.[^footnoteleeming1994125-122] Baldwin went on to attend the [Congress of Black Writers and Artists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Black_Writers_and_Artists "Congress of Black Writers and Artists") in September 1956, a conference which he found disappointing in its perverse reliance on European themes while nonetheless purporting to extol African originality.[^footnoteleeming1994126-123]

Baldwin's first published work, a review of the writer [Maxim Gorky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky "Maxim Gorky"), appeared in *[The Nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation "The Nation")* in 1947.[^gorki-124][^thenation-125] He continued to publish there at various times in his career and was serving on its editorial board at the time of his death in 1987.[^thenation-125]

 [Café de Flore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_de_Flore "Café de Flore"), [Boulevard Saint-Germain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_Saint-Germain "Boulevard Saint-Germain"), [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), May 2019. In the large upstairs heated room (*SALLE AU 1<sup>er</sup> – CLIMATISÉE*) in 1952 Baldwin worked on his first novel *[Go Tell It on the Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain_\(novel\) "Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)")* (1953).

In 1953, Baldwin published his first novel, *[Go Tell It on the Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain_\(novel\) "Go Tell It on the Mountain (novel)")*, a semi-autobiographical *[bildungsroman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman "Bildungsroman")*. He began writing it when he was 17 and first published it in Paris. His first collection of essays, *[Notes of a Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_of_a_Native_Son "Notes of a Native Son")* appeared two years later. He continued to experiment with literary forms throughout his career, publishing poetry and plays as well as the fiction and essays for which he was known.

Baldwin's second novel, *[Giovanni's Room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%27s_Room "Giovanni's Room")*, caused great controversy when it was first published in 1956 due to its explicit homoerotic content.[^126] Baldwin again resisted labels with the publication of this work.[^balfour-127] Despite the reading public's expectations that he would publish works dealing with African-American experiences, *Giovanni's Room* is predominantly about white characters.[^balfour-127]

#### *Go Tell It on the Mountain* (1953)

Baldwin sent the manuscript for *Go Tell It on the Mountain* from Paris to New York publishing house [Alfred A. Knopf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_A._Knopf "Alfred A. Knopf") on February 26, 1952, and Knopf expressed interest in the novel several months later.[^footnoteleeming199487-128] To settle the terms of his association with Knopf, Baldwin sailed back to the United States in April 1952 on the [SS *Île de France*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_%C3%8Ele_de_France "SS Île de France"), where [Themistocles Hoetis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles_Hoetis "Themistocles Hoetis") and [Dizzy Gillespie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie "Dizzy Gillespie") were coincidentally also voyaging—his conversations with both on the ship were extensive.[^footnoteleeming199487-128] After his arrival in New York, Baldwin spent much of the next three months with his family, whom he had not seen in almost three years.[^footnoteleeming199488-129] Baldwin grew particularly close to his younger brother, David Jr., and served as best man at David's wedding on June 27.[^footnoteleeming199487-128] Meanwhile, Baldwin agreed to rewrite parts of *Go Tell It on the Mountain* in exchange for a $250 advance ($2,868 today) and a further $750 ($8,605 today) paid when the final manuscript was completed.[^footnoteleeming199488-129] When Knopf accepted the revision in July, they sent the remainder of the advance, and Baldwin was soon to have his first published novel.[^footnoteleeming199489-130] In the interim, Baldwin published excerpts of the novel in two publications: one excerpt was published as "Exodus" in *[American Mercury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mercury "American Mercury")* and the other as "Roy's Wound" in *[New World Writing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Writing "New World Writing")*.[^footnoteleeming199489-130] Baldwin set sail back to Europe on August 28 and *Go Tell It on the Mountain* was published in May 1953.[^footnoteleeming199489-130]

*Go Tell It on the Mountain* was the product of years of work and exploratory writing since his first attempt at a novel in 1938.[^footnoteleeming199492-131] In rejecting the ideological manacles of protest literature and the presupposition he thought inherent to such works that "in Negro life there exists no tradition, no field of manners, no possibility of ritual or intercourse", Baldwin sought in *Go Tell It on the Mountain* to emphasize that the core of the problem was "not that the Negro has no tradition but that there has as yet arrived no sensibility sufficiently profound and tough to make this tradition articulate."[^footnoteleeming199491-132] Baldwin biographer [David Leeming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Leeming "David Leeming") draws parallels between *Go Tell It on the Mountain* and [James Joyce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce")'s 1916 *[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man")*: to "encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race."[^footnoteleeming199464,_92-133] Baldwin himself drew parallels between Joyce's flight from his native [Ireland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland") and his own run from Harlem, and Baldwin read Joyce's tome in Paris in 1950, however, in Baldwin's *Go Tell It on the Mountain*, it would be the Black American "uncreated conscience" at the heart of the project.[^footnoteleeming199491%e2%80%9392-134]

The novel is a [bildungsroman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman "Bildungsroman") that explores the inward struggles of protagonist John Grimes, the illegitimate son of Elizabeth Grimes, to claim his own soul as it lies on the "[threshing floor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_3:12 "Matthew 3:12")"—a clear allusion to another John: [the Baptist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist"), born of another [Elizabeth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_\(biblical_figure\) "Elizabeth (biblical figure)").[^footnoteleeming199492-131] John's struggle is a metaphor for Baldwin's own struggle between escaping the history and heritage that made him, awful though it may be, and plunging deeper into that heritage, to the bottom of his people's sorrows, before he can shrug off his psychic chains, "climb the mountain", and free himself.[^footnoteleeming199492-131] John's family members and most of the characters in the novel are blown north in the winds of the Great Migration in search of the [American Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream "American Dream") and all are stifled.[^footnoteleeming199493-135] Florence, Elizabeth, and Gabriel are denied love's reach because racism assured that they could not muster the kind of self-respect that love requires.[^footnoteleeming199493-135] Racism drives Elizabeth's lover, Richard, to suicide—Richard will not be the last Baldwin character to die thus for that same reason.[^footnoteleeming199492-131] Florence's lover Frank is destroyed by searing self-hatred of his own Blackness.[^footnoteleeming199492-131] Gabriel's abuse of the women in his life is downstream from his society's emasculation of him, with mealy-mouthed religiosity only a hypocritical cover.[^footnoteleeming199492-131]

The phrase "in my father's house" and various similar formulations appear throughout *Go Tell It on the Mountain* and was even an early title for the novel.[^footnoteleeming199491-132] The house is a metaphor at several levels of generality: for his own family's apartment in Harlem, for Harlem taken as a whole, for America and its history, and for the "deep heart's core".[^footnoteleeming199491-132] John's departure from the agony that reigned in his father's house, particularly the historical sources of the family's privations, came through a [conversion experience](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_narrative "Conversion narrative").[^footnoteleeming199493-135] "Who are these? Who are they?" John cries out when he sees a mass of faces as he descends to the threshing floor: 'They were the despised and rejected, the wretched and the spat upon, the earth's offscouring; and he was in their company, and they would swallow up his soul."[^footnoteleeming199494-136] John wants desperately to escape the threshing floor, but "\[t\]hen John saw the Lord" and "a sweetness" filled him.[^footnoteleeming199494-136] The midwife of John's conversion is Elisha, the voice of love that had followed him throughout the experience, and whose body filled John with "a wild delight".[^footnoteleeming199494-136] Thus comes the wisdom that would define Baldwin's philosophy: per biographer David Leeming: "salvation from the chains and fetters—the self-hatred and the other effects—of historical racism could come only from love."[^footnoteleeming199494-136]

#### *Notes of a Native Son* (1955)

Baldwin's friend from high school, Sol Stein, encouraged Baldwin to publish an essay collection reflecting on his work thus far.[^footnoteleeming1994105-137] Originally, Baldwin was reluctant, saying he was "too young to publish my memoirs."[^footnoteleeming1994105-137] but he nevertheless produced a collection, *Notes of a Native Son,* that was published in 1955.[^footnoteleeming1994105-137] The book contained practically all of the major themes that run through his work: searching for self when racial myths cloud reality; accepting an inheritance ("the conundrum of color is the inheritance of every American"); claiming a birthright ("my birthright was vast, connecting me to all that lives, and to everyone, forever"); the artist's loneliness; love's urgency.[^footnoteleeming1994105%e2%80%93106-138] All the essays in *Notes* were published between 1948 and 1955 in *Commentary*, *The New Leader*, *Partisan Review*, *The Reporter*, and *Harper's Magazine*.[^footnoteleeming1994106-139] The essays rely on autobiographical detail to convey Baldwin's arguments, as all of Baldwin's work does.[^footnoteleeming1994106-139] *Notes* was Baldwin's first introduction to many white Americans and it became their reference point for his work: Baldwin was often asked: "Why don't you write more essays like the ones in *Notes of a Native Son*?"[^footnoteleeming1994106-139] The collection's title alludes to both Richard Wright's *Native Son* and the work of one of Baldwin's favorite writers, [Henry James](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James "Henry James")'s *[Notes of a Son and Brother](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_of_a_Son_and_Brother "Notes of a Son and Brother")*.[^footnoteleeming1994107-140]

*Notes of a Native Son* is divided into three parts: the first part deals with Black identity as artist and human; the second part addresses Black life in America, including what is sometimes considered Baldwin's best essay, the titular "Notes of a Native Son"; the final part takes the expatriate's perspective, looking at American society from beyond its shores.[^footnoteleeming1994108-141] Part One of *Notes* features "Everybody's Protest Novel" and "Many Thousands Gone", along with "Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough", a 1955 review of *[Carmen Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Jones_\(film\) "Carmen Jones (film)")* written for *Commentary*, in which Baldwin at once extols the sight of an all-Black cast on the [silver screen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_screen "Silver screen") and laments the film's myths about Black sexuality.[^footnoteleeming1994107%e2%80%93108-142] Part Two reprints "The Harlem Ghetto" and "Journey to Atlanta" as prefaces for "Notes of a Native Son". In "Notes of a Native Son", Baldwin attempts to come to terms with his racial and filial inheritances.[^footnoteleeming1994109-143] Part Three contains "Equal in Paris", "Stranger in the Village", "Encounter on the Seine", and "A Question of Identity". Writing from the expatriate's perspective, Part Three is the sector of Baldwin's corpus that most closely mirrors Henry James's methods: hewing out of one's distance and detachment from the homeland a coherent idea of what it means to be American.[^footnoteleeming1994109-143][^144]

Throughout *Notes*, when Baldwin is not speaking in [first-person](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_narrative "First-person narrative"), Baldwin takes the view of white Americans. For example, in "The Harlem Ghetto", Baldwin writes: "what it means to be a Negro in America can perhaps be suggested by the myths we perpetuate about him."[^footnoteleeming1994107-140] This earned some quantity of scorn from reviewers: in a review for *[The New York Times Book Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Book_Review "The New York Times Book Review")*, [Langston Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes "Langston Hughes") lamented that "Baldwin's viewpoints are half American, half Afro-American, incompletely fused."[^footnoteleeming1994107-140] Others were nonplussed by the handholding of white audiences, which Baldwin himself would criticize in later works.[^footnoteleeming1994107-140] Nonetheless, most acutely in this stage in his career, Baldwin wanted to escape the rigid categories of protest literature and he viewed adopting a white point-of-view as a good method of doing so.[^footnoteleeming1994107-140]

#### *Giovanni's Room* (1956)

Shortly after returning to Paris in 1956, Baldwin got word from [Dial Press](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial_Press "Dial Press") that *Giovanni's Room* had been accepted for publication.[^footnoteleeming1994121-145] The book was published that autumn.[^146]

In the novel, the protagonist David is in Paris while his fiancée Hella is in Spain. David meets the titular Giovanni at a bar; the two grow increasingly intimate and David eventually finds his way to Giovanni's room. David is confused by his intense feelings for Giovanni and has sex with a woman in the spur of the moment to reaffirm his heterosexuality. Meanwhile, Giovanni begins to prostitute himself and finally commits a murder for which he is [guillotined](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillotine "Guillotine").[^footnotecampbell2021108%e2%80%93109-147] David's tale is one of love's inhibition: he cannot "face love when he finds it", writes biographer James Campbell.[^footnotecampbell2021109-148] The novel features a traditional theme: the clash between the constraints of puritanism and the impulse for adventure and the subsequent loss of innocence that results.[^footnotecampbell2021109-148]

The inspiration for the murder in the novel's plot is an event dating from 1943 to 1944. A [Columbia University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") undergraduate named [Lucien Carr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Carr "Lucien Carr") murdered an older, homosexual man, David Kammerer, who made sexual advances on Carr.[^footnoteleeming1994133-149] The two were walking near the banks of the [Hudson River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River") when Kammerer made a pass at Carr, leading Carr to stab Kammerer and dump Kammerer's body in the river.[^footnotecampbell2021108-150] To Baldwin's relief, the reviews of *Giovanni's Room* were positive, and his family did not criticize the subject matter.[^footnoteleeming1994134-151]

Even from Paris, Baldwin was able to follow the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement in his homeland. In May 1954, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court "United States Supreme Court") ordered schools to desegregate "with all deliberate speed"; in August 1955 the racist [murder of Emmett Till](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Emmett_Till "Murder of Emmett Till") in [Money, Mississippi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money,_Mississippi "Money, Mississippi"), and the subsequent acquittal of his killers were etched in Baldwin's mind until he wrote *[Blues for Mister Charlie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_for_Mister_Charlie "Blues for Mister Charlie")*; in December 1955, [Rosa Parks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks "Rosa Parks") was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a [Montgomery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama "Montgomery, Alabama") bus; and in February 1956 [Autherine Lucy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autherine_Lucy "Autherine Lucy") was admitted to the [University of Alabama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama "University of Alabama") before being expelled when whites rioted.[^footnoteleeming1994121%e2%80%93122-152] Meanwhile, Baldwin was increasingly burdened by the sense that he was wasting time in Paris.[^footnoteleeming1994121-145] Baldwin began planning a return to the United States in hopes of writing a biography of [Booker T. Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington "Booker T. Washington"), which he then called *Talking at the Gates*. Baldwin also received commissions to write a review of [Daniel Guérin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gu%C3%A9rin "Daniel Guérin")'s *Negroes on the March* and [J. C. Furnas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Furnas "J. C. Furnas")'s *Goodbye to Uncle Tom* for *The Nation*, as well as to write about [William Faulkner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner "William Faulkner") and American racism for the *Partisan Review*.[^footnoteleeming1994123-153]

The first project became "The Crusade of Indignation",[^footnoteleeming1994123-153] published in July 1956.[^154] In it, Baldwin suggests that the portrait of Black life in *Uncle Tom's Cabin* "has set the tone for the attitude of American whites towards Negroes for the last one hundred years", and that, given the novel's popularity, this portrait has led to a unidimensional characterization of Black Americans that does not capture the full scope of Black humanity.[^footnoteleeming1994123-153] The second project turned into the essay "William Faulkner and Desegregation". The essay was inspired by Faulkner's March 1956 comment during an interview that he was sure to enlist himself with his fellow white Mississippians in a war over desegregation "even if it meant going out into the streets and shooting Negroes".[^footnoteleeming1994123-153] For Baldwin, Faulkner represented the "go slow" mentality on desegregation that tries to wrestle with the Southerner's peculiar dilemma: the South "clings to two entirely antithetical doctrines, two legends, two histories"; the southerner is "the proud citizen of a free society and, on the other hand, committed to a society that has not yet dared to free itself of the necessity of naked and brutal oppression."[^footnoteleeming1994123-153] Faulkner asks for more time but "the time \[...\] does not exist. \[...\] There is never time in the future in which we will work out our salvation."[^footnoteleeming1994123-153]

Baldwin initially intended to complete *[Another Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Country_\(novel\) "Another Country (novel)")* before returning to New York in the fall of 1957 but progress on the novel was slow, so he decided to go back to the United States sooner.[^footnoteleeming1994138-155][^156] Beauford Delaney was particularly upset by Baldwin's departure. Delaney had started to drink heavily and entered the [incipient stages of mental deterioration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauford_Delaney#Mental_deterioration "Beauford Delaney"), including complaining about hearing voices.[^footnoteleeming1994138-155][^157] Nonetheless, after a brief visit with [Édith Piaf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89dith_Piaf "Édith Piaf"), Baldwin set sail for New York in July 1957.[^footnoteleeming1994138-155]

Baldwin's third and fourth novels, *[Another Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Country_\(novel\) "Another Country (novel)")* (1962) and *[Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Me_How_Long_the_Train%27s_Been_Gone "Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone")* (1968), are sprawling, [experimental works](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_literature "Experimental literature")[^158] dealing with Black and white characters, as well as with [heterosexual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual "Heterosexual"), [gay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay "Gay"), and [bisexual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual "Bisexual") characters.[^159] Baldwin completed *Another Country* during his first, two-month stay in Istanbul (which ends with the note, Istanbul, Dec. 10, 1961). This was to be the first of many stays in Istanbul during the 1960s.[^:2-160]

Baldwin's lengthy essay "Down at the Cross" (frequently called *[The Fire Next Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fire_Next_Time "The Fire Next Time")* after the title of the 1963 book in which it was published)[^161] similarly showed the seething discontent of the 1960s in novel form. The essay was originally published in two oversized issues of *The New Yorker* and landed Baldwin on the cover of [*Time* magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)") in 1963 while he was touring the South speaking about the restive [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement "Civil Rights Movement"). Around the time of publication of *The Fire Next Time*, Baldwin became a known spokesperson for civil rights and a celebrity noted for championing the cause of Black Americans. He frequently appeared on television and delivered speeches on college campuses.[^palmer,_colin_a._2005-162] The essay talked about the uneasy relationship between Christianity and the burgeoning [Black Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam "Nation of Islam") movement. After publication, several [Black nationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_nationalists "Black nationalists") criticized Baldwin for his conciliatory attitude. They questioned whether his message of love and understanding would do much to change race relations in America.[^palmer,_colin_a._2005-162] The book was consumed by whites looking for answers to the question: What do Black Americans really want? Baldwin's essays never stopped articulating the anger and frustration felt by real-life Black Americans with more clarity and style than any other writer of his generation.[^163]

In 1965, Baldwin participated in [a much publicized debate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin%E2%80%93Buckley_debate "Baldwin–Buckley debate") with [William F. Buckley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley "William F. Buckley"), on the topic of whether the [American dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_dream "American dream") had been achieved at the expense of African Americans. The debate took place in the UK at the [Cambridge Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Union "Cambridge Union"), historic debating society of the [University of Cambridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"). The spectating student body voted overwhelmingly in Baldwin's favor.[^164][^:0-165]

Baldwin's next book-length essay, *[No Name in the Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Name_in_the_Street "No Name in the Street")* (1972), also discussed his own experience in the context of the later 1960s, specifically the assassinations of three of his personal friends: [Medgar Evers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Medgar_Evers "Assassination of Medgar Evers"), [Malcolm X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Malcolm_X "Assassination of Malcolm X"), and [Martin Luther King Jr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr "Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr").

Baldwin's writings of the 1970s and 1980s were largely overlooked by critics, although they have received increasing attention in recent years.[^altman2011-166] Several of his essays and interviews of the 1980s discuss [homosexuality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality") and [homophobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia "Homophobia") with fervor and forthrightness.[^palmer,_colin_a._2005-162] [Eldridge Cleaver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver "Eldridge Cleaver")'s harsh criticism of Baldwin in *[Soul on Ice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_on_Ice_\(book\) "Soul on Ice (book)")* and elsewhere[^167] and Baldwin's return to southern France contributed to the perception by critics that he was not in touch with his readership.[^168][^169][^170] As he had been the leading literary voice of the civil rights movement, he became an inspirational figure for the emerging gay rights movement.[^palmer,_colin_a._2005-162] His two novels written in the 1970s, *[If Beale Street Could Talk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk "If Beale Street Could Talk")* (1974) and *[Just Above My Head](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Above_My_Head "Just Above My Head")* (1979), stressed the importance of [Black American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_American "Black American") families. He concluded his career by publishing a volume of poetry, *Jimmy's Blues* (1983), as well as another book-length essay, *[The Evidence of Things Not Seen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evidence_of_Things_Not_Seen "The Evidence of Things Not Seen")* (1985), an extended reflection on race inspired by the [Atlanta murders of 1979–1981](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_murders_of_1979%E2%80%931981 "Atlanta murders of 1979–1981").

 The house where Baldwin lived and died in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France

Baldwin lived in France for most of his later life, using it as a base of operations for extensive international travel.[^:2-160][^171][^172] Baldwin settled in [Saint-Paul-de-Vence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Paul-de-Vence "Saint-Paul-de-Vence") in the [south of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_France "South of France") in 1970, in an old Provençal house beneath the [ramparts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_\(fortification\) "Rampart (fortification)") of the famous village.[^173] His house was always open to his friends, who frequently visited him while on trips to the [French Riviera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera "French Riviera"). American painter [Beauford Delaney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauford_Delaney "Beauford Delaney") made Baldwin's house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence his second home, often setting up his easel in the garden. Delaney painted several colorful portraits of Baldwin. [Fred Nall Hollis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Nall_Hollis "Fred Nall Hollis") also befriended Baldwin during this time. Actors [Harry Belafonte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Belafonte "Harry Belafonte") and [Sidney Poitier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Poitier "Sidney Poitier") were also regular guests.

Many of Baldwin's musician friends dropped in during the [Jazz à Juan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%C3%A0_Juan "Jazz à Juan") and [Nice Jazz Festivals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_Jazz_Festival "Nice Jazz Festival"). They included [Nina Simone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone "Nina Simone"), [Josephine Baker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Baker "Josephine Baker") (whose sister lived in Nice), [Miles Davis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis "Miles Davis"), and [Ray Charles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles "Ray Charles").[^174] In his autobiography, Miles Davis wrote:[^175]

> I'd read his books and I liked and respected what he had to say. As I got to know Jimmy we opened up to each other and became real great friends. Every time I went to southern France to play [Antibes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibes "Antibes"), I would always spend a day or two out at Jimmy's house in St. Paul de Vence. We'd just sit there in that great big beautiful house of his telling us all kinds of stories, lying our asses off.... He was a great man.

Baldwin learned to speak French fluently and developed friendships with French actor [Yves Montand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Montand "Yves Montand") and French writer [Marguerite Yourcenar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Yourcenar "Marguerite Yourcenar"), who translated Baldwin's play *[The Amen Corner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amen_Corner "The Amen Corner")* into French.

Baldwin spent 17 years, until his death in 1987, in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, in the south-east between Nice and Cannes.[^:1-176] The years he spent there were also years of work. Sitting in front of his sturdy typewriter, he devoted his days to writing and to answering the huge amount of mail he received from all over the world. He wrote several of his last works in his house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, including *[Just Above My Head](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Above_My_Head "Just Above My Head")* in 1979 and *Evidence of Things Not Seen* in 1985. It was also in Saint-Paul-de-Vence that Baldwin wrote his famous "Open Letter to My Sister, [Angela Y. Davis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Y._Davis "Angela Y. Davis")" in November 1970.[^177][^178]

His last novel, *Harlem Quartet*, was published in 1987.[^meislerlatimes1987-179]

In all of Baldwin's works, but particularly in his novels, the main characters are twined up in a "cage of reality" that sees them fighting for their soul against the limitations of the human condition or against their place at the margins of a society consumed by various prejudices.[^footnoteleeming199491,_128-202] Baldwin connects many of his main characters—John in *Go Tell It On The Mountain*, Rufus in *Another Country*, Richard in *Blues for Mister Charlie*, and Giovanni in *Giovanni's Room*—as sharing a reality of restriction: per biographer David Leeming, each is "a symbolic cadaver in the center of the world depicted in the given novel and the larger society symbolized by that world".[^footnoteleeming1994128-203] Each reaches for an identity within their own social environment, and sometimes—as in *If Beale Street Could Talk*'s Fonny and *Tell me How Long The Train's Been Gone*'s Leo—they find such an identity, imperfect but sufficient to bear the world.[^footnoteleeming1994128-203] The singular theme in the attempts of Baldwin's characters to resolve their struggle for themselves is that such resolution only comes through love.[^footnoteleeming1994128-203] Here is Leeming at some length:

> Love is at the heart of the Baldwin philosophy. Love for Baldwin cannot be safe; it involves the risk of commitment, the risk of removing the masks and taboos placed on us by society. The philosophy applies to individual relationships as well as to more general ones. It encompasses sexuality as well as politics, economics, and race relations. And it emphasizes the dire consequences, for individuals and racial groups, of the refusal to love.

Baldwin returned to the United States in the summer of 1957, while the [civil rights legislation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957 "Civil Rights Act of 1957") of that year was being debated in Congress. He had been powerfully moved by the image of a young girl, [Dorothy Counts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Counts "Dorothy Counts"), braving a mob in an attempt to desegregate schools in [Charlotte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina "Charlotte, North Carolina"), [North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina "North Carolina"), and *Partisan Review* editor [Philip Rahv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Rahv "Philip Rahv") had suggested he report on what was happening in the American South. Baldwin was nervous about the trip but he made it, interviewing people in Charlotte (where he met [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.")), and Montgomery, Alabama. The result was two essays, one published in *Harper's* magazine ("The Hard Kind of Courage"), the other in *Partisan Review* ("Nobody Knows My Name"). Subsequent Baldwin articles on the movement appeared in *Mademoiselle*, *Harper's*, *The New York Times Magazine*, and *The New Yorker,* where in 1962 he published the essay that he called "Down at the Cross", and the *New Yorker* called "Letter from a Region of My Mind". Along with a shorter essay from *The Progressive*, the essay became *The Fire Next Time*.[^polsgrove-205]

While he wrote about the movement, Baldwin aligned himself with the ideals of the [Congress of Racial Equality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality "Congress of Racial Equality") (CORE) and the [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee") (SNCC). Joining CORE allowed him to travel across the South, lecturing on racial inequality. His insights into both the North and South gave him a unique perspective on the racial problems the United States was facing.

In 1963 he conducted a lecture tour of the South for CORE, traveling to [Durham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina "Durham, North Carolina") and [Greensboro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro "Greensboro") in North Carolina, and [New Orleans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans"). During the tour, he lectured to students, white liberals, and anyone else listening about his racial ideology, an ideological position between the "muscular approach" of Malcolm X and the nonviolent program of Martin Luther King Jr.[^footnoteleeming1994134-151] Baldwin expressed the hope that [socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") would take root in the United States:[^207]

> It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.
> 
> —James Baldwin

By the spring of 1963, the mainstream press began to recognize Baldwin's incisive analysis of white racism and his eloquent descriptions of the Negro's pain and frustration. In fact, *Time* featured Baldwin on the cover of its May 17, 1963, issue. "There is not another writer", said *Time*, "who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of the racial ferment in North and South."[^208][^polsgrove-205] 

In a cable Baldwin sent to Attorney General [Robert F. Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy "Robert F. Kennedy") during the [Birmingham riot of 1963](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963 "Birmingham riot of 1963"), Baldwin blamed the violence in Birmingham on the [FBI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI"), [J. Edgar Hoover](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover "J. Edgar Hoover"), Mississippi Senator [James Eastland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland "James Eastland"), and President Kennedy for failing to use "the great prestige of his office as the moral forum which it can be." Attorney General Kennedy invited Baldwin to meet with him over breakfast, and that meeting was followed up with a second, when [Kennedy met with Baldwin and others](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin%E2%80%93Kennedy_meeting "Baldwin–Kennedy meeting") Baldwin had invited to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment. This meeting is discussed in Howard Simon's 1999 play, *[James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin:_A_Soul_on_Fire "James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire")*. The delegation included Kenneth B. Clark, a psychologist who had played a key role in the *[Brown v. Board of Education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education "Brown v. Board of Education")* decision; actor [Harry Belafonte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Belafonte "Harry Belafonte"), singer [Lena Horne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Horne "Lena Horne"), writer [Lorraine Hansberry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Hansberry "Lorraine Hansberry"), and activists from civil rights organizations.[^polsgrove-205]  Although most of the attendees of this meeting left feeling "devastated", the meeting was an important one in voicing the concerns of the civil rights movement, and it provided exposure of the civil rights issue not just as a political issue but also as a moral issue.[^footnoteleeming1994141-209]

James Baldwin's FBI file contains 1,884 pages, collected from 1960 until the early 1970s.[^210] During that era of surveillance of American writers, the FBI accumulated 276 pages on [Richard Wright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_\(author\) "Richard Wright (author)"), 110 pages on [Truman Capote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote "Truman Capote"), and just nine pages on [Henry Miller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Miller "Henry Miller").

Baldwin also made a prominent appearance at the [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom") on August 28, 1963, with Belafonte and long-time friends [Sidney Poitier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Poitier "Sidney Poitier") and [Marlon Brando](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando "Marlon Brando").[^211]

Baldwin's sexuality clashed with his activism. The civil rights movement was hostile to homosexuals.[^212][^213] The only overtly gay men in the movement were Baldwin and [Bayard Rustin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin "Bayard Rustin"). Rustin and King were very close, as Rustin received credit for the success of the March on Washington. Many were bothered by Rustin's sexual orientation. King himself spoke on the topic of sexual orientation in a school editorial column during his college years, and in reply to a letter during the 1950s, where he treated it as a mental illness which an individual could overcome. King's key advisor, [Stanley Levison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Levison "Stanley Levison"), also stated that Baldwin and Rustin were "better qualified to lead a homo-sexual movement than a civil rights movement".[^214] The pressure later resulted in King distancing himself from both men. Despite his enormous efforts within the movement, Baldwin was excluded from the inner circles of the civil rights movement because of his sexuality and was conspicuously not invited to speak at the March on Washington.[^215]

At the time, Baldwin was neither in the closet nor open to the public about his sexual orientation. Although his novels, specifically *[Giovanni's Room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%27s_Room "Giovanni's Room")* and *[Just Above My Head](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Above_My_Head "Just Above My Head")*, had openly gay characters and relationships, Baldwin himself never openly described his sexuality. In his book, Kevin Mumford points out how Baldwin went his life "passing as straight rather than confronting homophobes with whom he mobilized against racism".[^216]

When the [16th Street Baptist Church bombing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing "16th Street Baptist Church bombing") happened in Birmingham three weeks after the March on Washington, Baldwin called for a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience in response to this "terrifying crisis". He traveled to [Selma, Alabama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma,_Alabama "Selma, Alabama"), where SNCC had organized a voter registration drive; he watched mothers with babies and elderly men and women standing in long lines for hours, as armed deputies and state troopers stood by—or intervened to smash a reporter's camera or use cattle prods on SNCC workers. After his day of watching, he spoke in a crowded church, blaming Washington—"the good white people on the hill". Returning to Washington, he told a *New York Post* reporter the federal government could protect Negroes—it could send federal troops into the South. He blamed the Kennedys for not acting.[^polsgrove-205]  In March 1965, Baldwin joined marchers who walked 50 miles from Selma, Alabama ([Selma to Montgomery Marches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches "Selma to Montgomery marches")), to the capitol in Montgomery under the protection of federal troops.[^polsgrove-205] 

Nonetheless, he rejected the label "civil rights activist", or that he had participated in a [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement"), instead agreeing with [Malcolm X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X "Malcolm X")'s assertion that if one is a citizen, one should not have to fight for one's civil rights. In a 1964 interview with [Robert Penn Warren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Penn_Warren "Robert Penn Warren") for the book *[Who Speaks for the Negro?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Speaks_for_the_Negro%3F "Who Speaks for the Negro?")*, Baldwin rejected the idea that the civil rights movement was an outright revolution, instead calling it "a very peculiar revolution because it has to... have its aims the establishment of a union, and a... radical shift in the American mores, the American way of life... not only as it applies to the Negro obviously, but as it applies to every citizen of the country."[^217] In a 1979 speech at UC Berkeley, Baldwin called it, instead, "the latest [slave rebellion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_rebellion "Slave rebellion")".[^218]

In 1968, Baldwin signed the "[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_and_Editors_War_Tax_Protest "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest")" pledge, vowing to refuse to make income tax payments in protest against the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War").[^219] He was also a supporter of the [Fair Play for Cuba Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Play_for_Cuba_Committee "Fair Play for Cuba Committee"), which prompted the FBI to create a file on Baldwin.[^220]

## Inspiration and relationships

## Legacy and critical response

Literary critic [Harold Bloom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom "Harold Bloom") characterized Baldwin as being "among the most considerable moral essayists in the United States".[^bloom2007-231] Baldwin's influence on other writers has been profound: [Toni Morrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Morrison "Toni Morrison") edited the [Library of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_America "Library of America")'s first two volumes of Baldwin's fiction and essays: *Early Novels & Stories* (1998) and *Collected Essays* (1998). A third volume, *Later Novels* (2015), was edited by [Darryl Pinckney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Pinckney "Darryl Pinckney"), who delivered a talk on Baldwin in February 2013 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of *[The New York Review of Books](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Review_of_Books "The New York Review of Books")*, during which Pinckney said, "No other black writer I'd read was as literary as Baldwin in his early essays, not even [Ralph Ellison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Ellison "Ralph Ellison"). There is something wild in the beauty of Baldwin's sentences and the cool of his tone, something improbable, too, this meeting of [Henry James](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James "Henry James"), the [Bible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible"), and Harlem."[^232] One of Baldwin's richest short stories, "[Sonny's Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny%27s_Blues "Sonny's Blues")", appears in many anthologies of short fiction used in introductory college literature classes.

[Sammy J. Davis Jr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr. "Sammy Davis Jr.").'s song, *"Blues for Mister Charlie"*, published in 1965, included in the album "*[Our Shining Hours"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Shining_Hour "Our Shining Hour")* shares the same name with one of Baldwin's most famous play, also takes the same theme from the play, and expresses them through the emotive power of music.  In the song, Davis sings about the deep sorrow and anguish that the play’s events evoke, using the "blues" as a metaphor for the pain and suffering caused by systemic racism and the loss of Black life, just like Baldwin did with rallying.

 A Baldwin quotation (ultimately misquoted) used in graffiti during 2020's [George Floyd protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests "George Floyd protests") in [Indianapolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis "Indianapolis")

A street in [San Francisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco"), Baldwin Court in the [Bayview neighborhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayview-Hunters_Point,_San_Francisco "Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco"), is named after him.[^233] In 1987, Kevin Brown, a photojournalist from Baltimore, founded the National James Baldwin Literary Society. The group organizes free public events celebrating Baldwin's life and legacy. In 1992, [Hampshire College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire_College "Hampshire College") in [Amherst, Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst,_Massachusetts "Amherst, Massachusetts"), established the James Baldwin Scholars program, an urban outreach initiative, in honor of Baldwin, who taught at Hampshire in the early 1980s. The JBS Program provides talented students of color from under-served communities an opportunity to develop and improve the skills necessary for college success through coursework and tutorial support for one transitional year, after which Baldwin scholars may apply for full matriculation to Hampshire or any other four-year college program.

[Spike Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee "Spike Lee")'s 1996 film *[Get on the Bus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_on_the_Bus "Get on the Bus")* includes a Black gay character, played by [Isaiah Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Washington "Isaiah Washington"), who punches a homophobic character, saying: "This is for James Baldwin and [Langston Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes "Langston Hughes")." His name appears in the lyrics of the [Le Tigre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Tigre "Le Tigre") song "[Hot Topic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Topic_\(song\) "Hot Topic (song)")", released in 1999.[^234] In 2002, scholar [Molefi Kete Asante](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molefi_Kete_Asante "Molefi Kete Asante") included James Baldwin on his list of [100 Greatest African Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Greatest_African_Americans "100 Greatest African Americans").[^235]

 Baldwin votive candle, 2022

In 2005, the [United States Postal Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service "United States Postal Service") created a first-class postage stamp dedicated to Baldwin, which featured him on the front with a short biography on the back of the peeling paper. In 2012, Baldwin was inducted into the [Legacy Walk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_Walk "Legacy Walk"), an outdoor public display that celebrates [LGBT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT "LGBT") history and people.[^236] In 2014, East 128th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was named "James Baldwin Place" to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Baldwin's birth. He lived in the neighborhood and attended P.S. 24. Readings of Baldwin's writing were held at The National Black Theatre and a month-long art exhibition featuring works by New York Live Arts and artist Maureen Kelleher. The events were attended by Council Member Inez Dickens, who led the campaign to honor Harlem native's son; also taking part were Baldwin's family, theatre and film notables, and members of the community.[^237][^238]

Also in 2014, Baldwin was one of the inaugural honorees in the [Rainbow Honor Walk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Honor_Walk "Rainbow Honor Walk"), a [walk of fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_of_fame "Walk of fame") in San Francisco's [Castro neighborhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_District,_San_Francisco "Castro District, San Francisco") celebrating [LGBTQ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ "LGBTQ") people who have "made significant contributions in their fields."[^:022-239][^240][^:3-241] In 2014, The Social Justice Hub at [The New School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School "The New School")'s newly opened University Center was named the Baldwin Rivera Boggs Center after activists Baldwin, [Sylvia Rivera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Rivera "Sylvia Rivera"), and [Grace Lee Boggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Lee_Boggs "Grace Lee Boggs").[^242] In 2016, [Raoul Peck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck "Raoul Peck") released his documentary film *I Am Not Your Negro*. It is based on James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript, *[Remember This House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_This_House "Remember This House")*. It is a 93-minute journey into Black history that connects the past of the Civil Rights Movement to the present of [Black Lives Matter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter "Black Lives Matter"). It is a film that questions Black representation in Hollywood and beyond.

In 2017, [Scott Timberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Timberg "Scott Timberg") wrote an essay for the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")* ("30 years after his death, James Baldwin is having a new pop culture moment") in which he noted existing cultural references to Baldwin, 30 years after his death, and concluded: "So Baldwin is not just a writer for the ages, but a scribe whose work—as squarely as George Orwell's—speaks directly to ours."[^243] In June 2019, Baldwin's residence on the Upper West Side was given landmark designation by New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission.[^244][^245] In June 2019, Baldwin was one of the inaugural fifty American "pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes" inducted on the [National LGBTQ Wall of Honor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_LGBTQ_Wall_of_Honor "National LGBTQ Wall of Honor") within the [Stonewall National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_National_Monument "Stonewall National Monument") (SNM) in [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City")'s [Stonewall Inn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Inn "Stonewall Inn").[^:23-246][^sdgln-247] The SNM is the first [U.S. national monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._national_monument "U.S. national monument") dedicated to [LGBTQ rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States "LGBT rights in the United States") and [history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_LGBT_people "History of LGBT people"),[^248] and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the [50th anniversary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_50_%E2%80%93_WorldPride_NYC_2019 "Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019") of the [Stonewall riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots "Stonewall riots").[^249] At the [Paris Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Council "Paris Council") of June 2019, the city of Paris voted unanimously by all political groups to name a place in the capital in honor of James Baldwin. The project was confirmed on June 19, 2019, and announced for the year 2020. In 2021, [Paris City Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_City_Hall "Paris City Hall") announced that the writer's name would be given to the first media library in the [19th arrondissement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_arrondissement "19th arrondissement"), which is scheduled to open in 2024.[^250]

On February 1, 2024, [Google](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") celebrated James Baldwin with a [Google Doodle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle "Google Doodle"). In 2024, he appeared as a character in the television series *[Feud: Capote vs. The Swans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud:_Capote_vs._The_Swans "Feud: Capote vs. The Swans")*, played by [Chris Chalk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chalk "Chris Chalk").

On May 17, 2024, a blue plaque was unveiled by [Nubian Jak Community Trust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_Jak_Community_Trust "Nubian Jak Community Trust")/Black History Walks to honour Baldwin at the site where in 1985 he visited the [C. L. R. James](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James "C. L. R. James") Library in the [London Borough of Hackney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Hackney "London Borough of Hackney").[^251][^252] On August 2, 2024, The New York Public Library's [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schomburg_Center_for_Research_in_Black_Culture "Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture") opened an exhibition, "JIMMY! God's Black Revolutionary Mouth" in honor of the centennial of Baldwin's birth.[^253] Scheduled to run until February 28, 2025, it is accompanied by a series of public events and an exhibition of some of his manuscripts in a related exhibition "James Baldwin: Mountain to Fire" as part of the Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library's Treasures.[^254]
