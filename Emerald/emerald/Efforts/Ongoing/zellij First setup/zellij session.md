A concept from [[Zellij]].

Stores all your work in a state just how you left it.

Zellij can easily start your session back up.

It will also keep all of the application state as well, see [[#app state]] for more

## app state

Zellij will store the state of each application too, allowing you to continue working right where you stopped the last time.

In addition, you also have the option to `drop back` to the shell which will terminate the app process.
