## Details
Brave New World is Aldous Huxley‚Äôs dystopian novel. Borrowing from The Tempest , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Huxley</mark> imagines a `genetically-engineered` **future** where<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> life is pain-free but meaningless</mark>. The book heavily influenced George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 and science-fiction in general. The novel examines a futuristic society, called the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">World State</mark>, that revolves around **science and efficiency**. In this society, emotions and individuality are conditioned out of children at a young age, and there are no lasting relationships because ‚Äúevery one belongs to every one else‚Äù (a common World State dictum). Huxley begins the novel by thoroughly explaining the scientific and compartmentalized nature of this society, beginning at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where children are created outside the womb and cloned in order to increase the population. The reader is then introduced to the class system of this world, where citizens are sorted as embryos to be of a certain class. The embryos, which exist within tubes and incubators, are provided with differing amounts of chemicals and hormones in order to condition them into predetermined classes. Embryos destined for the higher classes get chemicals to perfect them both physically and mentally, whereas those of the lower classes are altered to be imperfect in those respects. These classes, in order from highest to lowest, are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. The Alphas are bred to be leaders, and the Epsilons are bred to be menial labourers.
