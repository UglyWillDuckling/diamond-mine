**Morocco**,[^4] officially the **Kingdom of Morocco**,[^5] is a country in the [Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb "Maghreb") region of [North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa"). It has coastlines on the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") to the north and the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") to the west, and has land borders with [Algeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria") to [the east](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria%E2%80%93Morocco_border "Algeria–Morocco border"), and the disputed territory of [Western Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara "Western Sahara") to [the south](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco%E2%80%93Western_Sahara_border "Morocco–Western Sahara border"), occupied by Morocco since 1975. Morocco also claims the [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") [exclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave "Enclave and exclave") of [Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta"), [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla") and [Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1%C3%B3n_de_V%C3%A9lez_de_la_Gomera "Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera"), and several small [Spanish-controlled islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plazas_de_soberan%C3%ADa "Plazas de soberanía") off its coast.[^26] It has a population of approximately 37 million. Islam is both the official and predominant religion, while Arabic and Berber are the official languages. Additionally, French and the Moroccan dialect of Arabic are widely spoken. The [culture of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Morocco "Culture of Morocco") is a mix of [Arab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_culture "Arab culture"), [Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers"), [African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Africa "Culture of Africa") and [European](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Europe "Culture of Europe") cultures. Its capital is [Rabat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat "Rabat"), while its largest city is [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca").[^27]

The region constituting Morocco has been inhabited since the [Paleolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic "Paleolithic") era over 300,000 years ago. The [Idrisid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrisid_dynasty "Idrisid dynasty") was established by [Idris I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_I_of_Morocco "Idris I of Morocco") in 788, and Morocco was subsequently ruled by a series of other independent dynasties, reaching its zenith as a [regional power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power "Regional power") in the 11th and 12th centuries, under the [Almoravid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty") and [Almohad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate "Almohad Caliphate") dynasties, when it controlled most of the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula") and the Maghreb.[^28] Centuries of [Arab migration to the Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migration_to_the_Maghreb "Arab migration to the Maghreb") since the 7th century shifted the demographic scope of the region. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Morocco faced external threats to its sovereignty, with [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire") seizing some territory and the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") encroaching from the east. The [Marinid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinid_Sultanate "Marinid Sultanate") and [Saadi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Sultanate "Saadi Sultanate") dynasties otherwise resisted foreign domination, and Morocco was the only North African nation to escape Ottoman dominion. The ['Alawi dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Alawi_dynasty "'Alawi dynasty"), which rules the country to this day, seized power in 1631, and over the next two centuries expanded [diplomatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic "Diplomatic") and commercial relations with the [Western world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"). Morocco's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean drew renewed European interest. In 1912, France and Spain divided the country into [respective protectorates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#French_and_Spanish_protectorates), reserving an [international zone in Tangier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier_International_Zone "Tangier International Zone"). Following intermittent riots and revolts against colonial rule, in 1956, Morocco regained its independence and reunified.

Since independence, Morocco has remained relatively stable. It has the [fifth-largest economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\) "List of African countries by GDP (nominal)") in Africa and wields significant influence in both Africa and the [Arab world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world"); it is considered a [middle power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_power "Middle power") in global affairs and holds membership in the [Arab League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League"), the [Arab Maghreb Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Maghreb_Union "Arab Maghreb Union"), the [Union for the Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean "Union for the Mediterranean"), and the [African Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union "African Union").[^29] Morocco is a [unitary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state "Unitary state") semi- [constitutional monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy") with an elected parliament. The [executive branch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_\(government\) "Executive (government)") is led by the [King of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Morocco "King of Morocco") and the [prime minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Morocco "Prime Minister of Morocco"), while [legislative power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature "Legislature") is vested in the two chambers of parliament: the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_\(Morocco\) "House of Representatives (Morocco)") and the [House of Councillors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Councillors_\(Morocco\) "House of Councillors (Morocco)"). Judicial power rests with the Constitutional Court, which may review the validity of laws, elections, and referendums.[^30] The king holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the [military](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Armed_Forces "Royal Moroccan Armed Forces"), foreign policy and religious affairs; he can issue [*dahirs*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Dahir "Moroccan Dahir"), decrees which have the force of law, and he can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the [prime minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_government_of_Morocco "List of heads of government of Morocco") and the president of the constitutional court.

Morocco claims ownership of the [non-self-governing territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories "United Nations list of non-self-governing territories") of [Western Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara "Western Sahara"), which it has designated its [Southern Provinces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Provinces "Southern Provinces"). In 1975, after Spain [agreed to decolonise the territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Accords "Madrid Accords") and cede its control to Morocco and [Mauritania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania "Mauritania"), a [guerrilla war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_War "Western Sahara War") broke out between those powers and some of the [local inhabitants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_people "Sahrawi people"). In 1979, Mauritania relinquished [its claim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiris_al-Gharbiyya "Tiris al-Gharbiyya") to the area, but the war continued to rage. In 1991, a ceasefire agreement was reached, but the issue of sovereignty remained unresolved. Today, Morocco occupies two-thirds of the territory, and [efforts to resolve the dispute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_peace_process "Western Sahara peace process") have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.

The [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") *Morocco* is an [anglicisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation "Anglicisation") of the [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language") name for the country, *Marruecos*, derived from the name of the city of [Marrakesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh "Marrakesh"), which was the capital of the [Almoravid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty"), the [Almohad Caliphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate "Almohad Caliphate"), and the [Saadian dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadian_dynasty "Saadian dynasty").[^31] During the Almoravid dynasty, the city of Marrakesh was established under the name of *Tāmurākušt*, derived from the city's ancient [Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages "Berber languages") name of *amūr n Yakuš* (lit.' land/country of God ').[^32] In English, the first vowel has been changed, likely influenced by the word "Moor".[^33]

Historically, the territory has been part of what Muslim geographers referred to as *[al-Maghrib al-Aqṣā](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Maghrib_al-Aq%E1%B9%A3%C4%81&action=edit&redlink=1 "Al-Maghrib al-Aqṣā (page does not exist)")* (المغرب الأقصى, 'the Farthest West \[of the Islamic world\]' designating roughly the area from [Tiaret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiaret "Tiaret") to the [Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean")) in contrast with neighbouring regions of *[al-Maghrib al-Awsaṭ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Maghrib_al-Awsa%E1%B9%AD&action=edit&redlink=1 "Al-Maghrib al-Awsaṭ (page does not exist)")* (المغرب الأوسط, 'the Middle West': [Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya") to [Béjaïa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ja%C3%AFa "Béjaïa")) and *[al-Maghrib al-Adnā](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Maghrib_al-Adn%C4%81&action=edit&redlink=1 "Al-Maghrib al-Adnā (page does not exist)")* (المغرب الأدنى, 'the Nearest West': [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria") to [Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya")).[^34]

Morocco's modern [Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") name is *al-Maghrib* (المغرب, transl. the land of the sunset; the west), with the Kingdom's official Arabic name being *al-Mamlakah al-Maghribīyah* (المملكة المغربية; transl. the kingdom of sunset/the west).[^35] [^36] [^37] In [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"), Morocco is known as *Fas*, a name derived from its medieval capital of [Fes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fes "Fes") which is derived from the Arabic word *Faʾs* (فأس; transl.[pickaxe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe")), as the city's founder [Idris I ibn Abd Allah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_I_of_Morocco "Idris I of Morocco") reputedly used a silver and gold pickaxe to trace the outlines of the city.[^38] [^39] In other parts of the Islamic world, for example in Egyptian and Middle Eastern Arabic literature before the mid-20th century, Morocco was commonly referred to as *Murrakush* (مراكش).[^40] The term is still used to refer to Morocco today in several [Indo-Iranian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages "Indo-Iranian languages") languages, including [Persian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language"), [Urdu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu "Urdu"), and [Punjabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language "Punjabi language").[^41]

Morocco has also been referred to politically by a variety of terms denoting the [Sharifi heritage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharifism "Sharifism") of the ' [Alawi dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alawi_dynasty "Alawi dynasty"), such as *al-Mamlakah ash-Sharīfah* (المملكة الشريفة), *al-Iyālah ash-Sharīfah* (الإيالة الشريفة) and *al-Imbarāṭūriyyah ash-Sharīfah* (الإمبراطورية الشريفة), rendered in French as *l'Empire chérifien* and in English as the 'Sharifian Empire'.[^42] [^43]

## History

The area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least [Paleolithic times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic "Paleolithic"), beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC.[^44] A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: *[Homo sapiens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens "Homo sapiens")* fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the [Atlantic coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") in [Jebel Irhoud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud "Jebel Irhoud") were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago.[^45] During the [Upper Paleolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic "Upper Paleolithic"), the [Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb "Maghreb") was more fertile than it is today, resembling a [savanna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna "Savanna"), in contrast to its modern arid landscape.[^46]

DNA studies of [Iberomaurusian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberomaurusian "Iberomaurusian") peoples at [Taforalt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taforalt "Taforalt"), Morocco dating to around 15,000 years ago have found them to have a distinctive Maghrebi ancestry formed from a mixture of [Near Eastern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East "Near East") and African ancestry, which is still found as a part of the genome of modern Northwest Africans.[^47] Later during the [Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic"), from around 7,500 years ago onwards, there was a migration into Northwest Africa of [European Neolithic Farmers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_European_Farmers "Early European Farmers") from the Iberian Peninsula (who had originated in [Anatolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") several thousand years prior), as well as pastoralists from the [Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant"), both of whom also significantly contributed to the ancestry of modern Northwest Africans.[^48] The [proto-Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Berber_language "Proto-Berber language") tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late [Bronze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") - and early [Iron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age "Iron Age") ages.[^49]

In the early part of [Classical Antiquity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity "Classical Antiquity"), Northwest Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean") world by the [Phoenicians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicians "Phoenicians"), who established trading colonies and settlements there, the most substantial of which were [Chellah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chellah "Chellah"), [Lixus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lixus_\(ancient_city\) "Lixus (ancient city)"), and [Mogador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogador "Mogador").[^50] Mogador was established as a Phoenician colony as early as the 6th century BC.[^51]

Roman ruins of [Volubilis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volubilis "Volubilis")

Morocco later became a realm of the Northwest African civilisation of [ancient Carthage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage "Ancient Carthage"), and part of the Carthaginian empire. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the [Berber kingdom of Mauretania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania "Mauretania"), under King [Baga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baga_\(king\) "Baga (king)").[^52] This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the modern state of [Mauritania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania "Mauritania")) flourished around 225 BC or earlier. [Mauretania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania "Mauretania") became a [client](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state "Client state") kingdom of the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") in 33 BC. Emperor [Claudius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius "Claudius") annexed Mauretania directly in 44 AD, making it a [Roman province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province "Roman province") ruled by an imperial [governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor "Governor") (either a *procurator Augusti*, or a *legatus Augusti pro praetore*).

[Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") in Morocco appeared during the [Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") times, when it was practiced by [Berber Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_Christians "Berber Christians") in Roman [Mauretania Tingitana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania_Tingitana "Mauretania Tingitana").[^53] During the [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century "Crisis of the Third Century"), parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berbers. By the late 3rd century, direct Roman rule had become confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta")) in [Mauretania Tingitana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania_Tingitana "Mauretania Tingitana") and [Cherchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchell "Cherchell") in [Mauretania Caesariensis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania_Caesariensis "Mauretania Caesariensis"). When, in 429 AD, the area was devastated by the [Vandals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals "Vandals"), the Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania, and local [Mauro-Roman kings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro-Roman_kingdom "Mauro-Roman kingdom") assumed control of them. In the 530s, the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire"), under Byzantine control, re-established direct imperial rule of Septum and [Tingi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingi "Tingi"), fortified Tingis and erected a church.

The [Muslim conquest of the Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Maghreb "Muslim conquest of the Maghreb") that had begun during the mid-7th century was completed under the [Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate") by 709. The caliphate introduced both [Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") and the Arabic language to the area; this period also saw the beginning of a trend of [Arab migration to the Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migration_to_the_Maghreb "Arab migration to the Maghreb") which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region. While constituting part of the larger empire, Morocco was initially organised as a subsidiary province of [Ifriqiya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifriqiya "Ifriqiya"), with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in [Kairouan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairouan "Kairouan").[^54]

The indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their [customary laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law "Customary law"). They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration.[^55] The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the [Kingdom of Nekor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nekor "Kingdom of Nekor"), an emirate in the [Rif Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif_Mountains "Rif Mountains"). It was founded by [Salih I ibn Mansur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salih_I_ibn_Mansur "Salih I ibn Mansur") in 710, as a client state to the Umayyad Caliphate. After the outbreak of the [Berber Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_Revolt "Berber Revolt") in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the [Miknasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miknasa "Miknasa") of [Sijilmasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijilmasa "Sijilmasa") and the [Barghawata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barghawata "Barghawata").

[al-Qarawiyyin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_al-Qarawiyyin "University of al-Qarawiyyin"), founded in [Fes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez,_Morocco "Fez, Morocco") in the 9th century, was a major spiritual, literary, and intellectual centre.

The founder of the [Idrisid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrisid_dynasty "Idrisid dynasty") and the great-grandson of [Hasan ibn Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_ibn_Ali "Hasan ibn Ali"), [Idris ibn Abdallah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_ibn_Abdallah "Idris ibn Abdallah"), had fled to Morocco after the massacre of his family by the [Abbasids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate") in the [Hejaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz"). He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs and he founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788. The Idrisids established [Fes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fes,_Morocco "Fes, Morocco") as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major [regional power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power "Regional power"). The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the [Fatimid Caliphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate "Fatimid Caliphate") and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the [Maghrawa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrawa "Maghrawa") of Sijilmasa in 980.

The empire of the [Almohad dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_dynasty "Almohad dynasty") at its greatest extent, c. 1212

From the 11th century onward, a series of Berber dynasties arose.[^56] [^57] [^58] Under the [Sanhaja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhaja "Sanhaja") [Almoravid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty") and the [Masmuda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masmuda "Masmuda") [Almohad dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_dynasty "Almohad dynasty"),[^59] Morocco dominated the Maghreb, [al-Andalus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") in [Iberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia "Iberia"), and the western Mediterranean region. From the 13th century onward the country saw a [massive migration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migration_to_the_Maghreb "Arab migration to the Maghreb") of the [Banu Hilal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hilal "Banu Hilal") Arab tribes. In the 13th and 14th centuries the [Zenata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenata "Zenata") Berber [Marinids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinids "Marinids") held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the Almohads through military campaigns in Algeria and Spain. They were followed by the [Wattasids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattasids "Wattasids"). In the 15th century, the [Reconquista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista "Reconquista") ended Muslim rule in Iberia and many Muslims and [Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Morocco "History of the Jews in Morocco") fled to Morocco.[^60] [Portuguese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") efforts to control the Atlantic sea trade in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco even though they managed to control some possessions on the Moroccan coast but not venturing further afield inland.

The [Portuguese Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire") was founded when [Prince Henry the Navigator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Henry_the_Navigator "Prince Henry the Navigator") led the [conquest of Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Ceuta "Conquest of Ceuta"), which began the Portuguese presence in Morocco, lasting from 1415 to 1769.

In 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the Islamic prophet [Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad"): first the [Saadi dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_dynasty "Saadi dynasty") who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the [Alawi dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alawi_dynasty "Alawi dynasty"), who have remained in power since the 17th century. Morocco faced aggression from [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") in the north, and the Ottoman Empire's allies pressing westward.

The remains of the Saadi sultan [Ahmad al-Mansur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_al-Mansur "Ahmad al-Mansur") 's 16th century [Badi' Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badi%27_Palace "Badi' Palace")

Under the Saadis, the sultanate [ended the Portuguese Aviz dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_succession_crisis_of_1580 "Portuguese succession crisis of 1580") in 1578 at the [Battle of Alcácer Quibir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alc%C3%A1cer_Quibir "Battle of Alcácer Quibir"). The reign of [Ahmad al-Mansur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_al-Mansur "Ahmad al-Mansur") brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a [large expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadian_invasion_of_the_Songhai_Empire "Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire") to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the [Songhay Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songhay_Empire "Songhay Empire") in 1591. However, managing the territories across the [Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara") proved too difficult.[^61] Upon the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.

After a period of political fragmentation and conflict during the decline of the Saadi dynasty, Morocco was finally reunited by the Alawi sultan [al-Rashid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Rashid_of_Morocco "Al-Rashid of Morocco") in the late 1660s, who took Fez in 1666 and Marrakesh in 1668.[^27]<sup><span title="Page / location: 230">: 230 </span></sup>  [^62]<sup><span title="Page / location: 225">: 225 </span></sup>  The 'Alawis succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy. Against the opposition of local tribes [Ismail Ibn Sharif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ibn_Sharif "Ismail Ibn Sharif") (1672–1727) began to create a unified state.[^63] With his [Riffian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif "Rif") army, he re-occupied [Tangier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Tangier "English Tangier") from the English who had abandoned it in 1684 and drove the Spanish from [Larache](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larache "Larache") in 1689. The Portuguese abandoned [Mazagão](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazagan "Mazagan"), their last territory in Morocco, in 1769. However, the [siege of Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Melilla_\(1774\) "Siege of Melilla (1774)") against the Spanish ended in defeat in 1775.

Morocco was the first nation to recognise the fledgling United States as an independent nation in 1777.[^64] [^65] [^66] In the beginning of the [American Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution"), American merchant ships in the Atlantic Ocean were subject to attacks by other fleets. On 20 December 1777, Morocco's Sultan [Mohammed III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_ben_Abdallah "Mohammed ben Abdallah") declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage. The 1786 [Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan%E2%80%93American_Treaty_of_Friendship "Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship") stands as the United States' oldest unbroken friendship treaty.[^67] [^68]

The [Treaty of Wad Ras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Wad_Ras "Treaty of Wad Ras") after the [Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–1860)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispano-Moroccan_War_\(1859%E2%80%931860\) "Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–1860)") bankrupted Morocco's national treasury, forcing the [Makhzen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhzen "Makhzen") to take on a British loan [^69]

As Europe industrialised, Northwest Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory, but also because of the strategic position of Morocco with coasts on the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic.[^70] In 1860, a dispute over Spain's Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war. Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement. In 1884, Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco.

[Tangier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier "Tangier") 's population in 1956 included 40,000 Muslims, 31,000 Europeans and 15,000 Jews.[^71]

In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the [United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") of France's [sphere of influence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence "Sphere of influence") provoked a strong reaction from the [German Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"); and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the [Algeciras Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeciras_Conference "Algeciras Conference") in 1906. The [Agadir Crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir_Crisis "Agadir Crisis") of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 [Treaty of Fez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fez "Treaty of Fez") made Morocco a [protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate "Protectorate") of France, and triggered the [1912 Fez riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Fez_riots "1912 Fez riots").[^72] Spain continued to operate its coastal protectorate. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of [protecting power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_power "Protecting power") over the northern coastal and southern [Saharan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara") zones.[^73]

Map depicting the [French conquest of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_conquest_of_Morocco "French conquest of Morocco") from 1907 to 1934

Tens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco. Some bought up large amounts of rich agricultural land, while others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco – with some Moroccan tribes allying with the French against other competing tribes from early on in its conquest. The French colonial administrator, Governor general Marshal [Hubert Lyautey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Lyautey "Hubert Lyautey"), sincerely admired Moroccan culture and succeeded in imposing a joint Moroccan-French administration, while creating a modern school system. Several divisions of Moroccan soldiers ([Goumiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goumier "Goumier") or regular troops and officers) served in the [French army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_army "French army") in both [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), and in the Spanish [Nationalist Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francoism "Francoism") in the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") and after (*[Regulares](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulares "Regulares")*).[^74] The institution of [slavery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Morocco "Slavery in Morocco") was abolished in 1925.[^75]

Between 1921 and 1926, an [uprising](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif_War "Rif War") in the [Rif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif "Rif") Mountains, led by [Abd el-Krim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ibn_%27Abd_al-Karim_al-Khattabi "Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi"), led to the establishment of the [Republic of the Rif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Rif "Republic of the Rif"). The Spanish used anti-civilian bombing raids and mustard gas to prevent the Rif republic from gaining independence.[^76] They lost more than 13,000 soldiers at [Annual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Annual "Battle of Annual") in July–August 1921 alone.[^77] The Riffi were eventually suppressed by 1927 by the Franco-Spanish military. The casualties on the Spanish-French side were 52,000 and from the Riffi 10,000 died.[^78]

The [Proclamation of Independence of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Independence_of_Morocco "Proclamation of Independence of Morocco") of 1944

In 1943, the [Istiqlal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istiqlal_Party "Istiqlal Party") (Independence Party) was founded to press for independence, with discreet US support. Moroccan nationalists drew heavily on [transnational activist networks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_the_King_and_the_People "Revolution of the King and the People") for lobbying to end colonial rule, primarily at the United Nations.[^79] The Istiqlal Party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.

King [Mohammed V](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_V_of_Morocco "Mohammed V of Morocco") during a visit to the United States in 1957

France's exile of Sultan [Mohammed V](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_V_of_Morocco "Mohammed V of Morocco") in 1953 to [Madagascar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar") and his replacement by the unpopular [Mohammed Ben Aarafa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ben_Aarafa "Mohammed Ben Aarafa") sparked active opposition to the French and Spanish protectorates.[^80] The most notable violence occurred in [Oujda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oujda "Oujda") where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets.[^81] France allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.[^82] In March 1956 Morocco regained its independence from France as the Kingdom of Morocco. A month later Spain forsook its protectorate in Northern Morocco to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves ([Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta") and [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla")) on the Mediterranean coast which dated from earlier conquests, but over which Morocco still claims [sovereignty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty") to this day.

### Post-independence

Sultan Mohammed became King in 1957. Upon the death of Mohammed V, [Hassan II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II_of_Morocco "Hassan II of Morocco") became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961. Morocco held its first [general elections in 1963](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_parliamentary_election,_1963 "Moroccan parliamentary election, 1963"). However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971 and 1972, there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.

In 1963, the [Sand War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_War "Sand War") was fought between Algerian and Moroccan troops over Moroccan claims to parts of Algerian territory. A formal peace agreement was signed in February 1964; however, relations remained strained between the two countries following the conflict.[^83] The Spanish [enclave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave "Enclave") of [Ifni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifni "Ifni") in the south was returned to Morocco in 1969.[^84]

The [Polisario movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario_movement "Polisario movement") was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the Spanish Sahara. On 6 November 1975, King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the Spanish Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the " [Green March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_March "Green March") ".[^85] A month later, Spain agreed to leave the Spanish Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by Algeria. Moroccan forces occupied the territory.[^60]

Moroccan and Algerian troops [soon clashed in Western Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_War "Western Sahara War"). Morocco and Mauritania divided up Western Sahara. Fighting between the Moroccan military and Polisario forces continued for many years. The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on Morocco. In 1983, Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis. In 1984, Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the [SADR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic") 's admission to the body. Polisario claimed to have killed more than 5,000 Moroccan soldiers between 1982 and 1985.[^86] Algerian authorities have estimated the number of [Sahrawi refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_refugees "Sahrawi refugees") in Algeria to be 165,000.[^87] Diplomatic relations with Algeria were restored in 1988. In 1991, a UN-monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara, but the territory's status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported. The following decade saw much wrangling over a [proposed referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Agreement "Houston Agreement") on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken.[^88]

Map of the [Western Sahara War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_War "Western Sahara War") (1975–1991)

Political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature with Morocco's first opposition-led government coming to power. King Hassan II died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son, [Mohammed VI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_VI_of_Morocco "Mohammed VI of Morocco").[^89] He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation.[^90] Mohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in 2002.[^91] Morocco unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in 2007.[^92] The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal.[^93] Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York City but failed to come to any agreement.[^94] In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital [El Aaiún](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Aai%C3%BAn "El Aaiún").[^95]

[Mohammed VI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_VI_of_Morocco "Mohammed VI of Morocco") and other world leaders and representatives attend the [Armistice Day centenary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day_centenary "Armistice Day centenary") in November 2018.

In 2002, Morocco and Spain agreed to a US-brokered resolution over the disputed island of [Perejil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perejil_Island "Perejil Island"). Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag.[^96] There were renewed tensions in 2005, as dozens of African migrants stormed the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. In response, Spain deported dozens of the illegal migrants to Morocco from Melilla.[^97] In 2006, the Spanish Premier [Zapatero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero "José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero") visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories.[^98] The following year, Spanish King [Juan Carlos I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_I "Juan Carlos I") visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.[^99]

During the [2011–2012 Moroccan protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Moroccan_protests "2011–2012 Moroccan protests"), thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a [referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Moroccan_constitutional_referendum "2011 Moroccan constitutional referendum") on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the [Arab Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring "Arab Spring") protests.[^100] In the first [general elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Moroccan_general_election "2011 Moroccan general election") that followed, the moderate Islamist [Justice and Development Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_\(Morocco\) "Justice and Development Party (Morocco)") won a plurality of seats, with [Abdelilah Benkirane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelilah_Benkirane "Abdelilah Benkirane") being designated as head of government per the new constitution.[^101] Despite the reforms made by Mohammed VI, demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.[^102]

On 24 August 2021, neighbouring Algeria cut diplomatic relations with Morocco, accusing Morocco of supporting a separatist group and hostile actions against Algeria. Morocco called the decision unjustified. Foreign Minister [Ramtane Lamamra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramtane_Lamamra "Ramtane Lamamra") accused Morocco of using [Pegasus spyware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_\(spyware\) "Pegasus (spyware)") against its officials.[^103] [Amnesty International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") found that two phones of Sahraoui human rights defender [Aminatou Haidar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminatou_Haidar "Aminatou Haidar") were infected in November 2021.[^104]

On 8 September 2023, a 6.8 magnitude [earthquake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Al_Haouz_earthquake "2023 Al Haouz earthquake") hit Morocco killing more than 2,800 people and injuring thousands. The [epicentre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenter "Epicenter") of the quake was around 70 km southwest of city of Marrakech.[^105]

On 10 December 2020, the [Israel–Morocco normalisation agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Morocco_normalization_agreement "Israel–Morocco normalization agreement") was announced, and Morocco announced its intention to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.[^106] Joint Declaration of the Kingdom of Morocco, the United States of America and the State of Israel was signed on 22 December 2020.[^107] The agreement was met with criticism due to the October 2023 [Gaza war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war"). Moroccan Foreign Minister [Nasser Bourita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Bourita "Nasser Bourita") argues that maintaining relations does not signify endorsement of Israeli government actions.[^108]

## Geography

[Toubkal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toubkal "Toubkal"), the highest peak in Northern Africa, at 4,167 m (13,671 ft)

A section of the [Anti-Atlas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Atlas "Anti-Atlas") near [Tafraout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafraout "Tafraout")

An old [Atlas cedar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrus_atlantica "Cedrus atlantica") tree in the Atlas range

Morocco has a coast by the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") that reaches past the [Strait of Gibraltar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar "Strait of Gibraltar") into the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"). It is bordered by [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") to the north (a water border through the Strait and [land borders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco%E2%80%93Spain_border "Morocco–Spain border") with three small Spanish-controlled [exclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclave "Exclave"), [Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta"), [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla") and [Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1%C3%B3n_de_V%C3%A9lez_de_la_Gomera "Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera")), [Algeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria") to the east, and [Western Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara "Western Sahara") to the south. Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its *de facto* southern boundary is with [Mauritania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania "Mauritania").[^109] The geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a [Northern African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Africa "Northern Africa") country, bordering the [North Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Ocean "North Atlantic Ocean") and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") and [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France")) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.[^110]

A large part of Morocco is mountainous. The [Atlas Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Mountains "Atlas Mountains") are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The [Rif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif "Rif") Mountains are located in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the [Berber people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people").[^111] Its total area is about 446,300 km <sup>2</sup> (172,317 sq mi). Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.[^112] The internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes [27°](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_parallel_north "27th parallel north") and 36°N, and longitudes 1° and [14°W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_meridian_west "14th meridian west"). Morocco's capital city is [Rabat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat "Rabat"), a city that is beside the [Oued Bou Regreg River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bou_Regreg "Bou Regreg"); its largest city is its main port, [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca"). Other cities recording a population over 500,000 in the [2014 Moroccan census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Moroccan_census "2014 Moroccan census") are [Fes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fes "Fes"), [Marrakesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh "Marrakesh"), [Meknes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meknes "Meknes"), [Salé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%A9 "Salé") and [Tangier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier "Tangier").[^113]

The Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the northwest to the northeast. The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country,[^114] from the northeast to the southwest. Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the [Sahara Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Desert "Sahara Desert") and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, with Morocco's largest cities encapsulated by the [Middle Atlas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Atlas "Middle Atlas") and the [High Atlas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Atlas "High Atlas") mountain range, while to the south lies the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was annexed by Morocco in 1975 during the [Green March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_March "Green March").[^6] Morocco claims that the Western Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its [Southern Provinces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Provinces "Southern Provinces").[^109]

Spanish territory in Northwest Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast: [Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta"), [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla"), [Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1%C3%B3n_de_V%C3%A9lez_de_la_Gomera "Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera"), [Peñón de Alhucemas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1%C3%B3n_de_Alhucemas "Peñón de Alhucemas"), the [Chafarinas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islas_Chafarinas "Islas Chafarinas") islands and the disputed islet [Perejil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Perejil "Isla Perejil"). Off the Atlantic coast the [Canary Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands "Canary Islands") belong to Spain, whereas [Madeira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira "Madeira") to the north is [Portuguese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal"). To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded [transit passage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_passage "Transit passage") between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.

Morocco is represented in the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2") geographical encoding standard by the symbol *MA*.[^115] This code was used as the basis for Morocco's internet domain, [.ma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ma ".ma").[^115]

### Climate

[Köppen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") climate types in Morocco

In area, Morocco's climate is mainly " [hot summer Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate#Hot-summer_Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate") " (*Csa*) and " [hot desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_desert_climate "Hot desert climate") " (*BWh*) zones.[^116]

Central mountain ranges and the effects of the cold [Canary Current](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Current "Canary Current"), off the [Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic "Atlantic") coast, are significant factors in Morocco's relatively large variety of vegetation zones, ranging from lush forests in the northern and central mountains, giving way to steppe, semi-arid and desert areas in the eastern and southern regions. The Moroccan coastal plains experience moderate temperatures even in summer.[^117]

In the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree [endemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism "Endemism") to Morocco.[^118] In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.[^117]

Southeast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeasternmost portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the [Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara") desert, where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush [oases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis "Oasis").[^119]

In contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal [plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain "Plain") are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes Morocco a country of contrasts. [Forested areas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest "Forest") cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.[^120]

Landscape of the [Erg Chebbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_Chebbi "Erg Chebbi")

[Atlas Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Mountains "Atlas Mountains")

In general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus Morocco has the following climate zones:

- **Mediterranean:** Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500 km strip), and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs are between 29 °C (84.2 °F) and 32 °C (89.6 °F). Winters are generally mild and wet, daily average temperatures hover around 9 °C (48.2 °F) to 11 °C (51.8 °F), and average low are around 5 °C (41.0 °F) to 8 °C (46.4 °F), typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean. Annual Precipitation in this area varies from 600 to 800 mm in the west to 350–500 mm in the east. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [Tangier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier "Tangier"), [Tetouan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetouan "Tetouan"), [Al Hoceima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hoceima "Al Hoceima"), [Nador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nador "Nador") and [Safi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safi,_Morocco "Safi, Morocco").
- **Sub-Mediterranean:** It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean. There are thus two main influencing climates:

- *Oceanic:* Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around 27 °C (80.6 °F) and in terms of the Essaouira region, are almost always around 21 °C (69.8 °F). The medium daily temperatures can get as low as 19 °C (66.2 °F), while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700 mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [Rabat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat "Rabat"), [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca"), [Kénitra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A9nitra "Kénitra"), [Salé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%A9 "Salé") and [Essaouira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essaouira "Essaouira").[^119]

- *Continental:* Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as 40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F). However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below 20 °C (68.0 °F), and sometimes as low as 10 °C (50.0 °F) in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also, snow can fall occasionally. Fès for example registered −8 °C (17.6 °F) in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900 mm. Notable cities are [Fès](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A8s "Fès"), [Meknès](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekn%C3%A8s "Meknès"), [Chefchaouen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chefchaouen "Chefchaouen"), [Beni-Mellal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beni-Mellal "Beni-Mellal") and [Taza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taza "Taza").[^119]

- **Continental:** Dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where summers are hot to very hot, with highs between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F). Winters on the other hand are cold, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. And when cold damp air comes to Morocco from the northwest, for a few days, temperatures sometimes get below −5 °C (23.0 °F). It often snows abundantly in this part of the country. Precipitation varies between 400 and 800 mm. Notable cities are [Khenifra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khenifra "Khenifra"), [Imilchil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imilchil "Imilchil"), [Midelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midelt "Midelt") and [Azilal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azilal "Azilal").
- **Alpine:** Found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200 mm. In summer highs barely go above 30 °C (86.0 °F), and lows are cool and average below 15 °C (59.0 °F). In winters, highs average around 8 °C (46.4 °F), and lows go well below the freezing point. In this part of the country, there are many ski resorts, such as [Oukaimeden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouka%C3%AFmeden "Oukaïmeden") and Mischliefen. Notable cities are [Ifrane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrane "Ifrane"), [Azrou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrou "Azrou") and [Boulmane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulmane "Boulmane").
- **Semi-arid:** This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350 mm. However, one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes. Notable cities are [Agadir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir "Agadir"), [Marrakesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh "Marrakesh") and [Oujda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oujda "Oujda").[^119]

South of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.

Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7–8 degrees Celsius when [sirocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirocco "Sirocco") blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7–8 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena do not last for more than two to five days on average.[^121]

[Climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Morocco "Climate change in Morocco") is expected to significantly impact Morocco on multiple dimensions. As a coastal country with hot and arid climates, environmental impacts are likely to be wide and varied. As of the 2019 [Climate Change Performance Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Performance_Index "Climate Change Performance Index"), Morocco was ranked second in [preparedness behind Sweden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Sweden "Climate change in Sweden").[^122]

### Biodiversity

The [Caracal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal "Caracal")

Morocco has a wide range of [biodiversity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity"). It is part of the [Mediterranean basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin "Mediterranean Basin"), an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss, and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority.[^123] [Avifauna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird "Bird") are notably variant.[^124] The avifauna of Morocco includes a total of 454 species, five of which have been [introduced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species "Introduced species") by humans, and 156 are rarely or accidentally seen.[^125] Morocco is home to six terrestrial ecoregions: [Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_conifer_and_mixed_forests "Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests"), [Mediterranean High Atlas juniper steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_High_Atlas_juniper_steppe "Mediterranean High Atlas juniper steppe"), [Mediterranean acacia-argania dry woodlands and succulent thickets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_acacia-argania_dry_woodlands_and_succulent_thickets "Mediterranean acacia-argania dry woodlands and succulent thickets"), [Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_dry_woodlands_and_steppe "Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe"), [Mediterranean woodlands and forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_woodlands_and_forests "Mediterranean woodlands and forests") and [North Saharan steppe and woodlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Saharan_steppe_and_woodlands "North Saharan steppe and woodlands").[^126]

The [Barbary lion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_lion "Barbary lion"), hunted to extinction in the wild, was a subspecies native to Morocco and is a national emblem.[^9] The last Barbary lion in the wild was shot in the Atlas Mountains in 1922.[^127] The other two primary predators of northern Africa, the [Atlas bear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_bear "Atlas bear") and [Barbary leopard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_leopard "Barbary leopard"), are now extinct and critically endangered, respectively. Relic populations of the [West African crocodile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_crocodile "West African crocodile") persisted in the [Draa river](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draa_river "Draa river") until the 20th century.[^128] The Barbary macaque, a primate endemic to Morocco and Algeria, is also facing extinction due to offtake for trade [^129] human interruption, urbanisation, wood and real estate expansion that diminish forested area—the macaque's habitat.

Trade of animals and plants for food, pets, medicinal purposes, souvenirs and photo props is common across Morocco, despite laws making much of it illegal.[^130] [^131] This trade is unregulated and causing unknown reductions of wild populations of native Moroccan wildlife. Because of the proximity of northern Morocco to Europe, species such as cacti, tortoises, mammal skins, and high-value birds (falcons and bustards) are harvested in various parts of the country and exported in appreciable quantities, with especially large volumes of eel harvested – 60 tons exported to the Far East in the period 2009‒2011.[^132]

The [King of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Morocco "King of Morocco"), [Mohammed VI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_VI_of_Morocco "Mohammed VI of Morocco")

According to the 2022 *[Economist Democracy Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_Democracy_Index "The Economist Democracy Index")*, Morocco is ruled under a [hybrid regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_regime "Hybrid regime"), scoring #3 in the [Middle East and North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA "MENA"), and #95 in the world.[^133] Morocco has a "difficult" ranking on the 2023 *[World Press Freedom Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index "World Press Freedom Index")*.[^134]

Following the March 1998 elections, a coalition government headed by opposition [socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") leader [Abderrahmane Youssoufi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abderrahmane_Youssoufi "Abderrahmane Youssoufi") and composed largely of ministers drawn from opposition parties, was formed. Prime Minister Youssoufi's government was the first ever government drawn primarily from opposition parties, and also represents the first opportunity for a coalition of socialists, left-of-centre, and nationalist parties to be included in the government until October 2002. It was also the first time in the modern political history of the Arab world that the opposition assumed power following an election. The current government is headed by [Aziz Akhannouch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aziz_Akhannouch "Aziz Akhannouch").

The [Constitution of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Morocco "Constitution of Morocco") provides for a monarchy with a [Parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Morocco "Parliament of Morocco") and an independent [judiciary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary "Judiciary"). With the [2011 constitutional reforms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_constitutional_referendum,_2011 "Moroccan constitutional referendum, 2011"), the King of Morocco retains less executive powers whereas those of the prime minister have been enlarged.[^135] [^136] The constitution grants the king honorific powers (among other powers); he is both the secular political leader and the " [Commander of the Faithful](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_al-Mu%27minin "Amir al-Mu'minin") " as a direct descendant of the Prophet [Mohammed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed "Mohammed"). He presides over the Council of Ministers; appoints the Prime Minister from the political party that has won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, and on recommendations from the latter, appoints the members of the government.

The constitution of 1996 theoretically allowed the king to terminate the tenure of any minister, and after consultation with the heads of the higher and lower Assemblies, to dissolve the Parliament, suspend the constitution, call for new elections, or rule by decree. The only time this happened was in 1965. The King is formally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

### Legislative branch

The legislature's building in Rabat

Since the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The [Assembly of Representatives of Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Representatives_of_Morocco "Assembly of Representatives of Morocco") (*Majlis an-Nuwwâb/Assemblée des Répresentants*) has 395 members elected for a five-year term, 305 elected in multi-seat [constituencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituency "Constituency") and 90 in national lists consisting of women and youth.

The [Assembly of Councillors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Councillors "Assembly of Councillors") (*Majlis al-Mustasharin*) has 120 members, elected for a six-year term. 72 members are elected at the regional level, 20 members are elected from trade unions, 8 seats from professional organisations and 20 from wage-earners.[^137]

The Parliament's powers, though still relatively limited, were expanded under the 1992 and 1996 and even further in the 2011 constitutional revisions and include [budgetary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget "Budget") matters, approving [bills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_\(proposed_law\) "Bill (proposed law)"), questioning ministers, and establishing ad hoc commissions of inquiry to investigate the government's actions. The lower chamber of Parliament may dissolve the government through a [vote of no confidence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_of_no_confidence "Vote of no confidence").[^138] [^139] [^140]

The latest parliamentary elections were held on [8 September 2021](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Moroccan_general_election "2021 Moroccan general election"). Voter turnout in these elections was estimated to be 50.35% of registered voters.[^141] [^142]

### Administrative divisions

The administrative regions of Morocco

Morocco is officially divided into 12 [regions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Morocco "Regions of Morocco"),[^143] which, in turn, are subdivided into [62 provinces and 13 prefectures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_and_provinces_of_Morocco "Prefectures and provinces of Morocco").[^144]

### Foreign relations

Morocco is a member of the [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") and belongs to the [African Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union "African Union") (AU), [Arab League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League"), [Arab Maghreb Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Maghreb_Union "Arab Maghreb Union") (UMA), [Organisation of Islamic Cooperation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation "Organisation of Islamic Cooperation") (OIC), the [Non-Aligned Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement") and the [Community of Sahel–Saharan States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Sahel%E2%80%93Saharan_States "Community of Sahel–Saharan States") (CEN–SAD). Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab and Western states. Morocco has had strong ties to the West in order to gain economic and political benefits.[^145] France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco. From the total foreign investments in Morocco, the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") invests approximately 73.5%, whereas the Arab world invests only 19.3%. Many countries from the [Persian Gulf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf "Arab states of the Persian Gulf") and [Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb "Maghreb") regions are getting more involved in large-scale development projects in Morocco.[^146]

Morocco claims sovereignty over Spanish enclaves of [Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta") and [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla").

In 2002, a [dispute with Spain over the small island of Perejil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perejil_Island_crisis "Perejil Island crisis") arose, which brought attention to the issue of the sovereignty of [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla") and [Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta").[^147] These small enclaves on the Mediterranean coast are surrounded by Morocco and have been under Spanish administration for centuries.

In 2004, the [George W. Bush administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_administration "George W. Bush administration") granted Morocco the status of [major non-NATO ally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_non-NATO_ally "Major non-NATO ally").[^148] Morocco was the first country in the world to recognise US sovereignty, in 1777. After gaining independence, [Morocco established strong ties with the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco%E2%80%93United_States_relations "Morocco–United States relations"), receiving significant economic and military aid.[^79] This partnership flourished during the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), with Morocco becoming a key ally against communist expansion in [North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa"). In return, the US supported Morocco's territorial ambitions and efforts to modernise its economy. Morocco received more than $400 million in American aid between 1957 and 1963, which elevated it to the fifth-largest recipient of US agricultural assistance by 1966. The long-lasting relationship between the two nations has endured, with the US remaining one of Morocco's top allies. Additionally, Morocco is included in the European Union's [European Neighbourhood Policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy "European Neighbourhood Policy") (ENP), which aims at bringing the [EU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") and its neighbours closer.[^149]

Morocco's membership in the [African Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union "African Union") has been marked by significant events. In 1984, Morocco withdrew from the organisation after it admitted the [Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic") in 1982 without conducting a referendum of self-determination in the disputed territory of Western Sahara.[^150] [^151] This decision was made unilaterally by Morocco. However, in 2017, Morocco rejoined the AU, signaling a shift in its diplomatic stance. In November 2020, [Brahim Ghali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahim_Ghali "Brahim Ghali"), leader of the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi president, unilaterally ended a 29-year-old ceasefire agreement with Morocco overseen by the United Nations.[^152] In December 2020, Morocco had started to pursue military cooperation with Israel from a normalization agreement. Algeria backs the Polisario Front of Morocco's breakaway state, the [Western Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara "Western Sahara").[^153] In August 2021, Algeria severed diplomatic relations with Morocco.[^154] Algerian authorities have accused Rabat of supporting the [Movement for the Self-Determination of Kabylie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_the_Self-Determination_of_Kabylie "Movement for the Self-Determination of Kabylie") (MAK), which it classifies as a terrorist organisation.[^154]

Morocco annexed Western Sahara in 1975. The [Polisario Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario_Front "Polisario Front") control the territory east of the [Moroccan *berm* (wall)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Wall "Moroccan Wall").

The status of the [Saguia el-Hamra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saguia_el-Hamra "Saguia el-Hamra") and [Río de Oro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_de_Oro "Río de Oro") regions is disputed. The [Western Sahara War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_War "Western Sahara War") saw the [Polisario Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario_Front "Polisario Front"), the Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement, battling both Morocco and Mauritania between 1976 and a ceasefire in 1991. The Moroccan government has stated that their claimed area of Western Sahara is referred to as the "Southern Provinces".[^155] A United Nations mission, [MINURSO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINURSO "MINURSO"), is tasked with organising a referendum on whether the territory should become independent or recognised as a part of Morocco.

Part of the territory, the [Free Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Zone_\(Western_Sahara_region\) "Free Zone (Western Sahara region)"), is a mostly uninhabited area that the Polisario Front controls as the [Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic"). Its administrative headquarters are located in [Tindouf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tindouf "Tindouf"), Algeria. As of 2006, no [UN member state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_United_Nations "Member state of the United Nations") had recognised Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.[^156] In 2006, the government of Morocco suggested [autonomous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy_for_Western_Sahara "Autonomy for Western Sahara") status for the region through the Moroccan [Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Advisory_Council_for_Saharan_Affairs "Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs") (CORCAS). The project was presented to the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council") in mid-April 2007. The proposal was encouraged by Moroccan allies such as the United States, France, and Spain.[^157] The Security Council has called upon the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.[^158]

In 2020, the United States under the [Trump administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump "First presidency of Donald Trump") became the first Western country to back Morocco's contested sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara region, on the agreement that Morocco would simultaneously normalise [relations with Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Morocco_relations "Israel–Morocco relations").[^159]

### Military

*Mohammed VI*, a [FREMM multipurpose frigate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FREMM_multipurpose_frigate "FREMM multipurpose frigate") of the [Royal Moroccan Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Navy "Royal Moroccan Navy")

Morocco's military consists of the Royal Armed Forces—this includes the [Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Army "Royal Moroccan Army") (the largest branch), the [Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Navy "Royal Moroccan Navy"), the [Air Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Air_Force "Royal Moroccan Air Force"), the [Royal Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Royal_Guard "Moroccan Royal Guard"), the [Royal Gendarmerie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Gendarmerie "Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie") and the [Auxiliary Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Forces "Auxiliary Forces"). Internal security is generally effective, and acts of political violence are rare (with one exception, the [2003 Casablanca bombings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Casablanca_bombings "2003 Casablanca bombings") which killed 45 people [^160]).

The UN maintains a small observer force in Western Sahara, where a large number of Moroccan troops are stationed. The Sahrawi [Polisario Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario_Front "Polisario Front") maintains an active militia of an estimated 5,000 fighters in Western Sahara and has engaged in intermittent warfare with Moroccan forces since the 1970s.

### Human rights

During the early 1960s to the late 1980s, under the leadership of [Hassan II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II "Hassan II"), Morocco had one of the worst human rights records in both Africa and the world. Government repression of political dissent was widespread during Hassan II's leadership, until it dropped sharply in the mid-1990s. The decades during which abuses were committed are referred to as the [Years of Lead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_\(Morocco\) "Years of Lead (Morocco)") (*les années de plomb*), and included [forced disappearances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance "Forced disappearance"), assassinations of government opponents and protesters, and secret internment camps such as [Tazmamart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazmamart "Tazmamart"). To examine abuses committed during the reign of [King Hassan II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II_of_Morocco "Hassan II of Morocco") (1961–1999), the government under King Mohammed set up an [Equity and Reconciliation Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_and_Reconciliation_Commission "Equity and Reconciliation Commission") (IER).[^161] [^162]

According to a [Human Rights Watch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch") annual report in 2016, Moroccan authorities restricted the rights to peaceful expression, association and assembly through several laws. The authorities continue to prosecute both printed and online media which criticises the government or the [king](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_VI_of_Morocco "Mohammed VI of Morocco") (or the royal family).[^163] There are also persistent allegations of violence against both [Sahrawi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_people "Sahrawi people") pro- [independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic") and pro- [Polisario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario "Polisario") [demonstrators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Intifada_\(Western_Sahara\) "Independence Intifada (Western Sahara)") [^164] in Western Sahara; a disputed territory which is occupied by and considered by Morocco as part of its [Southern Provinces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Provinces "Southern Provinces"). Morocco has been accused of detaining Sahrawi pro-independence activists as prisoners of conscience.[^165]

[Homosexual acts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory "LGBT rights by country or territory") as well as pre-marital sex are illegal in Morocco, and can be punishable by six months to three years of imprisonment.[^166] [^167] It is illegal to [proselytise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselytism "Proselytism") for any religion other than [Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Morocco "Islam in Morocco") (article 220 of the Moroccan Penal Code), and that crime is punishable by a maximum of 15 years of imprisonment.[^168] [^169] Violence against women and sexual harassment have been criminalised. The penalty can be from one month to five years, with fines ranging from $200 to $1,000.[^170] It is also a criminal offence in Morocco to undermine the monarchy; in August 2023, a Moroccan resident of Qatar was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for criticising the King's policy decisions on Facebook.[^171]

## Economy

[Casablanca Finance City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_Finance_City "Casablanca Finance City")

Morocco's economy is considered a relatively [liberal economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_economy "Liberal economy") governed by the [law of supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand"). Since 1993, the country has followed a policy of [privatisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization "Privatization") of certain economic sectors which used to be in the hands of the [government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Morocco "Politics of Morocco").[^172] Morocco has become a major player in African economic affairs,[^173] and is the [sixth largest economy in Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\) "List of African countries by GDP (PPP)") by GDP (PPP). Morocco was ranked as the first African country by the [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist_Intelligence_Unit "Economist Intelligence Unit") 's [quality-of-life index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-of-life_index "Quality-of-life index"), ahead of [South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa").[^174] However, in the years since that first-place ranking was given, Morocco has slipped into fourth place behind [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt").

Government reforms and steady yearly growth in the region of 4–5% from 2000 to 2007, including 4.9% year-on-year growth in 2003–2007 helped the Moroccan economy to become much more robust compared to a few years earlier. For 2012, the World Bank forecast a rate of 4% growth for Morocco and 4.2% for following year, 2013.[^175] Between 2000 and 2019, the share of Moroccan workers in agriculture declined, while those that are in industry increased.[^176]

### Tourism

The [Jemaa el-Fnaa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaa_el-Fnaa "Jemaa el-Fnaa") in Marrakech

Tourism is one of the most important sectors in the Moroccan economy.[^177] It is a strong tourist industry focused on the country's coast, culture, and history. In 2022, tourism in Morocco had surpassed the average number of visitors in the 2010s, while setting an all-time high in 2023 with 14.5 million international tourist arrivals and MAD 104.7 billion in receipts.[^176] In 2010, the government launched its Vision 2020, which plans to make Morocco one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world and to double the annual number of international arrivals to 20 million by 2020.[^178] In November 2024, Morocco had nearly 16 million tourists visiting that contributed to 7% of its GDP.[^179] [^176]

View of the medina (old city) of [Fez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez,_Morocco "Fez, Morocco")

Tourism is increasingly focused on Morocco's culture, such as its ancient cities. The modern tourist industry capitalises on Morocco's ancient and Islamic sites and on its landscape and cultural history. 60% of Morocco's tourists visit for its culture and heritage. Agadir is a major coastal resort and has a third of all Moroccan bed nights.[^180] It is a base for tours to the Atlas Mountains.[^180] Other resorts in northern Morocco are also very popular.[^181] [^182]

Large government sponsored marketing campaigns to attract tourists advertised Morocco as an inexpensive and exotic, yet safe, place for tourists. Most of the visitors to Morocco continue to be European, with French nationals making up almost 20% of all visitors. Most Europeans visit between April and August.[^183] Casablanca is the major cruise port in Morocco, and has a developed market for tourists in Morocco. The Majorelle botanical garden in Marrakech is a popular tourist attraction. It was bought by the fashion designer Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé in 1980.[^184] As of 2006, activity and adventure tourism in the Atlas and Rif Mountains are the fastest growth area in Moroccan tourism. These locations have walking and trekking opportunities from late March to mid-November. The government is investing in trekking circuits. They are also developing desert tourism in competition with [Tunisia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia").[^185]

### Agriculture

[Agriculture in Morocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Morocco "Agriculture in Morocco") employs about 40% of the nation's workforce, making it the largest employer in the country. In the rainy sections of the northwest, [barley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley "Barley"), [wheat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat"), and other cereals can be raised without irrigation. On the Atlantic coast, where there are extensive plains, [olives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive "Olive"), [citrus fruits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus_fruits "Citrus fruits"), and [wine grapes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_grapes "Wine grapes") are grown, largely with water supplied by artesian wells. [Livestock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock "Livestock") are raised and forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials. Part of the maritime population fishes for its livelihood. [Agadir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir "Agadir"), [Essaouira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essaouira "Essaouira"), [El Jadida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Jadida "El Jadida"), and [Larache](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larache "Larache") are among the important fishing harbors.[^186] Both the agriculture and fishing industries are [expected to be severely impacted by climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Morocco "Climate change in Morocco").[^187] [^188]

Moroccan agricultural production also consists of [oranges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_\(fruit\) "Orange (fruit)"), [tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato "Tomato"), [potatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato "Potato"), olives, and [olive oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil "Olive oil"). High quality agricultural products are usually exported to Europe. Morocco produces enough food for domestic consumption except for grains, [sugar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar "Sugar"), [coffee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee "Coffee") and [tea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea "Tea"). More than 40% of Morocco's consumption of grains and flour is imported from the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France").

The agriculture industry in Morocco enjoyed a complete tax exemption until 2013. Many Moroccan critics said that rich farmers and large agricultural companies were taking too much benefit of not paying the taxes and that poor farmers were struggling with high costs and are getting very poor support from the state. In 2014, as part of the Finance Law, it was decided that agricultural companies with a turnover of greater than MAD 5 million would pay progressive corporate income taxes.[^189]

### Infrastructure

[Al Boraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Boraq "Al Boraq") RGV2N2 high-speed trainset at [Tanger-Ville railway station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanger-Ville_Railway_Terminal "Tanger-Ville Railway Terminal") in November 2018

According to the [Global Competitiveness Report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Report "Global Competitiveness Report") of 2019, Morocco Ranked 32nd in the world in terms of Roads, 16th in Sea, 45th in Air and 64th in Railways. This gives Morocco the best infrastructure rankings in the African continent.[^190] To meet the growing domestic demand, the Moroccan government invested more than $15 billion from 2010 to 2015 in upgrading its basic infrastructure.[^191] Morocco also has the largest port in Africa and the Mediterranean, [Tanger-Med](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanger-Med "Tanger-Med"), which is ranked the 18th in the world with a handling capacity of over 9 million containers. It is situated in the Tangier free economic zone and serves as a logistics hub for Africa and the world.[^192]

In 2014, Morocco began the construction of the first [^193] high-speed railway system in Africa linking the cities of Tangier and Casablanca. It was inaugurated in 2018 by the King following over a decade of planning and construction by Moroccan national railway company [Office National des Chemins de Fer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONCF "ONCF") (ONCF).[^194] It is the first phase of what is planned to eventually be a 1,500 kilometeres (930 mi) high-speed rail network in Morocco. An extension of the line to Marrakesh is already being planned. The [Moroccan Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Logistics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Equipment,_Transport_and_Logistics_\(Morocco\) "Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Logistics (Morocco)") aims to build an additional 3,380 kilometers of expressway and 2,100 kilometers of highway by 2030 with [SNCF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCF "SNCF"); the project came at an expected cost of US$9.6 billion. The project also involved purchasing 18 high-speed trains and 150 multi-service trains.[^195]

### Energy

[Solar cell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell "Solar cell") panels in eastern Morocco

In 2008, about 56% of Morocco's electricity supply was provided by coal.[^196] However, as forecasts indicate that energy requirements in Morocco will rise 6% per year between 2012 and 2050,[^197] a new law passed encouraging Moroccans to look for ways to diversify the energy supply, including more [renewable resources](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_resources "Renewable resources"). The Moroccan government has launched a project to build a [solar thermal energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy "Solar thermal energy") [power plant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_plant "Power plant") [^198] and is also looking into the use of natural gas as a potential source of revenue for Morocco's government.[^197]

Morocco has embarked upon the construction of large [solar energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy "Solar energy") farms to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, and to eventually export electricity to [Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe").[^199] On 17 April 2022, Rabat-Moroccan agency for solar energy (Masen) and the ministry of energy transition and sustainable development announced the launch of phase one of the mega project Nor II solar energy plant which is a multi-site solar energy project with a total capacity set at 400 [megawatts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") (MN).[^200]

### Narcotics

Cannabis field at Ketama Tidighine mountain, Morocco

Since the 7th century, [cannabis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_\(drug\) "Cannabis (drug)") has been cultivated in the [Rif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif "Rif") region.[^201] In 2004, according to the UN World Drugs Report, cultivation and transformation of cannabis represents 0.57% of the national GDP of Morocco in 2002.[^202] According to a French Ministry of the Interior 2006 report, 80% of the cannabis resin ([hashish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish "Hashish")) consumed in Europe comes from the Rif region in Morocco, which is mostly mountainous terrain in the north of Morocco, also hosting plains that are very fertile and expanding from Melwiyya River and [Ras Kebdana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_Kebdana "Ras Kebdana") in the East to Tangier and [Cape Spartel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Spartel "Cape Spartel") in the West. Also, the region extends from the Mediterranean in the south, home of the Wergha River, to the north.[^203] In addition to that, Morocco is a transit point for cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe.[^204]

Water supply and sanitation in Morocco are provided by a wide array of utilities. They range from private companies in the largest city— [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca"), Rabat, and two other cities—to public municipal utilities in 13 other cities, as well as a national electricity and water company.[^205] Morocco's Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) is in charge of bulk water supply in about 500 towns.[^206] According to a study by the National Liquid Sanitation Master Plan (SNDAL) that started in 1994, only 15 of their 63 treatment plants are operational, and out of approximately 500million cubic meters of wastewater generated annually, 95% is discharged untreated into natural water bodies.[^205]

There have been substantial improvements in access to water supply, and to a lesser extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighbourhoods and limited sustainability of rural systems (20% of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005, a National Sanitation Programme was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020.[^207] The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the [National Human Development Initiative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Development_Initiative "National Human Development Initiative"), under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network. An investment programme of about MAD 15 billion was made to cover the centres managed by ONEP from 2003–2017.[^205] Japanese and Canadian cooperators and [AFESD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Fund_for_Economic_and_Social_Development "Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development") have also financed several projects for ONEP.[^205]

Though, between 1960 and 2020, the per capita availability of [renewable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_resource "Renewable resource") water resources went from 2,560m <sup>3</sup> to about 620m <sup>3</sup> per person annually. The World Bank has reported that they have supported the [Noor Solar Power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouarzazate_Solar_Power_Station "Ouarzazate Solar Power Station") project in Morocco with US$700 million in financing the project "To address water scarcity and its impacts on agriculture".[^208]

Campus of the [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_VI_Polytechnic_University "Mohammed VI Polytechnic University") in [Benguerir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benguerir "Benguerir")

The [Moroccan government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_government "Moroccan government") has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs. In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, [Abbas El Fassi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_El_Fassi "Abbas El Fassi"), announced that investment in science and technology would rise from US$620,000 in 2008 to US$8.5 million (69 million Moroccan dirhams) in 2009 to finance the laboratories construction, training courses for researchers and a scholarship programme for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research.[^209] Morocco was ranked 66th in the [Global Innovation Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index "Global Innovation Index") in 2024,[^210] an increase in ranking from 2020 at 75th.[^211]

The *Moroccan Innovation Strategy* was launched at the country's first National Innovation Summit in June 2009 by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Investment and the Digital Economy. The *Moroccan Innovation Strategy* fixed the target of producing 1,000 Moroccan patents and creating 200 innovative start-ups by 2014. In 2012, Moroccan inventors applied for 197 patents, up from 152 two years earlier. In 2011, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and New Technologies created a Moroccan Club of Innovation, in partnership with the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property. The idea is to create a network of players in innovation to help them develop innovative projects.[^212]

The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research is supporting research in advanced technologies. The [Moroccan Phosphate Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCP_Group "OCP Group") (*Office chérifien des phosphates*) has invested in a project to develop a [smart city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city "Smart city"), King Mohammed VI Green City, around Mohammed VI University located between Casablanca and Marrakesh,[^213] at a cost of DH 4.7 billion (circa US$479 million).[^212] [^214] In 2012, the [Hassan II Academy of Sciences and Technologies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Technologies "Hassan II Academy of Sciences and Technologies") identified a number of sectors where Morocco has a comparative advantage and skilled human capital, including mining, fisheries, food chemistry and new technologies. It also identified a number of strategic sectors, such as renewable energies, health sectors, the environment and geosciences.[^212] [^215]

On 20 May 2015, less than a year after its inception, the Higher Council for Education, Training and Scientific Research presented a report to the king offering a *Vision for Education in Morocco 2015–2030*. The report advocated making education egalitarian and, thus, accessible to the greatest number. The report also recommended developing an integrated national innovation system which would be financed by gradually increasing the share of GDP devoted to research and development (R&D) from 0.73% of GDP in 2010 to '1% in the short term, 1.5% by 2025 and 2% by 2030'.[^212] As of 2015, Morocco had three technoparks. Since the first technopark was established in Rabat in 2005, a second has been set up in Casablanca, followed, in 2015, by a third in Tangers. The technoparks host start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises specialising in [information and communication technologies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology "Information and communications technology") (ICTs), 'green' technologies (namely, [environmentally friendly technologies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_technology "Environmental technology")) and cultural industries.[^212] According to Office Marocain de la Propriété Industrielle et Commerciale, [patent filing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_application "Patent application") in Morocco grew by 167% during the period 2015–2019.[^216]

In 2024, Morocco is among the top four most-connected populations of a country to the Internet in Africa by number of population.[^217] In 2022, the number of internet users in Morocco reached around 31.6 million.[^218] Later, as of January 2024, Morocco had approximately 34.5 million internet users; it has a [penetration rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage "Global Internet usage") of about 90.7%.[^219] Morocco has several Internet-related projects; an example of such is the National Digital Development Strategy 2030.[^220] In 2024, as part of another program called the Connected Campus, the American wireless network provider [Cambium Networks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambium_Networks "Cambium Networks") deployed 18,000 [Wi-Fi access points](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point "Wireless access point") for public universities in Morocco.[^221]

## Demographics

### Population

Morocco has a population of around 37,076,584 inhabitants (2021 estimate).[^222] [^223] Morocco's population was 11.6 million in 1960.[^224] In 2024, 49.7% of the population is female, while 50.3% of it is male.[^219] According to the 2014 Morocco population census, there were around 84,000 immigrants in the country. Of these foreign-born residents, most were of [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people "French people") origin, followed by individuals mainly from various nations in West Africa and Algeria.[^225] There are also a number of foreign residents of [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people "Spanish people") origin. Some of them are descendants of colonial settlers, who primarily work for European multinational companies, while others are married to Moroccans or are retirees. Prior to independence, Morocco was home to half a million [Europeans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Moroccans "European Moroccans"), most of whom were [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian "Christian").[^226] Also, prior to independence, Morocco was home to 250,000 Spaniards.[^227] Morocco's once prominent [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") minority has decreased significantly since its peak of 265,000 in 1948, declining to around 3,500 in 2022.[^228]

Ethnolinguistic map of Morocco (1973) [^229]

Morocco has a large [diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_diaspora "Moroccan diaspora"), most of which is located in France, which has reportedly over one million Moroccans of up to the third generation. There are also large Moroccan communities in Spain (about 700,000 Moroccans),[^230] the Netherlands (360,000), and Belgium (300,000).[^231] Other large communities can be found in Italy, Canada, the United States and Israel, where [Moroccan Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Jews "Moroccan Jews") are thought to constitute the second biggest Jewish ethnic subgroup.[^232] Morocco is also the country with the largest Berber population in the world,[^233] [^234] with estimates typically ranging between 40–60% of the population.[^235] [^236]

#### Ethnic groups

In Morocco, [ethnic identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_identity "Ethnic identity") is deeply intertwined with language and culture, with the population primarily comprising two major groups: [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") and [Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers").[^237] [^238] However, the [Higher Planning Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haut_Commissariat_au_Plan_\(Morocco\) "Haut Commissariat au Plan (Morocco)"), the country's state statistics bureau, does not collect data on ethnic demographics, citing the historical difficulty of distinguishing between Arabs and Berbers, even among Berber speakers.[^239] [^240]

[Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") form the largest and majority [ethnic group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity "Ethnicity"),[^241] [^242] making up between 65% [^243] [^244] and 80% [^243] [^244] [^245] of the Moroccan population. It is estimated that the indigenous [Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers") constitute between 30% [^243] [^241] [^242] and 35% of the population.[^246] [^247] Berbers, who are also known as Amazigh, are typically divided into three main groups with varying dialects who live spread out in rural mountain areas, namely the [Rifians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifians "Rifians") in the [Rif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif "Rif"), the [Central Atlas Amazigh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_Atlas_Amazigh&action=edit&redlink=1 "Central Atlas Amazigh (page does not exist)") in the [Middle Atlas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Atlas "Middle Atlas"), and the [Shilha people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilha_people "Shilha people") in the [Anti-Atlas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Atlas "Anti-Atlas").[^242] [^248] Since the 7th century, the [influx of Arab migrants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migrations_to_the_Maghreb "Arab migrations to the Maghreb") from the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula") has contributed to shaping Morocco's demographic, cultural, and genetic landscape.[^249] Additionally, a considerable portion of the population includes [Haratin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haratin "Haratin"), [Sahrawis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawis "Sahrawis"), and [Gnawa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnawa "Gnawa"), descendants of West African or mixed-race [enslaved peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Saharan_slave_trade "Trans-Saharan slave trade"), as well as [Moriscos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morisco "Morisco"), European Muslims expelled from Spain and Portugal in the 17th century.[^250] [^251]

According to *[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica")*, 44% of Moroccans are Arab, 24% are [Arabized Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabized_Berber "Arabized Berber"), 21% are Berbers and 10% are Mauritanian Moors.[^252] Additionally, [Minority Rights Group International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Rights_Group_International "Minority Rights Group International") estimates that around 90,000 [Sahrawis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawis "Sahrawis") reside in internationally recognized Morocco, compared to approximately 190,000 in the disputed Western Sahara.[^251]

### Religion

The interior of a mosque in [Fes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fes "Fes"), Islam is the predominant religion in Morocco

The [Hassan II Mosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II_Mosque "Hassan II Mosque") in Casablanca

The religious affiliation in the country was estimated by the [Pew Forum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Forum "Pew Forum") in 2010 as 99% [Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim"), with all remaining groups accounting for less than 1% of the population.[^253] Of those affiliated with Islam, virtually all are [Sunni Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam"), with [Shia Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") accounting for less than 0.1%.[^254] However, nearly 15% of Moroccans nonetheless describe themselves as non religious according to a 2018 survey conducted by the research network Arab Barometer; the same survey saw nearly 100 percent of respondents identify as Muslims.[^255] Another 2021 Arab Barometer survey found that 67.8% of Moroccans identified as religious, 29.1% as somewhat religious, and 3.1% as non religious.[^256] The 2015 [Gallup International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_International_Association "Gallup International Association") poll reported that 93% of Moroccans considered themselves to be religious.[^257]

Prior to Morocco's independence in 1956, the country was home to a significant [Christian community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Morocco "Christianity in Morocco"), numbering over [500,000 Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Moroccans "European Moroccans"), predominantly of Spanish and French ancestry.[^258] These Catholic settlers had a historic legacy and a powerful presence.[^258] However, following Morocco's independence, many of these Christian settlers left to Spain or France.[^258] The predominantly [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") and [Protestant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") foreign-resident [Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") community consists of approximately 40,000 practising members. Most foreign resident [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") reside in the [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca"), [Tangier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier "Tangier"), [Marrakesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh "Marrakesh") and [Rabat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat "Rabat") urban areas.[^259] Meanwhile, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights estimates there are 25,000 Christian citizens.[^259]

Before the [founding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence") of the [State of Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel "State of Israel") in 1948, there were about [265,000 Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Jews "Moroccan Jews") [^260] in the country, which gave Morocco the largest Jewish community in the [Muslim world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world"). The most recent estimates put the size of the historic Casablanca Jewish community at about 2,500,[^261] [^262] and the Rabat and Marrakesh Jewish communities at about 100 members each. The remainder of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the country. This population is mostly elderly, with a decreasing number of young people.[^263] The [Baháʼí Faith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "Baháʼí Faith") community, located in urban areas, numbers 350 to 400 persons.[^263]

### Languages

Linguistic map of Morocco

Morocco's official languages are [Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") and [Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_language "Berber language").[^13] [^264] The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as [Darija](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darija "Darija").[^265] Approximately 92.7% of the whole population can speak Arabic. Berber languages are spoken by 24.8% of the population in three dialects ([Tarifit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riff_language "Riff language") spoken by 3.2%, [Tashelhit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilha_language "Shilha language") spoken by 14.2% and [Central Atlas Tamazight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Morocco_Tamazight "Central Morocco Tamazight") spoken by 7.4%).[^8] According to the [2024 census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2024_Moroccan_census&action=edit&redlink=1 "2024 Moroccan census (page does not exist)"), 99.2%, or almost the entire literate population of Morocco, could read and write in Arabic, whereas 1.5% of the population could read and write in Berber. The census also reported that 80.6% of Moroccans consider Arabic to be their native language, while 18.9% regard any of the various Berber languages as their mother tongue.[^8] [^266] After Morocco declared independence in 1956, French and Arabic became the main languages of administration and education.[^267]

[French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") is widely used in governmental institutions, media, mid-size and large companies, international commerce with French-speaking countries and often in international diplomacy.[^268] French is taught as an obligatory language in all schools. According to the 2004 census, 2.19 million Moroccans spoke a foreign language other than French.[^269] [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), while far behind French in terms of number of speakers, is the first foreign language of choice, since French is obligatory, among educated youth and professionals. In 2010, there were 10,366,000 French-speakers in Morocco, or about 32% of the population.[^270] [^10]

According to *[Ethnologue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnologue "Ethnologue")*, as of 2016, there are 1,536,590 individuals (or approximately 4.5% of the population) in Morocco who speak [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language").[^271] Spanish is mostly spoken in northern Morocco and the former [Spanish Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Sahara "Spanish Sahara") because Spain had previously occupied those areas.[^272] Meanwhile, a 2018 study by the [Instituto Cervantes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Cervantes "Instituto Cervantes") found 1.7 million Moroccans who were at least proficient in Spanish, placing Morocco as the country with the most Spanish speakers outside the Hispanophone world (unless the United States is also excluded from Spanish-speaking countries).[^273] A significant portion of northern Morocco receives Spanish media, television signal and radio airwaves, which reportedly facilitate competence in the language in the region.[^267]

Education in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school. The estimated [literacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy "Literacy") rate for the country in 2012 was 72%.[^274] In September 2006, UNESCO awarded Morocco, amongst other countries such as [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"), [Pakistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan"), [India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") and [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), the "UNESCO 2006 Literacy Prize".[^275]

Morocco has more than [four dozen universities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Morocco "List of universities in Morocco"), institutes of higher learning and polytechnics dispersed at urban centres throughout the country. Its leading institutions include [Mohammed V University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_V_University "Mohammed V University") in Rabat, the country's largest university, with branches in Casablanca and Fès; the Hassan II Agriculture and Veterinary Institute in Rabat, which conducts leading social science research in addition to its agricultural specialties; and [Al-Akhawayn University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Akhawayn_University "Al-Akhawayn University") in Ifrane, the first English-language university in Northwest Africa,[^276] inaugurated in 1995 with contributions from Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Many efforts are made by countries around the world to address health issues and eradicate disease, Morocco included. Morocco is a developing country that has made many strides to improve these categories. According to research published, in 2005, only 16% of citizens in Morocco had health insurance or coverage.[^281] In data from the World Bank, Morocco experiences high infant mortality rates at 20 deaths per 1,000 births (2017) [^282] and high maternal mortality rates at 121 deaths per 100,000 births (2015).[^283]

The government of Morocco sets up surveillance systems within the already existing healthcare system to monitor and collect data. Mass education in hygiene is implemented in primary education schools which are free for residents of Morocco. In 2005, the government of Morocco approved two reforms to expand health insurance coverage.[^281] The first reform was a mandatory health insurance plan for public and private sector employees to expand coverage from 16 percent of the population to 30 percent. The second reform created a fund to cover services for the poor. Both reforms improved access to high-quality care. Infant mortality has improved significantly since 1960 when there were 144 deaths per 1,000 live births, in 2000, 42 per 1,000 live births, and it is 15 per 1,000 live births in 2022.[^282] The country's under-five mortality rate dropped by 60% between 1990 and 2011.

According to data from the World Bank,[^282] the present mortality rate is still very high, over seven times higher than in neighbouring country Spain. In 2014, Morocco adopted a national plan to increase progress on maternal and child health.[^284] The Moroccan Plan was started by the Moroccan Minister of Health, El Houssaine Louardi and Ala Alwan, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, on 13 November 2013 in Rabat.[^284] Morocco has made significant progress in reducing deaths among both children and mothers. Based on World Bank data, the nation's maternal mortality ratio fell by 67% between 1990 and 2010.[^283]

In 2014, spending on healthcare accounted for 5.9% of the country's GDP.[^285] Since 2014, spending on healthcare as part of the GDP has decreased. However, health expenditure per capita (PPP) has steadily increased since 2000. In 2015, the Moroccan health expenditure was $435.29 per capita.[^286] In 2016, the life expectancy at birth was 74.3, or 73.3 for men and 75.4 for women, and there were 6.3 physicians and 8.9 nurses and midwives per 10,000 inhabitants.[^287] In 2024, according to the [World Factbook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook "The World Factbook"), life expectancy for Morocco is 74.2 years.[^288]

## Culture

A living room with a traditional Moroccan interior

Morocco is a country with a rich [culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture") and [civilisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization").[^289] Through [Moroccan history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Morocco "History of Morocco"), it has hosted many people. Culturally speaking, Morocco has combined its Arabic, Berber and Jewish cultural heritage with external influences such as the French and the Spanish and, during the last decades, the Anglo-American lifestyles.[^290] [^291] [^292] Since independence, painting and sculpture, music, amateur theatre and filmmaking have developed.[^293] The Moroccan National Theatre (founded 1956) offers regular productions of Moroccan and French dramatic works. Art and music festivals take place throughout the country during the summer months, among them the [World Sacred Music Festival at Fès](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Sacred_Music_Festival "World Sacred Music Festival").

### Architecture

The *[ksar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksar "Ksar")* of [Ait Benhaddou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ait_Benhaddou "Ait Benhaddou") in the southern [High Atlas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Atlas "High Atlas") mountains

[Colonial architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Colonial "French Colonial") in Casablanca (20th century)

[Moroccan architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_architecture "Moroccan architecture") reflects Morocco's diverse geography and long history, marked by successive waves of settlers through both migration and military conquest. This architectural heritage includes [ancient Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") sites, historic [Islamic architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_architecture "Islamic architecture"), local [vernacular architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_architecture "Vernacular architecture"), 20th-century [French colonial architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_architecture "French colonial architecture"), and [modern architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture "Modern architecture").[^294]

Much of Morocco's traditional architecture is marked by the style that developed during the [Islamic period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Islam "History of Islam"), from the 7th century onward. This architecture was part of a wider tradition of ["Moorish" or western Islamic architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_architecture "Moorish architecture"), which characterized both the [Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb "Maghreb") (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) and [al-Andalus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") (Muslim Spain and Portugal).[^295] [^296] [^294] [^297] It blended influences from [Amazigh (Berber)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers") culture in [North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa"), pre-Islamic Spain ([Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Roman_architecture "Ancient Roman architecture"), [Byzantine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_architecture "Byzantine architecture"), and [Visigothic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_art_and_architecture "Visigothic art and architecture")), and contemporary artistic currents in the Islamic [Middle East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") to elaborate a unique style over centuries with recognizable features such as the [horseshoe arch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_arch "Horseshoe arch"), *[riad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riad_\(architecture\) "Riad (architecture)")* gardens, and elaborate [geometric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns "Islamic geometric patterns") and [arabesque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabesque "Arabesque") motifs in wood, [carved stucco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stucco_decoration_in_Islamic_architecture "Stucco decoration in Islamic architecture"), and *[zellij](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij "Zellij")* tilework.[^295] [^296] [^298] [^299]

Although Moroccan Amazigh architecture is not strictly separate from the rest of Moroccan architecture, many structures and architectural styles are distinctively associated with traditionally Amazigh or Amazigh-dominated regions such as the [Atlas Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Mountains "Atlas Mountains") and the Sahara and pre-Sahara regions.[^300] These mostly rural regions are marked by numerous [kasbahs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasbah "Kasbah") (fortresses) and *[ksour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksar "Ksar")* (fortified villages) shaped by local geography and social structures, of which one of the most famous is [Ait Benhaddou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%AFt_Benhaddou "Aït Benhaddou").[^301] They are typically made of [rammed earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth "Rammed earth") and decorated with local geometric motifs. Far from being isolated from other historical artistic currents around them, the Amazigh peoples of Morocco (and across North Africa) adapted the forms and ideas of Islamic architecture to their own conditions [^302] and in turn contributed to the formation of Western Islamic art, particularly during their political domination of the region over the centuries of [Almoravid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty"), [Almohad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate "Almohad Caliphate"), and [Marinid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinid_Sultanate "Marinid Sultanate") rule.[^299] [^300]

[Modern architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture "Modern architecture") in Morocco includes many examples of early 20th-century [Art Deco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco "Art Deco") and local [neo-Moorish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_Revival_architecture "Moorish Revival architecture") architecture constructed during the [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Protectorate_in_Morocco "French Protectorate in Morocco") and [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_protectorate_in_Morocco "Spanish protectorate in Morocco") colonial occupation of the country between 1912 and 1956 (or until 1958 for Spain).[^303] [^304] In the later 20th century, after Morocco regained its independence, some new buildings continued to pay tribute to traditional Moroccan architecture and motifs (even when designed by foreign architects), as exemplified by the [Mausoleum of King Mohammed V](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Mohammed_V "Mausoleum of Mohammed V") (completed in 1971) and the massive [Hassan II Mosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II_Mosque "Hassan II Mosque") in [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca") (completed in 1993).[^305] [^306] Modernist architecture is also evident in contemporary constructions, not only for regular everyday structures but also in major prestige projects.[^307] [^308]

### Literature

[Driss Chraïbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driss_Chra%C3%AFbi "Driss Chraïbi")

[Moroccan literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_literature "Moroccan literature") is written mostly in Arabic, Berber, Hebrew and French. Particularly under the [Almoravid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty") and [Almohad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate "Almohad Caliphate") empires, Moroccan literature was closely related to the [literature of al-Andalus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_of_al-Andalus "Literature of al-Andalus"), and shared important poetic and literary forms such as *[zajal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zajal "Zajal")*, the *[muwashshah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muwashshah "Muwashshah")* and the *[maqama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maqama "Maqama")*. Islamic literature, such as [Quranic exegeses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir "Tafsir") and other religious works such as [Qadi Ayyad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadi_Ayyad "Qadi Ayyad") 's [*Al-Shifa*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa_bi_Ta%27rif_Huquq_al-Mustafa "Al-Shifa bi Ta'rif Huquq al-Mustafa"), were influential. The [University of al-Qarawiyyin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_al-Qarawiyyin "University of al-Qarawiyyin") in Fes was an important literary centre attracting scholars from abroad, including [Maimonides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides "Maimonides"), [Ibn al-Khatib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Khatib "Ibn al-Khatib"), and [Ibn Khaldun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun "Ibn Khaldun").

Under the [Almohad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad "Almohad") dynasty Morocco experienced a period of prosperity and brilliance of learning. The Almohad built the [Kutubiyya Mosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutubiyya_Mosque "Kutubiyya Mosque") in Marrakesh, which accommodated no fewer than 25,000 people, but was also famed for its books, manuscripts, libraries and book shops, which gave it its name; the first book [bazaar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar "Bazaar") in history. The Almohad Caliph [Abu Yakub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_I,_Almohad_Caliph "Yusuf I, Almohad Caliph") had a great love for collecting books. He founded a great library, which was eventually carried to the [Casbah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casbah "Casbah") and turned into a [public library](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library "Public library").

Modern Moroccan literature began in the 1930s. Two main factors gave Morocco a pulse toward witnessing the birth of modern literature. Morocco, as a [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Morocco "French Morocco") and [Spanish protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Morocco "Spanish Morocco") left Moroccan intellectuals the opportunity to exchange and to produce literary works freely with the contact of other [Arabic literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_literature "Arabic literature") and Europe. Three generations of writers especially shaped 20th century Moroccan literature.[^309] The first was the generation that lived and wrote during the [Protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_protectorate_of_Morocco "French protectorate of Morocco") (1912–1956), its most important representative being [Mohammed Ben Brahim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ben_Brahim "Mohammed Ben Brahim") (1897–1955). The second generation played an important role in the transition to independence, with writers like [Abdelkrim Ghallab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelkrim_Ghallab "Abdelkrim Ghallab") (1919–2006), [Allal al-Fassi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allal_al-Fassi "Allal al-Fassi") (1910–1974) and [Mohammed al-Mokhtar Soussi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_al-Mokhtar_Soussi "Mohammed al-Mokhtar Soussi") (1900–1963). The third generation is that of writers of the sixties. Moroccan literature had writers such as [Mohamed Choukri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Choukri "Mohamed Choukri"), [Driss Chraïbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driss_Chra%C3%AFbi "Driss Chraïbi"), [Mohamed Zafzaf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Zafzaf "Mohamed Zafzaf") and [Driss El Khouri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driss_El_Khouri "Driss El Khouri").

During the 1950s and 1960s, Morocco was a refuge and artistic centre and attracted writers as [Paul Bowles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bowles "Paul Bowles"), [Tennessee Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams "Tennessee Williams") and [William S. Burroughs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs "William S. Burroughs"). Moroccan literature flourished with novelists such as [Mohamed Zafzaf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Zafzaf "Mohamed Zafzaf") and [Mohamed Choukri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Choukri "Mohamed Choukri"), who wrote in Arabic, and [Driss Chraïbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driss_Chra%C3%AFbi "Driss Chraïbi") and [Tahar Ben Jelloun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahar_Ben_Jelloun "Tahar Ben Jelloun") who wrote in French. Other important Moroccan authors include: [Abdellatif Laabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdellatif_Laabi "Abdellatif Laabi"), [Abdelkrim Ghallab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelkrim_Ghallab "Abdelkrim Ghallab"), [Fouad Laroui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouad_Laroui "Fouad Laroui"), [Mohammed Berrada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Berrada "Mohammed Berrada") and [Leila Abouzeid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Abouzeid "Leila Abouzeid"). Orature (oral literature) is also an integral part of Moroccan culture, be it in Moroccan Arabic or Berber.

### Music

Moroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins. Rock-influenced [chaabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaabi_\(Morocco\) "Chaabi (Morocco)") bands are widespread, as is [trance music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance_music "Trance music") with historical origins in [Islamic music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_music "Islamic music"). Amazigh people have also played music using a *lotar*, a type of lute from the Rwais tribe in the High Atlas mountains. The lotar is usually played by a duo, which may also include a *[rebab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebab "Rebab")*.[^310] The Berber music is usually [monodic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monody "Monody") with a pentatonic scale system.[^311] [Malḥūn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malhun "Malhun") poetry in oral form is also accompanied by traditional instruments, such as lutes, violins, rebabs and small drums.[^312] [^313]

A group of [Jilala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilala "Jilala") musicians in 1900

*[Aita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aita_\(Morocco\) "Aita (Morocco)")* is a [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") musical style sung in the countryside. [Chaabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaabi "Chaabi") ("popular") is music consisting of numerous varieties that are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting. Morocco is also home to [Andalusian classical music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_classical_music "Andalusian classical music") that is found throughout Northwest Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in [Cordoba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Spain "Córdoba, Spain"), and the Persian-born musician [Ziryab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziryab "Ziryab") is usually credited with its invention.[^314] A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian music is the brainchild of [Morisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morisco "Morisco") visual artist, composer and [oudist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud "Oud") [Tarik Banzi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus_Ensemble "Al-Andalus Ensemble"), founder of the Al-Andalus Ensemble. Artists like [Nass El Ghiwane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nass_El_Ghiwane "Nass El Ghiwane") and [Jil Jilala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jil_Jilala "Jil Jilala") mix traditional styles with modern influences. Popular Western forms of music are also becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as [fusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_\(music\) "Fusion (music)"), rock, [country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music"), [metal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_\(music\) "Metal (music)") and, in particular, [hip hop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music "Hip hop music"). [Arabic pop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_pop "Arabic pop") artists such as [Hatim Ammor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatim_Ammor "Hatim Ammor") and [ElGrandeToto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGrandeToto "ElGrandeToto") [^315] are well-known.

### Media

Cinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of *Le chevrier Marocain* ("The Moroccan Goatherd") by [Louis Lumière](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re "Louis Lumière") in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the [Ouarzazate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouarzazate "Ouarzazate") area. In 1944, the [Moroccan Cinematographic Centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moroccan_Cinematographic_Centre&action=edit&redlink=1 "Moroccan Cinematographic Centre (page does not exist)") (CCM), the nation's film [regulatory agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency "Regulatory agency"), was established. Studios were also opened in Rabat.

In 1952, [Orson Welles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles "Orson Welles") ' [*Othello*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello_\(1952_film\) "Othello (1952 film)") won the [Palme d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") under the Moroccan flag. However, the Festival's musicians did not play the [Moroccan national anthem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymne_Ch%C3%A9rifien "Hymne Chérifien"), as no one in attendance knew what it was.[^316] Six years later, Mohammed Ousfour would create the first Moroccan movie, *[Le fils maudit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Le_fils_maudit&action=edit&redlink=1 "Le fils maudit (page does not exist)")* ("The Damned Son"). In 1968, the first Mediterranean Film Festival was held in Tangier. In its current incarnation, the event is held in [Tetouan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetouan "Tetouan"). This was followed in 1982 with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat. In 2001, the first [International Film Festival of Marrakech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Film_Festival_of_Marrakech "International Film Festival of Marrakech") (FIFM) was held in [Marrakech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakech "Marrakech"). Some of Moroccan television channels include [2M](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M_\(TV_channel\) "2M (TV channel)"), [Al Aoula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Aoula "Al Aoula") (Societe Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Television) and [Medi 1 TV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medi_1_TV "Medi 1 TV").

### Cuisine

Moroccan [Couscous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous "Couscous")

Moroccan cuisine is considered one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world.[^317] The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines. Spices are used extensively in Moroccan cuisine. While spices have been imported to Morocco for thousands of years, many ingredients such as [saffron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron "Saffron") from [Tiliouine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9touan "Tétouan"), [mint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha "Mentha") and [olives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive "Olive") from [Meknes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meknes "Meknes"), and oranges and lemons from Fez, are home-grown.

Chicken is the most widely eaten meat in Morocco. The most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco is beef; [lamb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep "Sheep") is preferred but is relatively expensive.[^318] The main Moroccan dish most people are familiar with is [couscous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous "Couscous"),[^319] the old national delicacy. Beef is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a tagine with vegetables or legumes. Chicken is also very commonly used in tagines; one of the most famous tagine is the tagine of chicken, potatoes and olives. [Lamb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_sheep "Domestic sheep") is also consumed, but as Northwest African sheep breeds store most of their fat in their tails, Moroccan lamb does not have the pungent flavour that Western [lamb and mutton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton "Lamb and mutton") have. Poultry is also very common, and the use of seafood is increasing in Moroccan food. In addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as kliia/khlia [^320] and "g'did" which are used to flavor tagines or used in "el ghraif", a folded savory Moroccan pancake.

Among the most famous Moroccan dishes are [Couscous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous "Couscous"), [Pastilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastilla "Pastilla") (also spelled Bsteeya or Bestilla), [Tajine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajine "Tajine"), [Tanjia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangia "Tangia") and [Harira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harira "Harira"). Although the latter is a [soup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup "Soup"), it is considered a dish in itself and is served as such or with [dates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_\(fruit\) "Date (fruit)") especially during the month of [Ramadan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan "Ramadan"). Pork consumption is forbidden in accordance with [Sharia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia "Sharia"), religious laws of Islam.

A big part of the daily meal is bread. Bread in Morocco is principally from durum wheat semolina known as [khobz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khubz "Khubz"). Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town and village. The most common is whole grain coarse ground or white flour bread. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads. The most popular drink is "atai", [green tea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea "Green tea") with mint leaves and other ingredients.

### Sport

Moroccan football fans

Football is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular. In 1986, Morocco became the first Arab and African country to qualify for the second round of the [FIFA World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup"). Morocco hosted the [Africa Cup of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Cup_of_Nations "Africa Cup of Nations") in [1988](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_African_Cup_of_Nations "1988 African Cup of Nations") and will host it again in [2025](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Africa_Cup_of_Nations "2025 Africa Cup of Nations") after original host Guinea was stripped from hosting rights due to inadequacy of hosting preparations. Morocco was originally scheduled to host the [2015 Africa Cup of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Africa_Cup_of_Nations "2015 Africa Cup of Nations"),[^321] but refused to host the tournament on the scheduled dates because of fears over the [Ebola outbreak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_outbreak "Ebola outbreak") on the continent.[^322] Morocco made six attempts to host the FIFA World Cup but lost five times to the United States, France, Germany, South Africa and a Canada–Mexico–United States joint bid, however Morocco will co-host it in [2030](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030_FIFA_World_Cup "2030 FIFA World Cup") along with [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") and [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") having finally won the bid in their sixth attempt. In [2022](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup "2022 FIFA World Cup"), Morocco became the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals and finished 4th in the tournament.[^323]

At the [1984 Olympic Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics "1984 Summer Olympics"), two Moroccans won gold medals in track and field. [Nawal El Moutawakel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawal_El_Moutawakel "Nawal El Moutawakel") won in the [400 metres hurdles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles "400 metres hurdles"); she was the first woman from an Arab or Islamic country to win an Olympic gold medal. [Saïd Aouita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%C3%AFd_Aouita "Saïd Aouita") won the [5000 metres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres "5000 metres") at the same games. [Hicham El Guerrouj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicham_El_Guerrouj "Hicham El Guerrouj") won gold medals for Morocco at the [2004 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics "2004 Summer Olympics") in the [1500 metres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres "1500 metres") and 5000 metres and holds several [world records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_athletics "List of world records in athletics") in the [mile run](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_run "Mile run").

[Spectator sports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectator_sports "Spectator sports") in Morocco traditionally centred on the art of [horsemanship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsemanship "Horsemanship") until European sports— [football](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football"), [polo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo "Polo"), [swimming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_\(sport\) "Swimming (sport)") and [tennis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis "Tennis") —were introduced at the end of the 19th century. Tennis and [golf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf "Golf") have become popular.[^324] [^325] Several Moroccan professional players have competed in international competition, and the country fielded its first [Davis Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup "Davis Cup") team in 1999. Morocco established one of Africa's first competitive leagues in basketball.[^326] [Rugby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football "Rugby football") came to Morocco in the early 20th century, mainly by the French who occupied the country.[^327] As a result, [Moroccan rugby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_in_Morocco "Rugby union in Morocco") was tied to the fortunes of France, during the first and second [World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War "World War"), with many Moroccan players going away to fight.[^327] Like many other Maghreb nations, Moroccan rugby tended to look to Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa. [Kickboxing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing "Kickboxing") is also popular in Morocco.[^328] The Moroccan-Dutch [Badr Hari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badr_Hari "Badr Hari"), heavyweight kickboxer and martial artist, is a former K-1 heavyweight champion and K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 and 2009 finalist.[^329]
