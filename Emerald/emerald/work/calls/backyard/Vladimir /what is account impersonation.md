  Account impersonation is a technique used in computer systems to allow one
  user or system to temporarily assume the identity of another user or system,
  in order to perform specific actions on their behalf. This is also known as
  "delegated identity" or "assumed identity".

  In account impersonation, a user or system (called the "delegator") grants
  permission to another user or system (called the "impersonator") to act on
  their behalf. The impersonator can then access resources and perform actions
  that the delegator is authorized to do.

  Account impersonation is often used in **service-to-service** communication, where
  one service needs to access resources or **perform actions on behalf of**
  **another service**. It is also used in scenarios where a user wants to ==delegate==
  access to their resources to another user or system.

  Account impersonation is typically implemented using access tokens or API
  keys. 
  The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">delegator</mark> generates a token or key that the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">impersonator</mark> can use
  to authenticate itself as the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">delegator</mark>. The token or key includes
  information about the delegator's identity and permissions, and it is time-
  limited to ensure that the impersonator cannot continue to act as the
  delegator indefinitely.

  Account impersonation can be useful for simplifying access control and
  reducing the need for managing individual service accounts. However, it is
  important to implement it securely, to ensure that the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">impersonator</mark> cannot
  access resources or perform actions beyond what the delegator has
  authorized.

  In summary, account impersonation is a technique used in computer systems to
  allow one user or system to temporarily assume the identity of another user
  or system, in order to perform specific actions on their behalf. It is
  typically implemented using access tokens or API keys, and it can help to
  simplify access control and reduce the need for managing individual service
  accounts.
