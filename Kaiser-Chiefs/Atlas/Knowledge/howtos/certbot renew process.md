  When you run  certbot renew , Certbot checks if any of your certificates are
  near expiration (**typically within 30 days**) and attempts to renew them. If a
  certificate is due for renewal, Certbot will:

  1. Check the certificate's expiration date.
  2. Generate a new certificate request (CSR) if necessary.
  3. Submit the request to Let's Encrypt.
  4. Obtain the new certificate from Let's Encrypt.
  5. Deploy the new certificate to your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

  Here are some options you can use with  certbot renew :

  •  --dry-run : Simulate the renewal process without making any changes to your
  certificates or configuration.
  •  --force-renewal : Renew all certificates, even if they're not near expiration.
  •  --quiet : Suppress most output, only showing errors or important messages.
  •  --non-interactive : Disable interactive prompts and assume "yes" to all
  questions.

  Example usage:

```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
```

  This command will simulate the renewal process, showing you what Certbot would
  do without actually making any changes.

  Remember to run  certbot renew  regularly to ensure your certificates remain
  valid and up-to-date.
