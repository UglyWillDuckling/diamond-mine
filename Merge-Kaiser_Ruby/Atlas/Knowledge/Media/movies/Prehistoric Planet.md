Prehistoric Planet is a British–American nature documentary television series about dinosaurs, that premiered on [[Apple TV+]] beginning **May 23, 2022.** It is produced by the [[BBC Studios]] Natural History Unit, with Jon Favreau as showrunner, visual effects by The Moving Picture Company, and narration by natural historian[[ Sir David Attenborough]].

The documentary follows dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals recreated with computer-generated imagery, living around the globe in the Late [[Cretaceous]] period **66 million years ago** ([[Maastrichtian]]), just before the non-avian dinosaurs' extinction. It set out to depict prehistoric life using current palaeontological research by including accurately `feathered` dinosaurs, and speculative animal behaviour.

[[Hans Zimmer]], [[Kara Talve]], and [[Anže Rozman]] composed the soundtrack. It is the first major dinosaur-focused documentary series produced by the BBC since [[Planet Dinosaur]] in 2011, and the third overall.[3][4][5] Prehistoric Planet received critical acclaim for its visual effects, depiction of dinosaurs, and Attenborough's narration.

# Production

According to palaeontologist and consultant [[Steve Brusatte]], the series had been in development "a decade" prior to its trailer release.[6] On May 8, 2019, it was first reported by Deadline that Apple had ordered a new documentary series by BBC Studios titled Prehistoric Planet, to be executively produced by [[Jon Favreau]].[7] An original score was composed by Kara Talve, Anže Rozman and Hans Zimmer.[8]

The series uses up-to-date palaeontological research to depict its animals of the Cretaceous with scientific rigour; for example, feathered dinosaurs are featured in the series, such as juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.[8] Palaeozoologist [[Darren Naish]] was the lead consultant for the depictions of prehistoric life in the series.[9] The storyboarding (using scripts and synopses by BBC NHU), concept art and creature designs were created by [[Jellyfish Pictures]],[10] while box-generated imagery was developed by [[The Moving Picture Company]] and intended to be photorealistic, as with their previous productions [[The Jungle Book (2016)]] and The [[Lion King (2019)]].[2]

After its release, the series consultants other than [[Darren Naish]] were revealed to be Steve Brusatte, Alexander Farnsworth, Kiersten Formoso, Michael Habib, Scott Hartman, John R. Hutchinson, Luke Muscutt, Peter Skelton, Robert Spicer, Paul Valdes and Mark Witton.[11] David Krentz, the director of Dinosaur Revolution and character designer on Disney's Dinosaur, was also revealed to have been involved in the creature development and design.[12]

> [!NOTE]
> In March 2023, Apple renewed the series for a second season, which began airing on 22 May 2023.[13].
