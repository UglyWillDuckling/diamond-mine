**Zog I** (born **Ahmed Muhtar Zogolli**; 8 October 1895 – 9 April 1961) was the leader of [Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Kingdom_\(1928%E2%80%931939\) "Albanian Kingdom (1928–1939)") from 1922 to 1939. At age 27, he first served as Albania's youngest ever [Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Albania "Prime Minister of Albania") (1922–1924), then as [president](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Albania "President of Albania") (1925–1928), and finally as [King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Albania "King of Albania") (1928–1939).

Born to an aristocratic [beylik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bey "Bey") family in [Ottoman Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Albania "Ottoman Albania"), Zogolli was active in Albanian politics from a young age and fought on the side of [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary") during the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"). In 1922, he adopted the name **Ahmed Zogu**. He held various ministerial posts in the [Albanian government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Albania "Principality of Albania") before being driven into exile in June 1924, but returned later in the year with [Yugoslav](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia") and [White Russian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement "White movement") military support and was subsequently elected prime minister. Zogu was elected president in January 1925 and vested with dictatorial powers, with which he enacted major domestic reforms, suppressed [civil liberties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties "Civil liberties"), and struck an alliance with [Benito Mussolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") 's [Fascist Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy "Fascist Italy"). In September 1928, Albania was proclaimed a monarchy and he acceded to the throne as Zog I, King of the Albanians. He married [Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Apponyi_de_Nagy-Appony "Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony") in 1938, and their only child, [Leka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leka,_Crown_Prince_of_Albania "Leka, Crown Prince of Albania"), was born a year later.

Albania fell further under Italian influence during Zog's reign, and by the end of the 1930s the country had become almost fully dependent on Italy despite Zog's resistance. In April 1939, Italy [invaded Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_invasion_of_Albania "Italian invasion of Albania") and the country was rapidly overrun. Mussolini declared Albania an [Italian protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_\(1939%E2%80%931943\) "Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)") under King [Victor Emmanuel III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_III "Victor Emmanuel III"), forcing Zog into exile. He lived in England during the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") but was barred from returning to Albania by the [anti-monarchist government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania "People's Socialist Republic of Albania") led by [Enver Hoxha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha "Enver Hoxha"). Zog spent the rest of his life in France and died in April 1961 at the age of 65. His remains were buried at the [Thiais Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_parisien_de_Thiais "Cimetière parisien de Thiais") near Paris, before being transferred to the [royal mausoleum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_the_Albanian_Royal_Family "Mausoleum of the Albanian Royal Family") in [Tirana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana "Tirana") in 2012.

Zog was born as Ahmed Muhtar Zogolli in [Burgajet Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgajet_Castle "Burgajet Castle"), near [Burrel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrel "Burrel") in northern Albania, third son to [Xhemal Pasha Zogolli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhemal_Pasha_Zogolli "Xhemal Pasha Zogolli"), and first son by his second wife [Sadije Toptani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadije_Toptani "Sadije Toptani") in 1895. His family was a [beylik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bey "Bey") family of [landowners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landowner "Landowner"), with feudal authority over the region of [Mati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_District "Mat District"). His grandfather was [Xhelal Pasha Zogolli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhelal_Pasha_Zogolli "Xhelal Pasha Zogolli"). His mother's [Toptani family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toptani_family "Toptani family") claimed to be descended from the sister of Albania's greatest national hero, the 15th-century general [Skanderbeg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg "Skanderbeg"). He was educated at [Galatasaray High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_High_School "Galatasaray High School") ([French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): *Lycée Impérial de Galatasaray*) in [Beyoğlu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyo%C4%9Flu "Beyoğlu"), a district of the capital of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), Upon his father's death in 1911, Zogolli became governor of Mat, being appointed ahead of his elder half-brother, [Xhelal Bey Zogolli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhelal_Bey_Zogolli "Xhelal Bey Zogolli").

In 1912, he participated in the [Albanian Declaration of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "Albanian Declaration of Independence") as the representative of the Mat District. As a young man during the First World War, Zogolli volunteered on the side of [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"). He was detained at [Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") in 1917 and 1918 and in Rome in 1918 and 1919 before returning to Albania in 1919. During his time in Vienna, he grew to enjoy a Western European lifestyle. Upon his return, Zogolli became involved in the political life of the fledgling Albanian government that had been created in the wake of the First World War. His political supporters included many southern feudal landowners called [beys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bey "Bey"), Turkish for "province chieftain" with title variations including Beyg, Begum, Bygjymi.[^3] The Bey title refers to the social group to which he belonged, which was also used by noble families in the north, along with merchants, industrialists, and intellectuals. During the early 1920s, Zogolli served as Governor of [Shkodër](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkod%C3%ABr "Shkodër") (1920–1921), Minister of the Interior (March–November 1920, 1921–1924), and chief of the Albanian military (1921–1922). His primary rivals were [Luigj Gurakuqi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigj_Gurakuqi "Luigj Gurakuqi") and [Fan S. Noli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_S._Noli "Fan S. Noli"). In 1922, Zogolli formally changed his surname from Zogolli to Zogu, which sounds more Albanian.[^4]

In 1923, he was shot and wounded in [Parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Albania "Parliament of Albania"). A crisis arose in 1924 after the assassination of one of Zogu's industrialist opponents, [Avni Rustemi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avni_Rustemi "Avni Rustemi"); in the aftermath, a [leftist revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Revolution "June Revolution") forced Zogu, along with 600 of his allies, into exile in June 1924. He returned to Albania with the backing of [Yugoslav](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia") forces and Yugoslavia-based General [Pyotr Wrangel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Wrangel "Pyotr Wrangel") 's White Russian troops led by Russian Gen [Sergei Ulagay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Ulagay "Sergei Ulagay") [^5] and became [prime minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Albania "List of Prime Ministers of Albania").

Standard used by Ahmet Zogu as President of the First Republic.

Zogu was officially elected as the first [President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Albania "List of Presidents of Albania") of [Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Republic_\(1925%E2%80%931928\) "Albanian Republic (1925–1928)") by the Constituent Assembly on 21 January 1925, taking office on 1 February for a seven-year term. A new constitution vested Zogu with sweeping executive and legislative powers, to the point that he was effectively a dictator.[^6] He had the right to appoint all major government personnel, as well as one-third of the lower house.[^7]

Zogu's government followed the European model, though large parts of Albania still maintained a social structure unchanged from the days of Ottoman rule, and most villages were serf plantations run by the Beys. On 28 June 1925, Zogu ceded [Sveti Naum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveti_Naum "Sveti Naum") to [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia "Yugoslavia") in exchange for [Peshkëpi (Pëshkupat)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu%C3%A7imas "Buçimas") village and other concessions.[^8] [^9]

Zogu enacted several major reforms. His principal ally during this period was the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_\(1922%E2%80%931943\) "Fascist Italy (1922–1943)"), which lent his government funds in exchange for a greater role in Albania's fiscal policy. His administration was marred by disputes with [Kosovo Albanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Albanians "Kosovo Albanians") leaders, primarily [Hasan Prishtina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Bej_Prishtina "Hasan Bej Prishtina") and [Bajram Curri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajram_Curri "Bajram Curri"), among others.

On the debit side, Zogu's Albania was a police state in which civil liberties were all but nonexistent and the press was closely censored. Political opponents were imprisoned and often killed. For all intents and purposes, he held all governing power in the nation.[^7]

Ahmed Zogu

On 1 September 1928, Albania was transformed into a [kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Kingdom_\(1928%E2%80%931939\) "Albanian Kingdom (1928–1939)"), and President Zogu declared himself to be Zog I, with the title *King of the [Albanians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians "Albanians")*. He appointed as his advisor [Mehmed Orhan Efendi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_Orhan "Mehmed Orhan"), a [prince](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_dynasty "Ottoman dynasty") of the recently abolished [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"). He took as his regnal name his surname rather than his forename since the Islamic name *Ahmet* might have had the effect of isolating him on the European stage. He also initially took the parallel name "Skanderbeg III" (Zogu claimed to be a successor of [Skanderbeg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg "Skanderbeg") through descent through Skanderbeg's sister; "Skanderbeg II" was taken to be [Prince Wied](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wied,_Prince_of_Albania "Wied, Prince of Albania"), but this fell out of use).[^10]

On the same day as he declared himself king (he was never technically crowned), he also declared himself [Field Marshal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Marshal "Field Marshal") of the [Royal Albanian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albanian_Army "Royal Albanian Army"). He proclaimed a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy") similar to the contemporary regime in Italy, created a strong police force, and instituted the [Zogist salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zogist_salute "Zogist salute") (flat hand over the heart with palm facing downwards). Zog hoarded gold coins and precious stones, which were used to back Albania's first [paper currency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_currency "Paper currency").

Royal standard of Zog I and of the Army

Zog's mother, Sadije, was declared Queen Mother of Albania, and Zog also gave his brother and sisters Royal status as Prince and Princesses Zogu. One of his sisters, [Senije](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Senije_Zogu "Princess Senije Zogu") (c. 1897 – 1969), married [Shehzade Mehmed Abid Efendi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eehzade_Mehmed_Abid "Şehzade Mehmed Abid"), another Ottoman prince and son of Sultan [Abdul Hamid II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II "Abdul Hamid II").

Zog's constitution forbade any Prince of the Royal House from serving as Prime Minister or a member of the Cabinet, and contained provisions for the potential extinction of the royal family. The constitution also forbade the union of the Albanian throne with that of any other country, a term which would later be violated with the [Italian invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_invasion_of_Albania "Italian invasion of Albania"). Under the Zogist constitution, the King of the Albanians, like the [King of the Belgians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Belgian_monarchs "List of Belgian monarchs"), ascended the throne and exercised Royal powers only after taking an oath before Parliament; Zog himself swore an oath on the [Bible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible") and the [Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") (the king being [Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims")) in an attempt to unify the country. In 1929, King Zog abolished [Islamic law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia "Sharia") in Albania, adopting in its place a [civil code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_code "Civil code") based on the [Swiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") one, as [Mustafa Kemal Atatürk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk") [had done](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_reforms "Atatürk's reforms") in [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_Turkey "Secularism in Turkey") in the same decade.[^11]

Royal monogram

Although nominally a constitutional monarch, in practice Zog retained the dictatorial powers he had enjoyed as president. Thus, in effect, Albania remained a military dictatorship.[^7]

In 1938, as a result of a request from his advisor and friend Constantino Spanchis, Zog opened the borders of Albania to [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish "Jewish") refugees fleeing persecution in [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").[^12]

Although born as an [aristocrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy_\(class\) "Aristocracy (class)") and hereditary [Bey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bey "Bey"), King Zog was somewhat ignored by other monarchs in Europe because he was a self-proclaimed monarch who had no links to any other European royal families. Nonetheless, he did have strong connections with Muslim [royal families](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_families "Royal families") in the [Arab World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_World "Arab World"), particularly [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt "Kingdom of Egypt"), whose [ruling dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Dynasty "Muhammad Ali Dynasty") had Albanian origins. As king, he was honoured by the governments of [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy"), [Luxembourg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg "Luxembourg"), [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt "Kingdom of Egypt"), [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia"), [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), [Romania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania "Kingdom of Romania"), [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Greece "Kingdom of Greece"), [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium"), [Bulgaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bulgaria "Kingdom of Bulgaria"), [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary_\(1920%E2%80%931946\) "Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)"), [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic"), [Czechoslovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Czechoslovak_Republic "First Czechoslovak Republic"), and [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Austrian_Republic "First Austrian Republic").

Zog had been engaged to the daughter of [Shefqet Bey Verlaci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shefqet_Verlaci "Shefqet Verlaci") before he became king. Soon after he became king, however, he broke off the engagement. According to traditional customs of [blood vengeance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud#Albania "Feud") prevalent in Albania at the time, Verlaci had the right and obligation to kill Zog. The king frequently surrounded himself with a personal guard and avoided public appearances. He also feared that he might be poisoned, so the mother of the king assumed supervision of the royal kitchen.[^13]

In April 1938, Zog married [Countess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countess "Countess") [Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Apponyi_de_Nagy-Appony "Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony"), a [Roman Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") [aristocrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy_\(class\) "Aristocracy (class)") who was half- [Hungarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians "Hungarians") and half- [American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans "Americans"). The ceremony was broadcast throughout Tirana via [Radio Tirana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Televizioni_Shqiptar#History "Radio Televizioni Shqiptar") that was officially launched by the monarch five months later. Their only child, [Crown Prince Leka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leka,_Crown_Prince_of_Albania_\(born_1939\) "Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1939)"), was born in Albania on 5 April 1939.

About 600 [blood feuds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjakmarrja "Gjakmarrja") reportedly existed against Zog,[^14] and during his reign he reputedly survived more than 55 assassination attempts.[^15] One of these occurred inside the corridors of the Albanian Parliament premises on 23 February 1924. [Beqir Valteri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beqir_Valteri "Beqir Valteri"), originating from the same area as Zog,[^16] [^17] was waiting for him and opened fire suddenly.[^18] Zog was shot twice. Meanwhile, Valteri fled but, surrounded by the militia, took refuge in one of the bathrooms, refusing to surrender and singing patriotic songs. According to the memoirs of [Ekrem Vlora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekrem_Vlora "Ekrem Vlora"),[^19] he surrendered after the intervention of [Qazim Koculi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_Koculi "Qazim Koculi") and [Ali Klissura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Klissura "Ali Klissura"). Zog stepped down briefly from political activity,[^20] but promised to forgive Valteri. Valteri, a member of the revolutionary *Bashkimi* ("The union") committee led by [Avni Rustemi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avni_Rustemi "Avni Rustemi"),[^21] was set free by the Court of Tirana after declaring that it was an individual act.[^22] Meanwhile, all rumors pointed to the opposition, specifically to Rustemi. Two weeks later Zog and Valteri would meet in private. Soon after, Rustemi would be assassinated.[^19]

Another attempt occurred on 20 February 1931, while Zog was visiting the [Vienna State Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_State_Opera "Vienna State Opera") house for a performance of *[Pagliacci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagliacci "Pagliacci")*.[^13] The attackers ([Aziz Çami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aziz_%C3%87ami "Aziz Çami") and [Ndok Gjeloshi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndok_Gjeloshi "Ndok Gjeloshi")) struck whilst Zog was getting into his car. The attempt was organized by "National Union" ([Albanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language "Albanian language"): *Bashkimi Kombëtar"*),[^23] a union of Zog opponents in exile which was formed in Vienna (1925) with the initiative of [Ali Këlcyra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_K%C3%ABlcyra "Ali Këlcyra"), [Sejfi Vllamasi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejfi_Vllamasi "Sejfi Vllamasi"), [Xhemal Bushati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhemal_Bushati "Xhemal Bushati") etc.[^24] Zog was in the company of Minister [Eqrem Libohova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eqrem_Libohova "Eqrem Libohova"), who was wounded, while Zog's guard Llesh Topallaj was mistaken for Zog by Gjeloshi, and shot three times in the back of the head. Çami's gun was stuck and did not fire. Zog came out of the event unharmed, thanks also to the prompt intervention of Albanian Consul Zef Serreqi and local police.[^15] The Austrian authorities arrested Çami, Gjeloshi, and later [Qazim Mulleti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_Mulleti "Qazim Mulleti"), [Rexhep Mitrovica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexhep_Mitrovica "Rexhep Mitrovica"), [Menduh Angoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menduh_Angoni&action=edit&redlink=1 "Menduh Angoni (page does not exist)"), [Angjelin Suma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angjelin_Suma&action=edit&redlink=1 "Angjelin Suma (page does not exist)"), Luigj Shkurti, [Sejfi Vllamasi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejfi_Vllamasi "Sejfi Vllamasi"), etc.[^15] [^25] All the Albanian political *émigrés* in Vienna were subsequently arrested, beside [Hasan Prishtina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina"). Most of them were quickly released and expelled from Austria. Gjeloshi was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months of jail, while Çami got 2 years and 6 months.[^26]

The fascist government of [Benito Mussolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") 's Italy had supported Zog since early in his presidency; that support had led to increased Italian influence in Albanian affairs. The Italians compelled Zog to refuse to renew the [First Treaty of Tirana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Treaty_of_Tirana "First Treaty of Tirana") (1926), although Zog still retained British officers in the [Gendarmerie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albanian_Gendarmerie "Royal Albanian Gendarmerie") as a counterbalance against the Italians, who had pressured Zog to remove them.

During the [worldwide depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") of the early 1930s, Zog's government became almost completely dependent on Mussolini. Grain had to be imported, many Albanians emigrated, and Italians were allowed to settle in Albania. In 1932 and 1933, Albania could not pay the interest on its loans from the Society for the Economic Development of Albania, and the Italians used this as a pretext for further dominance. They demanded that Tirana put Italians in charge of the Gendarmerie, join Italy in a customs union, and grant the Italian Kingdom control of Albania's sugar, telegraph, and electrical monopolies. Finally, Italy called for the Albanian government to establish teaching of the [Italian language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") in all Albanian schools, a demand that was swiftly refused by Zog. In defiance of Italian demands, he ordered the national budget to be slashed by 30 percent, dismissed all Italian military advisers, and nationalized Italian-run Roman Catholic schools in the north of Albania to decrease Italian influence on the population of Albania. In 1934, he tried without success to build ties with [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), and the [Balkan states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_states "Balkan states"). Albania then drifted back into the Italian orbit.[^27]

Two days after the birth of Zog's son and heir apparent, on 7 April 1939 ([Good Friday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday "Good Friday")), Mussolini's [Italy invaded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_invasion_of_Albania "Italian invasion of Albania"), facing no significant resistance. The Albanian army was ill-equipped to resist, as it was almost entirely dominated by Italian advisors and officers and was no match for the Italian Army. The Italians were, however, resisted by small elements in the gendarmerie and general population. The royal family, realising that their lives were in danger, fled into exile, taking with them a considerable amount of gold from the [National Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Albania "National Bank of Albania") of [Tirana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana "Tirana") and [Durrës](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs "Durrës").[^28] [^29] Since the royal family had expected an Italian invasion, the gathering of gold had started in advance.[^30] "Oh God, it was so short" were King Zog's last words to Geraldine on Albanian soil. Mussolini declared [Albania a protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_\(1939%E2%80%931943\) "Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)") under Italy's King [Victor Emmanuel III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_III "Victor Emmanuel III"). While some Albanians continued to resist, "a large part of the population... welcomed the Italians with cheers", according to one contemporary account.[^31]

Prior to the birth of Prince Leka, the position of [heir presumptive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_presumptive "Heir presumptive") was held by [Tati Esad Murad Kryziu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tati_Esad_Murad_Kryziu "Tati Esad Murad Kryziu"), Prince of [Kosova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo "Kosovo"), who was born on the 24th of December 1923 in Tirana, and who was the son of the King's sister, Princess Nafije. He became an honorary General of the [Royal Albanian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albanian_Army "Royal Albanian Army") in 1928, at age five. He was made Heir Presumptive with the style of His Highness and title of "Prince of Kosova" (*Princ i Kosovës*) in 1931. After the royal house's exile, he moved to France, where he died in August 1993, aged 69.

The royal family fled to [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Greece "Kingdom of Greece"). Zog, speaking a few days after his arrival there, characterized Hitler and Mussolini as madmen facing "two fools who sleep": [Chamberlain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain "Neville Chamberlain") and [Daladier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edouard_Daladier "Edouard Daladier"). Zog went on to declare, "We prefer to die, from the littlest child to the oldest man, to show our independence is not for sale." The world, aware that Zog and his entourage had carried off most of the Albanian treasury's gold, was not impressed.[^32] After a short stay in Greece, the Zog party went to [Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul") in [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), then fled through [Romania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania "Kingdom of Romania"), [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic"), [Latvia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia "Latvia"), [Sweden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), [Norway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway"), [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium") to [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"). Zog and his family lived a time in France and fled when the [Germans invaded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France "Battle of France"). Their escape from France was helped by [Prince Mehmed Orhan Osmanoğlu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_Orhan "Mehmed Orhan") from the [Ottoman Imperial Dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_dynasty "Ottoman dynasty"), who was [aide-de-camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide-de-camp "Aide-de-camp") of Zog I.[^33] [^34]

The royal family then settled in England. Their first residence was at [The Ritz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritz_London_Hotel "The Ritz London Hotel") in London. This was followed in 1941 by a brief stay at Forest Ridge, a house in the [South Ascot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ascot "South Ascot") area of [Sunninghill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunninghill,_Berkshire "Sunninghill, Berkshire") in [Berkshire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire "Berkshire"), near where Zog's nieces had been at school in [Ascot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot,_Berkshire "Ascot, Berkshire"). In 1941 they moved to Parmoor House, [Parmoor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmoor "Parmoor"), near [Frieth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieth "Frieth") in Buckinghamshire, with some staff of the court living in locations around Lane End.[^35]

In 1946, Zog and most of his family left England and went to live in [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt "Kingdom of Egypt") at the behest of [King Farouk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Farouk "King Farouk"). In 1951, Zog bought the [Knollwood estate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knollwood_estate "Knollwood estate") in [Muttontown, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttontown,_New_York "Muttontown, New York"), [Long Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island "Long Island") but the sixty-room estate was never occupied; it quickly fell into ruin and Zog sold the estate in 1955. Farouk [was overthrown in 1952](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Egypt "Revolution of Egypt"), and the family left for France in 1955.

He made his final home in France, where he died at the [Foch Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foch_Hospital "Foch Hospital"), [Suresnes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresnes "Suresnes"), Hauts-de-Seine on 9 April 1961, aged 65, of an undisclosed condition. Zog was said to have regularly smoked 200 cigarettes a day, giving him a possible claim to the title of the world's heaviest smoker in 1929,[^36] but had been seriously ill for some time. He was survived by his wife and son, and was initially buried at the [cimetière parisien de Thiais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_parisien_de_Thiais "Cimetière parisien de Thiais"), near Paris. On his death, his son Leka was pronounced H. M. King Leka of the Albanians by the exiled Albanian community.[^37]

His widow, Geraldine, died of natural causes in 2002 at the age of 87 [^37] in a military hospital in [Tirana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana "Tirana").

During [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), three resistance groups were [operating in Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_in_Albania "World War II in Albania"): the [nationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balli_Komb%C3%ABtar "Balli Kombëtar"), the [royalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_Movement "Legality Movement") and the [communists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Movement_\(Albania\) "National Liberation Movement (Albania)"). Some of the Albanian establishment opted for [collaboration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Albania "German occupation of Albania"). The communist partisans refused to co-operate with the other resistance groups and eventually [took control of the country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Government_of_Albania "Democratic Government of Albania"). They were able to defeat the Nazi remnants and had full control of Albania in November 1944.

Zog attempted to reclaim his throne after the war. However, when the communist government, successful in its partisan movement, seized power, one of its first acts was to ban Zog from ever returning to Albania. It formally deposed him in 1946.

In 1952, his representatives met with the representatives of the Yugoslavian government over possible collaboration.[^38] Sponsored by [MI6](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service "Secret Intelligence Service") and the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency"), some forces loyal to Zog attempted to mount [infiltrations into the country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Subversion "Albanian Subversion"), but most were ambushed due to intelligence sent to the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") by spy [Kim Philby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Philby "Kim Philby").

A referendum in 1997 – seven years after the end of Communist rule – proposed to restore the monarchy in the person of Zog's son [Leka Zogu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leka_Zogu "Leka Zogu") who, since 1961, had been styled "Leka I, King of the Albanians". The official but disputed results stated that about two-thirds of voters favoured a continued republican government. Leka, believing the result to be fraudulent, attempted an armed uprising: he was unsuccessful and was forced into exile, although he later returned and lived in Tirana until his death on 30 November 2011. A main street in Tirana was later renamed " [Boulevard Zog I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zogu_I_Boulevard "Zogu I Boulevard") " by the Albanian government.

In October 2012, the government of Albania decided to bring back the remains of the former king from France, where he died in 1961. Zog's body was exhumed from the [Thiais Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_parisien_de_Thiais "Cimetière parisien de Thiais"), Paris on 15 November 2012.[^39] A [guard of honour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour "Guard of honour") was provided by the French President, in the form of [French Legionnaires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion "French Foreign Legion") in ceremonial dress.

Zog's remains were returned in a state ceremony on 17 November 2012, coinciding with celebrations for [Albania's independence centennial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/100th_Anniversary_of_the_Independence_of_Albania "100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania"). The bodies of the king and his family members now lie in the reconstructed [royal mausoleum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_the_Albanian_Royal_Family "Mausoleum of the Albanian Royal Family") in the capital Tirana.[^40] The interment was attended by the government of Albania, including the President and Prime Minister, and representatives of the former royal families of Romania, Montenegro, Russia and Albania.

Zog's name was in use by 1972 in the English language [palaeontological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeontological "Palaeontological") [mnemonic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") for the names of [zonal index fossils](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fossils "Index fossils") in part of the [Lower Carboniferous System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous_System "Carboniferous System") of Great Britain (namely **C** leistopora, which geologists decided to call 'zone k', **Z** aphrentis, **C** aninia, **S** eminula and **D** ibanophylum): " **K** ing **Z** og **c** aught **s** yphilis and **d** ied".[^45]

In the [James Bond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond "James Bond") novel *[The Man with the Golden Gun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Gun_\(novel\) "The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)")*, [Ian Fleming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fleming "Ian Fleming") writes of the villainous [Francisco Scaramanga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Scaramanga "Francisco Scaramanga") telling his compatriots that the [Rastafari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari "Rastafari") of [Jamaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica "Jamaica") "believes it owes allegiance" to the King of [Ethiopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia"), this "King Zog or what-have-you." Fleming had been assigned with the task of escorting Zog when in exile after Albania was annexed by Italy.

In *[Aria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_\(1987_film\) "Aria (1987 film)")*, a 1987 British anthology film, Zog was a character in the first of ten short self-contained segments, each by a different director and each featuring a different opera aria. This segment, entitled ' [Un ballo in maschera](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092580/) ' after the [Giuseppe Verdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi "Giuseppe Verdi") opera, was directed by [Nicolas Roeg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg "Nicolas Roeg"), with actor [Theresa Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_Russell "Theresa Russell") playing King Zog during a fictionalized account of his visit to Vienna in 1931 and the assassination attempt on the steps of that city's opera house (as noted earlier, Zog had actually seen a performance of 'Pagliacci' before the real attack).

In the "new" [Doc Savage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Savage "Doc Savage") pulp fiction novel, The Whistling Wraith (July 1993, Bantam/Spectra), from the original notes of [Lester Dent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Dent "Lester Dent") (primary writer of the sagas) but now completed as a novel by Will Murray, the life & person of Zog, as well as Albania's political problems and foreign policy issues with Mussolini's Italy are key to the plot. The story slots into the Doc Savage timeline in 1938 (a few weeks after The Motion Menace, per p. 61). Egil Goz the First is clearly standing in for King Zog I, for both are Muslims and both were first president before being the first king of their Balkan nation. (Italy is Santa Bellanca, which is behaving badly in Africa in the work, a tie to the invasion and conquest of Ethiopia.)

In episode 13 of [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus "Monty Python's Flying Circus") he is mentioned as a reporter for made-up news show called ProbeAround but suddenly dies.

[^1]: Though Zog I was only formally deposed on the 2nd of January 1946, he enjoyed little recognition after the occupation of Albania by Italy. He was not welcomed as a royal when he arrived in England. The UK refused to form an Albanian government in exile and supported Hoxha and the communist partisans against Nazi Germany and Italy after 1944.

Mungonte vetëm Qeveria, pra edhe Kryeministri Ahmet Zogu. Unë rrija si gjithmonë pranë metropolitit Fan Noli, në bankën e radhës së parë pranë hyrjes. Më ra në sy se atë ditë, grupi i Partisë Demokratike prapa meje po rrinte çuditërisht i heshtur dhe i merakosur. Befas ushtuan dy krisma në shkallët e ndërtesës, që u pasuan nga një qetësi e ngrirë. Pastaj u hapën me vrull dyert e sallës dhe brenda hyri Ahmet Zogu me revolver në dorë. Ai ishte prerë në fytyrë, por ecte me shtatin drejt dhe pas disa çastesh e mori veten, madje buzëqeshi dhe vajti me çap të sigurt tek bangoja e qeverisë, ku u ul në një vend të caktuar për sekretarët...  
Ahmet Zogu që ishte paralajmëruar për atentatin 2 javë më parë arriti të mësonte se Valteri ishte i shtyrë nga kundërshtarët e tij. Kujtimet e shumë protagonistëve të kohës, shënojnë faktin që ai u takua edhe vetë kokë më kokë me atentatorin. Në fakt atentati i Zogut përflitej në çdo kafene të Tiranës dhe njerëzit e tij, vunë gishtin mbi Avni Rustemin si organizator.
