## Installation

### For KDE Plasma Desktop:

1. `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/catppuccin/kde catppuccin-kde && cd catppuccin-kde`
2. Run the install script using `./install.sh` and follow the instructions.

### For Krita:

1. Download the colour-scheme zip file for your preferred flavour from the [release](https://github.com/catppuccin/kde/releases/) tab.
2. Extract the file and move the theme(s) you wish to install into the following folders for your platform: Windows: `%appdata%\krita\color-schemes`  
	Linux: `~/.local/share/krita/color-schemes`
3. Open Krita, and you can choose the theme from Settings > Themes.

## Notes

1. If you are using KDE 5.27 or below, you might want to run `git checkout v0.2.5` before running the install script to avoid running into compatibility issues. Alternatively, the release binaries are available .
2. If you encounter an error similar to 'connection refused' while running the installation script, it may be due to store.kde.org being down or issues with your internet connection.
