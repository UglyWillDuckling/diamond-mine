**Handala** ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): حنظلة, [romanized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): *Ḥanẓala*), also **Handhala**, **Hanzala** or **Hanthala**, is a prominent [national symbol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbol "National symbol") and [personification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_personification "National personification") of the [Palestinian people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people "Palestinian people").[^1] [^2]

The character was created in 1969 by [political cartoonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_cartoon "Political cartoon") [Naji al-Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naji_al-Ali "Naji al-Ali"), and first took its current form in 1973. Handala became the signature of Naji al-Ali's cartoons and remains an iconic symbol of Palestinian identity and defiance. The character has been described as "portraying war, resistance, and the Palestinian identity with astounding clarity".[^3]

The name comes from the Arabic word for the [colocynth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocynth "Colocynth") (حنظل, *ḥanẓal*), a [perennial plant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant "Perennial plant") native to the [Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant") which bears bitter fruit, grows back when cut, and has deep roots.[^4]

Handala's impact has continued in the decades after al-Ali's 1987 assassination; today the character remains widely popular as a representative of the Palestinian people, and is found on numerous walls and buildings throughout the [West Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") (notably as [West Bank Wall graffiti art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_Wall_graffiti_art "West Bank Wall graffiti art")), [Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") and other [Palestinian refugee camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugee_camps "Palestinian refugee camps"), and as a popular tattoo and jewellery motif. It has also been used by movements such as [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions") and the [Iranian Green Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Green_Movement "Iranian Green Movement").[^4]

Handala appeared for the first time on Kuwaiti newspaper *[Al-Seyassah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Seyassah "Al-Seyassah")* on 13 July 1969,[^1] and first turned his back to the viewer and clasped his hands behind his back from 1973 onwards.[^5]

## Symbolism

Handala's age – ten years old – represents Naji al-Ali's age in 1948 when [he was forced to leave Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight"); Handala will not grow up until he can [return to his homeland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_return_to_Israel "Palestinian return to Israel").[^6] Al-Ali wrote:

> Handala was born 10 years old and he will always be 10 years old. It was at that age that I left my homeland. When Handala returns, he will still be 10 years old, and then he will start growing up.

His posture, with his turned back and clasped hands, symbolises the character's "rejection at a time when solutions are presented to us the American way" and as "a symbol of rejection of all the present negative tides in our region." [^4] His ragged clothes and standing barefoot symbolise his allegiance to the poor.[^4] Al-Ali described Handala as "the symbol of a just cause":

> He was the arrow of the compass, pointing steadily towards Palestine. Not just Palestine in geographical terms, but Palestine in its humanitarian sense—the symbol of a just cause, whether it is located in Egypt, Vietnam or South Africa.[^6]

## Legacy

[West Bank Wall graffiti art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_Wall_graffiti_art "West Bank Wall graffiti art") in [Bethlehem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem"): Handala and [Liberty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty "Statue of Liberty") as " [Pietà](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0 "Pietà") "

Al-Ali stated in an interview prior to his assassination that: "Handala, whom I created, will not end after I die. I hope that this is not an exaggeration when I say that I will continue to live in Handala, even after I die". Current usages of the Handala motif include:

- [Graffiti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti "Graffiti") on numerous walls, buildings and souvenir shops throughout the [West Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") (notably [West Bank Wall graffiti art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_Wall_graffiti_art "West Bank Wall graffiti art")), [Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") and other [Palestinian refugee camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees") [^4]
- A primary symbol of the [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions") movement [^4]
- A popular tattoo and jewellery motif [^4]
- The web mascot of the [Iranian Green Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Green_Movement "Iranian Green Movement") [^7]
- In Israeli artwork, particular alongside the Israeli character [Srulik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srulik "Srulik") [^8]
- The ship used in the [July 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2025_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "July 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla") which challenged the [Israeli naval blockade of Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Gaza_Strip "Blockade of Gaza Strip") was named after it.
