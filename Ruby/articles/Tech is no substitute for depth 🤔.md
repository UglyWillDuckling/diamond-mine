Hey friends,

It's safe to say that **technology** has enabled a lot of good things for us. For one, we wouldn’t be together here in this inbox without it. We wouldn’t be able to send pictures to our loved ones in faraway places without it. If anything, the chief benefit of technology is its ability to sustain human connection across space and time.

But the trade-off is that it tends to cheapen that connection, turning our relationships into mere bits that require minimal effort to sustain.

In today’s reflection, I want to dig into why this happens, and how my own experience as a writer has helped me navigate this conundrum. Because while technology promises a more connected world, the reality is that it has contributed to a lonelier one. And the first step to pivoting back toward its initial promise is to be aware of how it went astray.

When you’re ready, let’s dive right in:

Draw Your Words: A More To That course

Drawings are a cheat code for any writer, and I still feel like they’re underutilized. When you draw illustrations to complement your writing, it gives your words an immediate visual identity, which makes it stand out right away.

That’s why I created a comprehensive course on drawing, and as a newsletter reader, you can get it at a discount for a limited time (it’s usually $150, but just $99 for today).

You might think that AI can do the work for you, but the truth is that people can tell. An AI-generated image in a post isn’t fooling anybody; everyone knows it didn’t come from your hands.

The best way to build a visual identity around your writing is to create it yourself. But instead of scouring the web for tutorials, I’ve distilled everything you need to know about drawing in a simple package that you can reference at any time.
