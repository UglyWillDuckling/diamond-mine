The ***Whole Earth Catalog*** (**WEC**) was an American [counterculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s") magazine and product catalog published by author [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand") several times a year between 1968 and 1972, and occasionally thereafter, until 1998.

The magazine featured essays and articles, but was primarily focused on product reviews. The editorial focus was on [self-sufficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sufficiency "Self-sufficiency"), [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology"), [alternative education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_education "Alternative education"), "[do it yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself "Do it yourself")" (DIY), and [holism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism "Holism"), and featured the slogan "access to tools". While WEC listed and reviewed a wide range of products (clothing, books, tools, machines, seeds, etc.), it did not sell any of the products directly. Instead, the vendor's contact information was listed alongside the item and its review. This is why, while not a regularly published periodical, numerous editions and updates were required to keep price and availability information up to date.

In his 2005 Stanford University [commencement speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech "Commencement speech"), [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs") compared *The Whole Earth Catalog* to "a sort of [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") in paperback form, before Google came along."

Stewart Brand in 2010

The title *Whole Earth Catalog* came from a previous project by [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand"). In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") release the then-rumored [satellite photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_photo "Satellite photo") of the sphere of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") as seen from space, one of the [first images of the "Whole Earth"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_images_of_Earth_from_space "First images of Earth from space"). He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people. The [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford "Stanford")\-educated Brand, a biologist with strong artistic and social interests, believed that there was a groundswell of commitment to thoroughly renovating American industrial society along ecologically and socially just lines, whatever they might prove to be.

Andrew Kirk in *Counterculture Green* notes that the *Whole Earth Catalog* was preceded by the "Whole Earth Truck Store" which was a 1963 [Dodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge "Dodge") truck. In 1968, Brand, who was then 29, and his wife Lois embarked "on a commune road trip" with the truck, hoping to tour the country doing educational fairs. The truck was not only a store, but also an alternative lending library and a mobile microeducation service.[^kirk48-1]

[Kevin Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_\(editor\) "Kevin Kelly (editor)"), who would edit later editions of the catalog, summarizes the very early history this way:

> 'Here's a tool that will make drilling a well, or grinding flour, easier,' Brand would tell \[the hippies,\] pointing it out in his catalog of recommended tools. But his best selling tool was the catalog itself, annotated by him, featuring tools that didn't fit into his truck.[^kelly4-2]

The "Truck Store" finally settled into its permanent location in [Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California "Menlo Park, California"), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California").[^3] Instead of bringing the store to the people, Brand decided to create "accumulatively larger versions of his tool catalog"[^kelly4-2] and sell it by mail so the people could contact the vendors directly.

Using the most basic typesetting and page-layout tools, Brand and his colleagues created the first issue of *The Whole Earth Catalog* in 1968. In subsequent issues, its production values gradually improved. Its outsize pages measured 11×14 inches (28×36 cm). Later editions were more than an inch thick. The early editions were published by the [Portola Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portola_Institute "Portola Institute"), headed by [Richard Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Raymond_\(publisher\) "Richard Raymond (publisher)"). The so-called *Last Whole Earth Catalog* (June 1971) won the first U.S. [National Book Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Book_Award "National Book Award") in the [Contemporary Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_winners_of_the_National_Book_Award#Contemporary "List of winners of the National Book Award") category.[^nba1972-4] It was the first time a catalog had ever won such an award. Brand's intent with the catalog was to provide [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education") and "access to tools" so a reader could "find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested."[^5]

[J. Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Baldwin "J. Baldwin") was a young designer and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay: [San Francisco State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_State_University "San Francisco State University") (then San Francisco State College), the [San Francisco Art Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Art_Institute "San Francisco Art Institute"), and the [California College of the Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_College_of_the_Arts "California College of the Arts") (then California College of Arts and Crafts). As he recalled in the film *Ecological Design* (1994), "Stewart Brand came to me because he heard that I read catalogs. He said, 'I want to make this thing called a "whole Earth" catalog so that anyone on Earth can pick up a telephone and find out the complete information on anything. ... That's my goal.'" Baldwin served as the chief editor of subjects in the areas of technology and design, both in the catalog itself and in other publications which arose from it.

True to his 1966 vision, Brand's publishing efforts were suffused with an awareness of the importance of [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology"), both as a field of study and as an influence upon the future of humankind and emerging human awareness.

From the opening page of the 1969 *Catalog*:

> Function
> 
> The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG functions as an evaluation and access device. With it, the user should know better what is worth getting and where and how to do the getting.
> 
> An item is listed in the CATALOG if it is deemed:
> 
> 1. Useful as a tool,
> 2. Relevant to independent education,
> 3. High quality or low cost,
> 4. Not already common knowledge,
> 5. Easily available by mail.
> 
> CATALOG listings are continually revised according to the experience and suggestions of CATALOG users and staff.
> 
> Purpose
> 
> We **are** as gods and might as well get good at it.[^6] So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested. Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.

The 1968 catalog divided itself into seven broad sections:

- Understanding Whole Systems
- Shelter and Land Use
- Industry and Craft
- Communications
- Community
- Nomadics
- Learning

Within each section, the best tools and books the editors could find were collected and listed, along with images, reviews and uses, prices, and suppliers. The reader was also able to order some items directly through the catalog.

Later editions changed a few of the headings, but generally kept the same overall framework.

The *Catalog* used a broad definition of "tools". There were informative tools, such as books, maps, professional journals, courses, and classes. There were well-designed special-purpose utensils, including garden tools, carpenters' and masons' tools, welding equipment, chainsaws, fiberglass materials, tents, hiking shoes, and potters' wheels. There were even early synthesizers and personal computers.

The *Catalog'*s publication coincided with a great wave of convention-challenging experimentalism and a do-it-yourself attitude associated with "the counterculture," and tended to appeal not only to the intelligentsia of the movement, but to creative, hands-on, and outdoorsy people of many stripes. Some of the ideas in the *Catalog* were developed during Brand's visits to [Drop City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_City "Drop City").

With the *Catalog* opened flat, the reader might find the large page on the left full of text and intriguing illustrations from a volume of [Joseph Needham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham "Joseph Needham")'s *[Science and Civilization in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_Civilisation_in_China "Science and Civilisation in China")*, showing and explaining an astronomical clock tower or a chain-pump windmill, while on the right-hand page are a review of a beginners' guide to modern technology (*The Way Things Work*) and a review of *The Engineers' Illustrated Thesaurus*. On another spread, the verso reviews books on accounting and moonlighting jobs, while the recto bears an article in which people tell the story of a community credit union they founded. Another pair of pages depict and discuss different kayaks, inflatable dinghies, and houseboats.

## Publication after 1972

The catalog was published sporadically after 1972. An important shift in philosophy in the *Catalogs* occurred in the early 1970s, when Brand decided that the early stance of emphasizing individualism should be replaced with one favoring *community*. He had originally written that "a realm of intimate, personal power is developing"; regarding this as important in some respects (to wit, the soon-emerging potentials of personal computing), Brand felt that the overarching project of humankind had more to do with living within natural systems, and this is something we do in common, interactively.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2008)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The broad interpretation of "tool" coincided with that given by the designer, philosopher, and engineer [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller "Buckminster Fuller"), though another thinker admired by Brand and some of his cohorts was [Lewis Mumford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Mumford "Lewis Mumford"), who had written about words as tools. Early editions reflected the considerable influence of Fuller, particularly his teachings about "[whole systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory")," "[synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_\(Fuller\) "Synergetics (Fuller)")," and efficiency or reducing waste. By 1971, Brand and his co-workers were already questioning whether Fuller's sense of direction might be too anthropocentric. New information arising in fields like ecology and biospherics was persuasive.

By the mid-1970s, much of the [Buddhist economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_economics "Buddhist economics") viewpoint of [E. F. Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher "E. F. Schumacher"), as well as the activist interests of the biological species [preservationists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism "Environmentalism"), had tempered the overall enthusiasm for Fuller's ideas in the catalog.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2008)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Still later, the amiable-architecture ideas of people like [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander "Christopher Alexander") and similar community-planning ideas of people like [Peter Calthorpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Calthorpe "Peter Calthorpe") further tempered the engineering-efficiency tone of Fuller's ideas.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2008)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The *Whole Earth Epilog* published in 1974 was intended as a "volume 2" to the *Last Whole Earth Catalog*, which itself was revised as *The (Updated) Last Whole Earth Catalog* in 1975.

*The Next Whole Earth Catalog* ([ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_\(identifier\) "ISBN (identifier)") [0-394-70776-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-394-70776-1 "Special:BookSources/0-394-70776-1")) in 1980 was well received, and an updated second edition followed in 1981. The 1980s also saw two editions of the *Whole Earth Software Catalog*, a compendium for which [Doubleday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleday_\(publisher\) "Doubleday (publisher)") had bid $1.4 million for the trade paperback rights.[^7] The 1986 publication of *The Essential Whole Earth Catalog* ([ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_\(identifier\) "ISBN (identifier)") [0-385-23641-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-385-23641-7 "Special:BookSources/0-385-23641-7")) preceded the 1989 *Electronic Whole Earth Catalog* on CD-ROM, which used [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard "HyperCard"), an early form of hypermedia developed by [Apple Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.").[^8][^mania-9] Dedicated editions were published for communications tools *Signal* in 1988, [new age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_age "New age") topics *The Fringes of Reason* in 1989, and ecological matters *Whole Earth Ecolog* in 1990.

Published in 1994, *The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog* ([ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_\(identifier\) "ISBN (identifier)") [0-06-251059-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-06-251059-2 "Special:BookSources/0-06-251059-2")) was subtitled *Access to Tools and Ideas for the Twenty-First Century*.

A slender *30th Anniversary Celebration* was published in 1998 as part of Issue 95 of the *Whole Earth* magazine ([ISSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSN_\(identifier\) "ISSN (identifier)") [0749-5056](https://www.worldcat.org/search?fq=x0:jrnl&q=n2:0749-5056)), reprinting the original *WEC* along with new material. An important edit to this reprint was a limitation placed by book publishers who "begged" the Catalog not to promote titles they no longer carry.[^10] All such information was placed at the back of the catalog, hampering a valuable Catalog function: nudging publishers to keep seminal works [in print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_print "In print").

Three books were serialized in the pages of the WEC, printing a couple of paragraphs per page. This made reading the catalog a page-by-page experience.

[Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs") compared *The Whole Earth Catalog* to Internet search engine [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") in his June 2005 Stanford University [commencement speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech "Commencement speech").

> When I was young, there was an amazing publication called *The Whole Earth Catalog*, which was one of the bibles of my generation ... It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Then at the very end of this commencement speech Jobs quotes explicitly the farewell message placed on the back cover of the last 1974 edition of the *Catalog* (#1180 October 1974 titled *Whole Earth Epilog*[^18]) and makes it his own final recommendation: "Stay hungry. Stay foolish."[^19][^jobs-20][^21]

*[Earthrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise "Earthrise")*, by [William Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Anders "William Anders"), [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8"), 1968, the cover photo of the second and third editions.

In 2009, [Kevin Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_\(editor\) "Kevin Kelly (editor)") stated:

> For this new [countercultural movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s"), information was a precious commodity. In the '60s, there was no Internet; no 500 cable channels. ... \[The *WEC*\] was a great example of [user-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content "User-generated content"), without advertising, before the Internet. Basically, Brand invented the [blogosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere "Blogosphere") long before there was any such thing as a [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog "Blog"). ... No topic was too esoteric, no degree of enthusiasm too ardent, no amateur expertise too uncertified to be included. ... This I am sure about: it is no coincidence that the *Whole Earth Catalogs* disappeared as soon as the web and blogs arrived. Everything the *Whole Earth Catalogs* did, the web does better.[^22]

Looking back and discussing attitudes evident in the early editions of the catalog, Brand wrote, "At a time when the [New Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left "New Left") was calling for [grassroots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots "Grassroots") *political* (i.e., referred) power, *Whole Earth* eschewed politics and pushed grass-roots *direct* power—tools and skills."[^23]

As an early indicator of the general Zeitgeist, the catalog's first edition preceded the original [Earth Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day "Earth Day") by nearly two years. The idea of Earth Day occurred to Senator [Gaylord Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaylord_Nelson "Gaylord Nelson"), its instigator, "in the summer of 1969 while on a conservation speaking tour out west," where the [Sierra Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club "Sierra Club") was active, and where young minds had been broadened and stimulated by such influences as the catalog.

Despite this popular and critical success, particularly among a generation of young hippies and survivalists, the catalog was not intended to continue in publication for long, just long enough for the editors to complete a good overview of the available tools and resources, and for the word, and copies, to get out to everyone who needed them.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Spin-offs and inspirations

From 1974 to 2003, the Whole Earth principals published a magazine, known originally as *[CoEvolution Quarterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoEvolution_Quarterly "CoEvolution Quarterly")*. When the short-lived *[Whole Earth Software Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_and_Review "Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review")* (a supplement to *The [Whole Earth Software Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_and_Review "Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review")*) failed, it was merged in 1985 with *[CoEvolution Quarterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoEvolution_Quarterly "CoEvolution Quarterly")* to form the *[Whole Earth Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Review "Whole Earth Review")* (edited at different points by [Jay Kinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Kinney "Jay Kinney"), [Kevin Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_\(editor\) "Kevin Kelly (editor)"), and [Howard Rheingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Rheingold "Howard Rheingold")), later called *Whole Earth Magazine* and finally just *Whole Earth*. The last issue, number 111 (edited by [Alex Steffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Steffen "Alex Steffen")), was meant to be published in Spring 2003, but funds ran out. The [Point Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Foundation_\(environment\) "Point Foundation (environment)"), which owned *Whole Earth*, closed its doors later that year. <sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2008)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The Whole Earth website[^24] continues the *WEC* legacy of concepts in popular discourse, medical self-care, community building, bioregionalism, environmental restoration, nanotechnology, and cyberspace. As of January 2022, the website appears to be offline.

Recognizing the "developed country" focus of the original WEC, groups in several developing countries have created "catalogs" of their own to be more relevant to their countries. One such effort was an adaptation of the WEC (called the "Liklik Buk") written and published in the late 1970s in Papua New Guinea; by 1982 this had been enlarged, updated, and translated (as "Save Na Mekem") into the [Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin "Pidgin") language used throughout [Melanesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesia "Melanesia"), and updates of the English "Liklik Buk" were published in 1986 and 2003.

In the United States, the book *Domebook One* was a direct spin-off of the WEC. [Lloyd Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Kahn "Lloyd Kahn"), Shelter editor of the WEC, borrowed WEC production equipment for a week in 1970 and produced the first book on building [geodesic domes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_domes "Geodesic domes"). A year later, in 1971, Kahn again borrowed WEC equipment (an [IBM Selectric Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter#The_Selectric_as_computer_terminal "IBM Selectric typewriter") typesetting machine and a Polaroid MP-5 camera on an easel), and spent a month in the Santa Barbara Mountains producing *Domebook 2*, which went on to sell 165,000 copies. With production of DB 2, Kahn and his company Shelter Publications followed Stewart Brand's move to nationwide distribution by [Random House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_House "Random House").[^25]

In 1973, Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie are part of a research project at Berkeley University[^26] and publish a feminist catalog inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, the [New Woman's Survival Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Woman%27s_Survival_Catalog "New Woman's Survival Catalog"),[^27] which gathers feminist initiatives in different domains (art, communication, work, money, [self-help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help "Self-help"), self-defense...) in the USA.

In 1969, a store which was inspired by (but not financially connected with) *The Whole Earth Catalog,* called the [Whole Earth Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Access "Whole Earth Access") opened in [Berkeley, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California "Berkeley, California"). It closed in 1998. In 1970 a store called the "Whole Earth Provision Co.", inspired by the catalog, opened in Austin, Texas.[^28] It has six stores in Austin, Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio.

In late 2006, [Worldchanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldchanging "Worldchanging") released their 600-page compendium of solutions, *[Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldchanging_\(book\) "Worldchanging (book)")*, which [Bill McKibben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben "Bill McKibben"), in an article in the *[New York Review of Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Review_of_Books "New York Review of Books")* called "The Whole Earth Catalog retooled for the iPod generation."[^29] The editor of Worldchanging has since acknowledged the Catalog as a prime inspiration.[^30][^31]

*Whole Arctic Catalog* was written by Pamela Richot and Published in *Backet 3: At Extremes* in 2015 to draw attention to threats to the arctic region specifically, similarly to how *The Whole Earth Catalog* drew attention to global environmental threats.[^32]

Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds publishes a *Whole Seed Catalog,* with a title and cover image inspired by the *Whole Earth Catalog*.[^33]

Kevin Kelly, mentioned above for his role in editing later editions of the *Whole Earth Catalog*, maintains a web site—Cool-Tools.org—that publishes reviews of "the best/cheapest tools available. Tools are defined broadly as anything that can be useful. This includes hand tools, machines, books, software, gadgets, websites, maps, and even ideas." He also published a large format book in 2013—*Cool Tools A Catalog of Possibilities*[^kelly4-2]—which draws on the many reviews published over the years on that web site. The format, size, and style of the book reflect and pay homage to the original *Whole Earth Catalog*.

In 1970, on April Fool's Day, the Whole Earth Restaurant opened at [UC Santa Cruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Santa_Cruz "UC Santa Cruz"). It was an early source of "whole foods" in Northern California until it closed in 2002.[^34]

In 1972 Warner Bros. Records release a 2 disc sample album *The Whole Burbank Catalog*. The cover parodied the publication's artwork.

The WEC is mentioned in the song "Country Man," the title track from the 1972 debut album by Canadian musician [Valdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdy "Valdy"): "Feed the cat, feed the dog, feed the chickens, chop the log / Have a smoke and clear the fog, read the *Whole Earth Catalog*."

A 2010 issue of the political art magazine made by the [Adbusters Media Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adbusters "Adbusters") was titled *The Whole Brain Catalog*, which features a parody cover with a small human brain in place of the earth, and many references to the 1960s counter culture movement. The tagline read *Access to Therapies* rather than *Access to Tools*.[^35]

On April 17, 2018, [My Morning Jacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Morning_Jacket "My Morning Jacket") frontman [Jim James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_James "Jim James") announced the release of his third solo album *[Uniform Distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Distortion "Uniform Distortion")*, which he stated was inspired by *The* *Whole Earth Catalog.*[^36]

Stewart Brand and *The Whole Earth Catalog* are both subjects of interest to scholars. Notable examples include works by [Theodore Roszak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roszak_\(scholar\) "Theodore Roszak (scholar)"), [Howard Rheingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Rheingold "Howard Rheingold"), [Fred Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Turner_\(academic\) "Fred Turner (academic)"), [John Markoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Markoff "John Markoff"), Andrew Kirk, Sam Binkley and Felicity Scott. The [Stanford University Library System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_Libraries_and_Academic_Information_Resources "Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources") has a *Whole Earth* archive in its Department of Special Collections.[^37]
