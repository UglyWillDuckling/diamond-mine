**Last Gasp at Calama** is the third song on *[Songs for Pierre Chuvin](https://themountaingoats.fandom.com/wiki/Songs_for_Pierre_Chuvin "Songs for Pierre Chuvin")*.

## ```
Out in the street
Free and young
Songs of the Great God
Wild on my tongue
Here come the new guys again
Humorless men
Let he who's without sin
Throw the first one, like you said
Let anyone else throw the second
As long as it connects with your head

One summer, then all of this is gone
One more summer, then no more swan

Hand me a torch why not
Let's get some kicks in while the flame's still hot
They'll do what they were gonna do anyway
But Carthage may rise again one day
"With the measure that you used, so shall it be measured to you,"
So you say, and it's true

One summer, then all of this is gone
One more summer, then no more swan
```
