about:: [[Schmitt trigger]]

The Schmitt trigger does not have memory in the classical sense, but it does have a form of "memory" known as [[hysteresis]].

A Schmitt trigger is a type of comparator circuit that has two threshold voltages: a high threshold (Vt+) and a low threshold (Vt-). When the input signal is above Vt+, the output is high, and when the input signal is below Vt-, the output is low.

Here's the important part: when the input signal is between Vt+ and Vt-, the output depends on the previous state of the output. If the output was previously high, it will remain high until the input signal falls below Vt-, and if the output was previously low, it will remain low until the input signal rises above Vt+.

This behavior is known as hysteresis, and it's a form of "memory" because the circuit "remembers" its previous state. The Schmitt trigger can be thought of as having a kind of "binary memory" that depends on the input signal history.

To illustrate this, consider a Schmitt trigger with Vt+ = 2V and Vt- = 1V. Suppose the input signal starts at 0V and gradually increases. The output will be low initially. As the input signal crosses 2V, the output will switch to high. Now, even if the input signal drops back down to 1.5V, the output will remain high because the Schmitt trigger "remembers" that it was previously high. The output will only switch back to low when the input signal falls below 1V.

**So, while a Schmitt trigger doesn't have a traditional memory like a flip-flop or a register, its hysteresis behavior does provide a form of "memory" that depends on the input signal history.**
