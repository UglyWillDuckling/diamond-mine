Derain was born in 1880 in [Chatou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatou "Chatou"), [Yvelines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvelines "Yvelines"), [Île-de-France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele-de-France_\(region\) "Île-de-France (region)"), just outside Paris. In 1895 he began to study on his own, contrary to claims that meeting [Vlaminck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaminck "Vlaminck") or [Matisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matisse "Matisse") began his efforts to paint, and occasionally went to the countryside with an old friend of [Cézanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9zanne "Cézanne")'s, Father Jacomin along with his two sons.[^2] In 1898, while studying to be an engineer at the Académie Camillo,[^3] he attended painting classes under [Eugène Carrière](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Carri%C3%A8re "Eugène Carrière"), and there met Matisse. In 1900, he met and shared a studio with [Maurice de Vlaminck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_de_Vlaminck "Maurice de Vlaminck") and together they began to paint scenes in the neighbourhood, but this was interrupted by military service at [Commercy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercy "Commercy") from September 1901 to 1904.[^4] Following his release from service, Matisse persuaded Derain's parents to allow him to abandon his engineering career and devote himself solely to painting; subsequently Derain attended the [Académie Julian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Julian "Académie Julian").[^5]

*Le séchage des voiles* (*The Drying Sails*), 1905, oil on canvas, 82 × 101 cm, [Pushkin Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushkin_Museum "Pushkin Museum"), Moscow. Exhibited at the 1905 [Salon d'Automne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_d%27Automne "Salon d'Automne")

Derain and Matisse worked together through the summer of 1905 in the [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") village of [Collioure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collioure "Collioure") and Derain completed the *[Mountains at Collioure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_at_Collioure "Mountains at Collioure")* painting.[^rolfes-6] Later that year they displayed their highly innovative paintings at the [Salon d'Automne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_d%27Automne "Salon d'Automne"). The vivid, unnatural colors led the critic [Louis Vauxcelles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vauxcelles "Louis Vauxcelles") to derisively dub their works as *[les Fauves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Fauves "Les Fauves")*, or "the wild beasts", marking the start of the [Fauvist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism "Fauvism") movement.[^7] In March 1906, the noted art dealer [Ambroise Vollard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroise_Vollard "Ambroise Vollard") sent Derain to London to produce a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain presented a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as [Whistler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler "James Abbott McNeill Whistler") or [Monet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet "Claude Monet"). With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the [Thames](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames "Thames") and [Tower Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge "Tower Bridge"). These London paintings remain among his most popular work. Art critic T. G Rosenthal: "Not since Monet has anyone made London seem so fresh and yet remain quintessentially English. Some of his views of the Thames use the [Pointillist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism "Pointillism") technique of multiple dots, although by this time, because the dots have become much larger, it is rather more simply the separation of colours called [Divisionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisionism "Divisionism") and it is peculiarly effective in conveying the fragmentation of colour in moving water in sunlight."[^8]

In 1907 art dealer [Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel-Henry_Kahnweiler "Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler") purchased Derain's entire studio, granting Derain financial stability. He experimented with stone sculpture and moved to [Montmartre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre "Montmartre") to be near his friend [Pablo Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso") and other noted artists. Fernande Olivier, Picasso's mistress at the time, described Derain[^cle396-9] as:

> Slim, elegant, with a lively colour and enamelled black hair. With an English chic, somewhat striking. Fancy waistcoats, ties in crude colours, red and green. Always a pipe in his mouth, phlegmatic, mocking, cold, an arguer.

At Montmartre, Derain began to shift from the brilliant Fauvist palette to more muted tones, showing the influence of [Cubism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism "Cubism") and [Paul Cézanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne "Paul Cézanne").[^gh-10] (According to [Gertrude Stein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Stein "Gertrude Stein"), Derain may have been influenced by African sculpture before Picasso.)[^11] Derain supplied woodcuts in [primitivist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitivism "Primitivism") style for an edition of [Guillaume Apollinaire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Apollinaire "Guillaume Apollinaire")'s first book of prose, *[L'enchanteur pourrissant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27enchanteur_pourrissant "L'enchanteur pourrissant")* (1909). He displayed works at the [Neue Künstlervereinigung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_K%C3%BCnstlervereinigung "Neue Künstlervereinigung") in [Munich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich") in 1910,[^12] in 1912 at the secessionist [Der Blaue Reiter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Blaue_Reiter "Der Blaue Reiter")[^13] and in 1913 at the seminal [Armory Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armory_Show "Armory Show") in New York. He also illustrated a collection of poems by [Max Jacob](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Jacob "Max Jacob") in 1912.

### Towards a new classicism

At about this time Derain's work began overtly reflecting his study of the [Old Masters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Masters "Old Masters"). The role of color was reduced and forms became austere; the years 1911–1914 are sometimes referred to as his [gothic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_art "Gothic art") period. In 1914 he was mobilized for military service in [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and until his release in 1919 he would have little time for painting, although in 1916 he provided a set of illustrations for [André Breton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Breton "André Breton")'s first book, *Mont de Piete*.

After the war, Derain won new acclaim as a leader of the renewed [classicism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism "Classicism") then ascendant. With the wildness of his Fauve years far behind, he was admired as an upholder of tradition.[^14] In 1919 he designed the [ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet "Ballet") *[La Boutique fantasque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boutique_fantasque "La Boutique fantasque")* for [Diaghilev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Diaghilev "Serge Diaghilev"), leader of the [Ballets Russes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballets_Russes "Ballets Russes").[^australiadancing-15] A major success, it would lead to his creating many ballet designs.

The 1920s marked the height of his success, as he was awarded the [Carnegie Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Prize "Carnegie Prize") in 1928 for his *Still-life with Dead Game* and began to exhibit extensively abroad—in London, Berlin, [Frankfurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt "Frankfurt"), [Düsseldorf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf "Düsseldorf"), New York City and [Cincinnati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati "Cincinnati"), [Ohio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio "Ohio").[^cle396-9]

During the German occupation of France in [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Derain lived primarily in Paris and was much courted by the Germans because he represented the prestige of French culture. Derain accepted an invitation to make an official visit to Germany in 1941, and traveled with other French artists to Berlin to attend a [Nazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") exhibition of an [officially endorsed artist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_the_Third_Reich "Art of the Third Reich"), [Arno Breker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Breker "Arno Breker").[^gh-10] Derain's presence in Germany was used effectively by [Nazi propaganda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_propaganda "Nazi propaganda"), and after the [Liberation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe "End of World War II in Europe") he was branded a [collaborator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_with_Nazi_Germany_and_Fascist_Italy "Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy") and ostracized by many former supporters.[^dorl2008-16]

A year before his death, he contracted an eye infection from which he never fully recovered. He died in [Garches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garches "Garches"), [Hauts-de-Seine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauts-de-Seine "Hauts-de-Seine"), [Île-de-France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele-de-France_\(region\) "Île-de-France (region)"), France in 1954 when he was struck by a moving vehicle.[^17]

Derain's London paintings were the subject of a major exhibition at the [Courtauld Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtauld_Institute "Courtauld Institute") from 27 October 2005 to 22 January 2006.[^18]
