## Lint & Format HTML Templates

Once upon a time all the other programming languages had a formatter and linter. Css, javascript, python, the c suite, typescript, ruby, php, go, swift, and you know the others. *The cool kids on the block.*  
HTML templates were left out there on their own, in the cold, unformatted and unlinted:( The dirty corner in your repository. *Something had to change.*  
Welcome djLint, the free cleaning service for html templates!  
And the html templates lived happily ever after.
