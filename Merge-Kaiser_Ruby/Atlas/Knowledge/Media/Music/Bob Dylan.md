**Bob Dylan** (legally **Robert Dylan**;[^3] born **Robert Allen Zimmerman**, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Considered one of the greatest songwriters of all time,[^4][^5][^encbr-6] Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60-year career. With an estimated figure of more than 125 million records sold worldwide, he is one of the [best-selling musicians of all-time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists "List of best-selling music artists").[^7] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it "with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry".[^encbr-6] His lyrics incorporated political, social and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning [counterculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s").[^8]

Dylan was born and raised in [St. Louis County, Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Minnesota "St. Louis County, Minnesota"), and at 19 years old he moved to New York City to pursue music. Following his [1962 self-titled debut album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_\(album\) "Bob Dylan (album)") of traditional [folk songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk-songs "Folk-songs"), he released his breakthrough album *[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freewheelin%27_Bob_Dylan "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan")* (1963) which featured "[Girl from the North Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_from_the_North_Country "Girl from the North Country")" and "[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain%27s_a-Gonna_Fall "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall")", adapting the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. His songs "[Blowin' in the Wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin%27_in_the_Wind "Blowin' in the Wind")" (1963) and "[The Times They Are a-Changin'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_\(song\) "The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)")" (1964) became anthems for the [civil rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") and [antiwar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War") movements. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [drew controversy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy "Electric Dylan controversy") among folk purists when he adopted [electrically amplified](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier "Amplifier") rock instrumentation, recording the rock albums *[Bringing It All Back Home](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_It_All_Back_Home "Bringing It All Back Home")*, *[Highway 61 Revisited](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited "Highway 61 Revisited")* (both 1965) and *[Blonde on Blonde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_on_Blonde "Blonde on Blonde")* (1966). His six-minute single "[Like a Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone "Like a Rolling Stone")" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.[^lars-9][^10]

In July 1966, a motorcycle crash led Dylan to cease touring for seven years. During this period, he recorded [a large body of songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Basement_Tapes_songs "List of Basement Tapes songs") with members of [the Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band "The Band") which produced the album *[The Basement Tapes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basement_Tapes "The Basement Tapes")* (1975). Dylan explored [country music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music") and rural themes on the albums *[John Wesley Harding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Harding "John Wesley Harding")* (1967), *[Nashville Skyline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Skyline "Nashville Skyline")* (1969) and *[New Morning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Morning "New Morning")* (1970). He gained critical attention for *[Blood on the Tracks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Tracks "Blood on the Tracks")* (1975), and [*Time Out of Mind*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_of_Mind_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)") (1997), the latter of which earned him the [Grammy Award for Album of the Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year "Grammy Award for Album of the Year"). Dylan still releases music and has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the [Never Ending Tour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Ending_Tour "Never Ending Tour").[^11] Since 1994, Dylan has published [nine books of paintings and drawings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_bibliography#Art_books_by_Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan bibliography"), and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. His life has been profiled in several documentaries and the biopic *[A Complete Unknown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Complete_Unknown "A Complete Unknown")* (2024).

Dylan has received [numerous accolades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_received_by_Bob_Dylan "List of awards received by Bob Dylan") throughout his career, including an [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award "Academy Award"), ten [Grammy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award "Grammy Award") and a [Golden Globe Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award"). He was honored with the [Kennedy Center Honors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors "Kennedy Center Honors") in 1997, [National Medal of Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Arts "National Medal of Arts") in 2009, and the [Presidential Medal of Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom "Presidential Medal of Freedom") in 2012. Dylan has been inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"), the [Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame "Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame") and the [Songwriters Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame "Songwriters Hall of Fame"). He has also been awarded a [Pulitzer Prize special citation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_Special_Citations_and_Awards "Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards") in 2008, and the 2016 [Nobel Prize in Literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "Nobel Prize in Literature") "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition".[^nobelcite-12]

## Early life and education

![[~/×/b7bb5c97ba5862191dde335795db1a04_MD5.jpg]]

The Zimmerman family home in Hibbing, Minnesota

Bob Dylan was born **Robert Allen Zimmerman** (his [Hebrew name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_name "Hebrew name") is *Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham*)[^sounes14-1][^13][^14] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in [Duluth, Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota "Duluth, Minnesota").[^15] Dylan's paternal grandparents, Anna Kirghiz and Zigman Zimmerman, emigrated from [Odessa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa "Odessa") in the [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") (now [Odesa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odesa "Odesa"), Ukraine) to the United States, following the [1905 pogroms against Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_pogroms#1905_Pogrom "Odessa pogroms").[^sounes-p12-16] His maternal grandparents, Florence and Ben Stone, were [Lithuanian Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews "Lithuanian Jews") who had arrived in the United States in 1902.[^sounes-p12-16] Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother's family was originally from the [Kağızman District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%C4%9F%C4%B1zman_District "Kağızman District") of [Kars Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kars_Province "Kars Province") in northeastern Turkey.[^17]

Dylan's father Abram Zimmerman and his mother Beatrice "Beatty" Stone were part of a small, close-knit Jewish community.[^18][^19][^haaretz-20] They lived in Duluth until Dylan was six, when his father contracted [polio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio "Polio") and the family returned to his mother's hometown of [Hibbing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibbing,_Minnesota "Hibbing, Minnesota"), where they lived for the rest of Dylan's childhood, and his father and paternal uncles ran a furniture and appliance store.[^haaretz-20][^hibb-21]

In the early 1950s Dylan listened to the [Grand Ole Opry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry "Grand Ole Opry") radio show and heard the songs of [Hank Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams "Hank Williams"). He later wrote: "The sound of his voice went through me like an electric rod."[^chronicles95-22] Dylan was also impressed by the delivery of [Johnnie Ray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Ray "Johnnie Ray"): "He was the first singer whose voice and style, I guess, I totally fell in love with… I loved his style, wanted to dress like him too."[^23] As a teenager, Dylan heard [rock and roll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll "Rock and roll") on radio stations broadcasting from [Shreveport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana "Shreveport, Louisiana") and [Little Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas "Little Rock, Arkansas").[^shelton-38-24]

Dylan formed several bands while attending [Hibbing High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibbing_High_School "Hibbing High School"). In the Golden Chords, he performed [covers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version "Cover version") of songs by [Little Richard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Richard "Little Richard")[^grayjapan-25] and [Elvis Presley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley "Elvis Presley").[^26] Their performance of [Danny & the Juniors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_%26_the_Juniors "Danny & the Juniors")' "[Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Is_Here_to_Stay "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay")" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone.[^27] In 1959, Dylan's high school yearbook carried the caption "Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'".[^grayjapan-25][^28] That year, as Elston Gunnn, he performed two dates with [Bobby Vee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Vee "Bobby Vee"), playing piano and clapping.[^29][^30][^31] In September 1959, Dylan enrolled at the [University of Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota "University of Minnesota").[^32] Living at the Jewish-centric fraternity [Sigma Alpha Mu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Alpha_Mu "Sigma Alpha Mu") house, Dylan began to perform at the Ten O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became involved in the [Dinkytown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkytown "Dinkytown") [folk music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music") circuit.[^33][^no_direction_home-34] His focus on rock and roll gave way to [American folk music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music "American folk music"), as he explained in a 1985 interview:

> The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.[^crowe-1985-35]

During this period, he began to introduce himself as "Bob Dylan".[^36] In his memoir, he wrote that he considered adopting the surname *Dillon* before unexpectedly seeing poems by [Dylan Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas "Dylan Thomas"), and deciding upon the given name spelling.[^37][^38] In a 2004 interview, he said, "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."[^60minutes2005-39]

## Career

### 1960–1962: Relocation to New York and stardom

[[[[Woody Guthrie]]]]
In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol [Woody Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie "Woody Guthrie")[^40] at [Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greystone_Park_Psychiatric_Hospital "Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital") in New Jersey.[^41] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. He wrote of Guthrie's impact: 

> "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them... \[He\] was the true voice of the Americarn spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple".[^42] 

%% stopped here %%
In addition to visiting Guthrie, Dylan befriended his protégé [Ramblin' Jack Elliott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramblin%27_Jack_Elliott "Ramblin' Jack Elliott").[^43]

From February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around [Greenwich Village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village "Greenwich Village"), befriending and picking up material from folk singers, including [Dave Van Ronk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Van_Ronk "Dave Van Ronk"), [Fred Neil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil "Fred Neil"), [Odetta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odetta "Odetta"), the [New Lost City Ramblers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Lost_City_Ramblers "New Lost City Ramblers") and Irish musicians [the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clancy_Brothers "The Clancy Brothers").[^44] In September, *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* critic [Robert Shelton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shelton_\(critic\) "Robert Shelton (critic)") boosted Dylan's career with a very enthusiastic review of his performance at [Gerde's Folk City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerde%27s_Folk_City "Gerde's Folk City"): "Bob Dylan: A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist".[^45] 
That month, Dylan played harmonica on folk singer [Carolyn Hester](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Hester "Carolyn Hester")'s third album, bringing him to the attention of the album's producer [John Hammond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hammond_\(record_producer\) "John Hammond (record producer)"),[^46] who signed Dylan to [Columbia Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records "Columbia Records").[^47] Dylan's debut album, *[Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_\(album\) "Bob Dylan (album)")*, released March 19, 1962,[^48][^49] consisted of traditional folk, blues and [gospel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music "Gospel music") material with just two original compositions, "[Talkin' New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin%27_New_York "Talkin' New York")" and "[Song to Woody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_to_Woody "Song to Woody")". The album sold 5,000 copies in its first year, just breaking even.[^scaduto110-50]

![[~/×/a7bbe5fd44ab97d8d30c8d8ef71f8722_MD5.jpg]]

[Joan Baez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez "Joan Baez") and Dylan during the civil rights "[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom")", August 28, 1963

****In August 1962***, Dylan changed his name to Bob Dylan,[^51] and signed a management contract with [Albert Grossman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman "Albert Grossman").[^52] Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was known for his sometimes confrontational personality and protective loyalty.[^53] Dylan said, "He was kind of like a [Colonel Tom Parker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Tom_Parker "Colonel Tom Parker") figure ... you could smell him coming."[^no_direction_home-34] Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to the latter suggesting Dylan work with the jazz producer [Tom Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wilson_\(producer\) "Tom Wilson (producer)"), who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson produced the next three albums Dylan recorded.[^54][^55]

Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963.[^heylin-p35-56] He had been invited by television director [Philip Saville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Saville "Philip Saville") to appear in *[Madhouse on Castle Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_on_Castle_Street "Madhouse on Castle Street")*, which Saville was directing for [BBC Television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Television "BBC Television").[^flash-back-57] At the end of the play, Dylan performed "[Blowin' in the Wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin%27_in_the_Wind "Blowin' in the Wind")", one of its first public performances.[^flash-back-57] While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including [the Troubadour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubadour,_London "The Troubadour, London"), [Les Cousins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Cousins_\(music_club\) "Les Cousins (music club)"), and [Bunjies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunjies "Bunjies").[^heylin-p35-56][^58] He also learned material from UK performers, including [Martin Carthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Carthy "Martin Carthy").[^flash-back-57]

By the release of Dylan's second album, *[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freewheelin%27_Bob_Dylan "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan")*, in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter. Many songs on the album were labeled [protest songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_song "Protest song"), inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger")'s passion for topical songs.[^59] "[Oxford Town](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Town "Oxford Town")" was an account of [James Meredith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Meredith "James Meredith")'s ordeal as the first Black student to enroll at the [University of Mississippi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi "University of Mississippi").[^60] The first song on the album, "Blowin' in the Wind", partly derived its melody from the traditional [slave song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Songs_of_the_United_States "Slave Songs of the United States") "No More Auction Block",[^61] while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for [Peter, Paul and Mary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter,_Paul_and_Mary "Peter, Paul and Mary").[^ppm-62] "[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain%27s_a-Gonna_Fall "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall")" was based on the folk ballad "[Lord Randall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Randall "Lord Randall")". With its apocalyptic premonitions, the song gained resonance when the [Cuban Missile Crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis "Cuban Missile Crisis") developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.[^63][^64] Both songs marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a [stream-of-consciousness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_\(narrative_mode\) "Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)"), [imagist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagism "Imagism") lyrical attack with traditional folk form.[^65]

Dylan's topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter. [Janet Maslin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin "Janet Maslin") wrote of *Freewheelin'*:

> These were the songs that established \[Dylan\] as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [nuclear disarmament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament "Nuclear disarmament") and the growing [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement "Civil Rights Movement"): his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.[^66][^67]

*Freewheelin'* also included love songs and surreal [talking blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_blues "Talking blues"). Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,[^68] and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including [the Beatles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles "The Beatles"). [George Harrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison "George Harrison") said of the album: "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderful".[^69]

The rough edge of Dylan's singing unsettled some but attracted others. Author [Joyce Carol Oates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Carol_Oates "Joyce Carol Oates") wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying".[^70] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as [Joan Baez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez "Joan Baez"), who became Dylan's advocate and lover.[^71] Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.[^72] Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included [the Byrds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds "The Byrds"), [Sonny & Cher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_%26_Cher "Sonny & Cher"), [the Hollies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollies "The Hollies"), [the Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association "The Association"), [Manfred Mann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mann "Manfred Mann") and [the Turtles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtles "The Turtles").

"[Mixed-Up Confusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-Up_Confusion "Mixed-Up Confusion")", recorded during the *Freewheelin'* sessions with a backing band, was released as Dylan's first single in December 1962, but then swiftly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [rockabilly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockabilly "Rockabilly") sound. [Cameron Crowe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Crowe "Cameron Crowe") described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and [Sun Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Records "Sun Records")".[^73]

Dylan said of "The Times They Are a-Changin'": "This was definitely a song with a purpose. I wanted to write a big song, some kind of theme song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close and allied together at that time."[^crowe-1985-35]

In May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of *[The Ed Sullivan Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show "The Ed Sullivan Show")*. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that "[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin%27_John_Birch_Paranoid_Blues "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues")" was potentially [libelous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libelous "Libelous") to the [John Birch Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society "John Birch Society"). Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.[^74]

Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the [March on Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom") on August 28, 1963. Dylan performed "[Only a Pawn in Their Game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_a_Pawn_in_Their_Game "Only a Pawn in Their Game")" and "[When the Ship Comes In](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Ship_Comes_In "When the Ship Comes In")".[^75]

Dylan's third album, *[The Times They Are a-Changin'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)")*, reflected a more politicized Dylan.[^76] The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with "[Only a Pawn in Their Game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_a_Pawn_in_Their_Game "Only a Pawn in Their Game")" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [Medgar Evers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers "Medgar Evers"), and the [Brechtian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht "Bertolt Brecht") "[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonesome_Death_of_Hattie_Carroll "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll")" the death of Black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll at the hands of young White socialite William Zantzinger.[^77] "[Ballad of Hollis Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_of_Hollis_Brown "Ballad of Hollis Brown")" and "[North Country Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Country_Blues "North Country Blues")" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities.[^78]

The final track on the album expressed Dylan's angry response to a hostile profile published in *[Newsweek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek "Newsweek")*.[^svedb-79] As biographer [Clinton Heylin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Heylin "Clinton Heylin") puts it, the profile wrote about "the way the Bar Mitzvah boy from Hibbing, Minnesota, had reinvented himself as the prince of protest", emphasising his birth name Robert Zimmerman, his attendance at the University of Minnesota and his close relationship with his parents whom he claimed to be estranged from.[^svedb-79][^80] The day after the article appeared, Dylan returned to the studio to record "[Restless Farewell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_Farewell "Restless Farewell")" which ends with his vow to "make my stand/ And remain as I am/ And bid farewell and not give a damn".[^81]

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.[^82] Accepting the "[Tom Paine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine "Thomas Paine") Award" from the [Emergency Civil Liberties Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergency_Civil_Liberties_Committee "National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee") three weeks after the [assassination of John F. Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "Assassination of John F. Kennedy"), an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, [Lee Harvey Oswald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald "Lee Harvey Oswald").[^83]

 *Bobby* Dylan, as the college yearbook lists him: [St. Lawrence University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_University "St. Lawrence University"), upstate New York, November 1963

[Johnny Cash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash "Johnny Cash") supported Dylan in his refusal to conform when he wrote a letter to *[Broadside](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadside_\(magazine\) "Broadside (magazine)")* magazine in March 1964, expressing admiration for Dylan's writing and ending with the injunction: “Shut up! And let him sing!”[^84] When Cash died in 2003, Dylan remembered: "Johnny wrote the magazine saying to shut up and let me sing, that I knew what I was doing. This was before I had ever met him, and the letter meant the world to me."[^85][^cashinfluence-86] Cash and Dylan met for the first time at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1964 and became friends.[^87]

*[Another Side of Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Side_of_Bob_Dylan "Another Side of Bob Dylan")*, recorded in a single evening on June 9, 1964,[^88] had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on "[I Shall Be Free No. 10](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Shall_Be_Free_No._10 "I Shall Be Free No. 10")" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "[Spanish Harlem Incident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Harlem_Incident "Spanish Harlem Incident")" and "[To Ramona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Ramona "To Ramona")" are passionate love songs, while "[Black Crow Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Crow_Blues "Black Crow Blues")" and "[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Believe_You_\(She_Acts_Like_We_Never_Have_Met\) "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)")" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "[It Ain't Me Babe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Ain%27t_Me_Babe "It Ain't Me Babe")", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.[^89] His new direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic "[Chimes of Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimes_of_Freedom_\(song\) "Chimes of Freedom (song)")", which sets [social commentary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_commentary "Social commentary") against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by [Allen Ginsberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg "Allen Ginsberg") as "chains of flashing images,"[^90] and "[My Back Pages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Back_Pages "My Back Pages")", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions.[^91]

In late 1964 and early 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to [folk-rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk-rock "Folk-rock") pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [Carnaby Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaby_Street "Carnaby Street") wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed "[Beatle boots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatle_boot "Beatle boot")". A London reporter noted "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of [Leicester Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_Square "Leicester Square"). He looks like an undernourished [cockatoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo "Cockatoo")."[^92] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Asked about a movie he planned while on [Les Crane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Crane "Les Crane")'s television show, he told Crane it would be a "cowboy horror movie". Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, "No, I play my mother."[^93]

### 1965–1969: Going electric and motorcycle accident

 .jpg)

The [cinéma vérité](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9 "Cinéma vérité") documentary *[Dont Look Back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont_Look_Back "Dont Look Back")* (1967) follows Dylan on his [1965 tour of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_England_Tour_1965 "Bob Dylan England Tour 1965"). An early music video for "[Subterranean Homesick Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subterranean_Homesick_Blues "Subterranean Homesick Blues")" was used as the film's opening segment.

Dylan's late March 1965 album, *[Bringing It All Back Home](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_It_All_Back_Home "Bringing It All Back Home")*, was another leap,[^94] featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance.[^95] The first single, "[Subterranean Homesick Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subterranean_Homesick_Blues "Subterranean Homesick Blues")", owed much to [Chuck Berry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry "Chuck Berry")'s "[Too Much Monkey Business](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Much_Monkey_Business "Too Much Monkey Business")";[^96] its free-association lyrics described as harking back to the energy of [beat poetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_poetry "Beat poetry") and as a forerunner of [rap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping "Rapping") and [hip-hop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music "Hip hop music").[^97] The song was provided with an early music video, which opened [D. A. Pennebaker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._A._Pennebaker "D. A. Pennebaker")'s [cinéma vérité](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9 "Cinéma vérité") presentation of Dylan's 1965 British tour, *[Dont Look Back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont_Look_Back "Dont Look Back")*.[^98] Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.[^99]

The second side of *Bringing It All Back Home* contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.[^sounes-168-100] "[Mr. Tambourine Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Tambourine_Man "Mr. Tambourine Man")" became one of his best-known songs when [The Byrds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds "The Byrds") recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK.[^101][^102] "[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_All_Over_Now,_Baby_Blue "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue")" and "[It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Alright_Ma_\(I%27m_Only_Bleeding\) "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)")" were two of Dylan's most important compositions.[^sounes-168-100][^103]

In 1965, headlining the [Newport Folk Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival "Newport Folk Festival"), Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a [pickup group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_group "Pickup group") featuring [Mike Bloomfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bloomfield "Mike Bloomfield") on guitar and [Al Kooper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Kooper "Al Kooper") on organ.[^104] Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 was met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. [Murray Lerner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Lerner "Murray Lerner"), who filmed the performance, said: "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."[^105] An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set.[^106][^107]

Dylan's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.[^108][^109] In the September issue of *[Sing Out!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_Out! "Sing Out!")*, [Ewan MacColl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewan_MacColl "Ewan MacColl") wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel".[^110] On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording "[Positively 4th Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positively_4th_Street "Positively 4th Street")". The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia,[^111] and have been interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community he had known in clubs along [West 4th Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Street_\(Manhattan\) "4th Street (Manhattan)").[^112]

***Highway 61 Revisited* and *Blonde on Blonde***

<audio id="mwe_player_1_placeholder" preload="none" data-mw-tmh="" class="" width="232" data-durationhint="30" data-mwtitle="Bob_Dylan_-_Like_a_Rolling_Stone.ogg" data-mwprovider="local" playsinline="" disabled="disabled" tabindex="-1"></audio>Duration: 30 seconds.

Dylan's 1965 hit single, which appeared on the album *[Highway 61 Revisited](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited "Highway 61 Revisited")*. In 2004, it was chosen as the greatest song of all time by *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* magazine.[^rs500-113]

In July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single "[Like a Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone "Like a Rolling Stone")" peaked at number two in the US chart. In 2004 and in 2011, *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* listed it as number one on "[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time")".[^lars-9][^rs500-113] [Bruce Springsteen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen "Bruce Springsteen") recalled first hearing the song: "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind."[^:sprinsgteen-114] The song opened Dylan's next album, *[Highway 61 Revisited](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited "Highway 61 Revisited")*, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of [New Orleans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans").[^115] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. "[Desolation Row](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desolation_Row "Desolation Row")", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass,[^116] offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a [Fellini-esque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini "Federico Fellini") parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters".[^117] Poet [Philip Larkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin "Philip Larkin"), who also reviewed jazz for *[The Daily Telegraph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")*, wrote "I'm afraid I poached Bob Dylan's *Highway 61 Revisited* (CBS) out of curiosity and found myself well rewarded."[^118]

Dylan in 1966

In support of the album, Dylan was booked for two US concerts with Al Kooper and [Harvey Brooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Brooks_\(bassist\) "Harvey Brooks (bassist)") from his studio crew and [Robbie Robertson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson "Robbie Robertson") and [Levon Helm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levon_Helm "Levon Helm"), former members of [Ronnie Hawkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Hawkins "Ronnie Hawkins")'s backing band [the Hawks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hawks_\(band\) "The Hawks (band)").[^119] On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the [Hollywood Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Bowl "Hollywood Bowl") was more favorable.[^120]

From September 24, 1965, in Austin, Texas, Dylan toured the US and Canada for six months, backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as [The Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band "The Band").[^121] While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences, their studio efforts foundered. Producer [Bob Johnston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Johnston "Bob Johnston") persuaded Dylan to record in [Nashville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee "Nashville, Tennessee") in February 1966, and surrounded him with top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.[^122] The Nashville sessions produced the double album *[Blonde on Blonde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_on_Blonde "Blonde on Blonde")* (1966), featuring what Dylan called "that thin wild mercury sound".[^123] Kooper described it as "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical worlds of Nashville and of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.[^124]

On November 22, 1965, Dylan quietly married 25-year-old former model [Sara Lownds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Dylan "Sara Dylan").[^sounes-p193-125] Some of Dylan's friends, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.[^sounes-p193-125] Writer [Nora Ephron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_Ephron "Nora Ephron") made the news public in the *[New York Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post "New York Post")* in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed".[^126]

Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [acoustic guitar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel-string_guitar "Steel-string guitar") and harmonica. In the second, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and [slow clapped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_clap "Slow clap").[^127] The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [Free Trade Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Trade_Hall "Free Trade Hall") in England on May 17, 1966.[^128] A recording of this concert was released in 1998: *[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._4:_Bob_Dylan_Live_1966,_The_%22Royal_Albert_Hall%22_Concert "The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert")*. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: "[Judas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot "Judas Iscariot")!" to which Dylan responded, "I don't believe you ... You're a liar!" Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"[^129]

During his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting "as if on a death trip".[^130] D. A. Pennebaker, the filmmaker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else".[^131] In a 1969 interview with [Jann Wenner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jann_Wenner "Jann Wenner"), Dylan said, "I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things ... just to keep going, you know?"[^132]

On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle, a [Triumph Tiger 100](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Tiger_100 "Triumph Tiger 100"), near his home in [Woodstock, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York "Woodstock, New York"). Dylan said he broke several [vertebrae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrae "Vertebrae") in his neck.[^sounes-217-133] The circumstances of the accident are unclear since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.[^sounes-217-133][^crash-134] Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him.[^sounes-217-133][^shades268-135] Dylan concurred: "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race."[^136] He made very few public appearances, and did not tour again for almost eight years.[^crash-134][^137]

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, but they rejected it as incomprehensible to mainstream audiences.[^138] The film, titled *[Eat the Document](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_the_Document "Eat the Document")* on [bootleg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleg_recording "Bootleg recording") copies, has since been screened at a few film festivals.[^139] Secluded from public gaze, Dylan recorded [over 100 songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Basement_Tapes_songs "List of Basement Tapes songs") during 1967 at his Woodstock home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, "[Big Pink](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Pink "Big Pink")".[^140] These songs were initially offered as demos for other artists to record and were hits for [Julie Driscoll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Driscoll "Julie Driscoll"), the Byrds, and Manfred Mann. The public heard these recordings when *[Great White Wonder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Wonder "Great White Wonder")*, the first "[bootleg recording](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleg_recording "Bootleg recording")", appeared in West Coast shops in July 1969, containing Dylan material recorded in Minneapolis in 1961 and seven Basement Tapes songs. This record gave birth to a minor industry in the illicit release of recordings by Dylan and other major rock artists.[^141] Columbia released a Basement selection in 1975 as *[The Basement Tapes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basement_Tapes "The Basement Tapes")*.

In late 1967, Dylan returned to studio recording in Nashville,[^bjornerjwh-142] accompanied by [Charlie McCoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McCoy "Charlie McCoy") on bass,[^bjornerjwh-142] [Kenny Buttrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Buttrey "Kenny Buttrey") on drums[^bjornerjwh-142] and [Pete Drake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Drake "Pete Drake") on steel guitar.[^bjornerjwh-142] The result was *[John Wesley Harding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Harding "John Wesley Harding")*, a record of short songs thematically drawing on the [American West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_West "American West") and [the Bible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible"). The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the [Judeo-Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judeo-Christian "Judeo-Christian") tradition seriously, was a departure from Dylan's previous work.[^143] It included "[All Along the Watchtower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower "All Along the Watchtower")", famously covered by [Jimi Hendrix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix "Jimi Hendrix").[^crowe-1985-35][^144] [Woody Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie "Woody Guthrie") died in October 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a memorial concert held at [Carnegie Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Hall "Carnegie Hall") on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by the Band.[^145]

*[Nashville Skyline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Skyline "Nashville Skyline")* (1969), featured Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with [Johnny Cash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash "Johnny Cash") and the single "[Lay Lady Lay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lay_Lady_Lay "Lay Lady Lay")".[^147] *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* wrote, "Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range."[^148] During one recording session, Dylan and Cash recorded a series of duets, but only their version of "[Girl from the North Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_from_the_North_Country "Girl from the North Country")" appeared on the album.[^cashdylan-149][^mornings-150] The album influenced the nascent genre of [country rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_rock "Country rock").[^encbr-6]

In 1969, Dylan was asked to write songs for *Scratch*, [Archibald MacLeish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_MacLeish "Archibald MacLeish")'s musical adaptation of "[The Devil and Daniel Webster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_and_Daniel_Webster "The Devil and Daniel Webster")". MacLeish initially praised Dylan's contributions, writing to him "Those songs of yours have been haunting me—and exciting me," but creative differences led to Dylan leaving the project. Some of the songs were later recorded by Dylan in a revised form.[^macl-151] In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of *[The Johnny Cash Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Johnny_Cash_Show "The Johnny Cash Show")* where he sang a duet with Cash on "Girl from the North Country" and played solos of "Living the Blues" and "[I Threw It All Away](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Threw_It_All_Away "I Threw It All Away")". Dylan traveled to England to top the bill at the [Isle of Wight Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight_Festival_1969 "Isle of Wight Festival 1969") on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the [Woodstock Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_Festival "Woodstock Festival") closer to home.[^152]

### 1970–1979: Return to touring and Christian music

In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. [Greil Marcus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greil_Marcus "Greil Marcus") asked "What is this shit?" upon first hearing *[Self Portrait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_Portrait_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)")*, released in June 1970.[^153][^154] It was a double LP including few original songs and was poorly received.[^155] In October 1970, Dylan released *[New Morning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Morning "New Morning")*, considered a return to form.[^156] The title track was from Dylan's ill-fated collaboration with MacLeish,[^macl-151] and "Day of the Locusts" was his account of receiving an honorary degree from [Princeton University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") on June 9, 1970.[^157] In November 1968, Dylan co-wrote "[I'd Have You Anytime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27d_Have_You_Anytime "I'd Have You Anytime")" with George Harrison;[^158] Harrison recorded that song and Dylan's "[If Not for You](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Not_for_You "If Not for You")" for his album *[All Things Must Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Must_Pass "All Things Must Pass")*. [Olivia Newton-John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Newton-John "Olivia Newton-John") covered "If Not For You" on her [debut album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Not_for_You_\(album\) "If Not for You (album)") and "[The Man in Me](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_Me "The Man in Me")" was prominently featured in the film *[The Big Lebowski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski "The Big Lebowski")* (1998).

*[Tarantula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_\(poetry_collection\) "Tarantula (poetry collection)")*, a freeform book of prose-poetry, had been written by Dylan during a creative burst in 1964–65.[^159] Dylan shelved his book for several years, apparently uncertain of its status,[^160] until he suddenly informed [Macmillan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macmillan_Inc. "Macmillan Inc.") at the end of 1970 that the time had come to publish it.[^161] The book attracted negative reviews but later critics have suggested its affinities with *[Finnegans Wake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake "Finnegans Wake")* and *[A Season in Hell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Season_in_Hell "A Season in Hell")*.[^162]

Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan recorded with [Leon Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Russell "Leon Russell") at [Blue Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Rock_Studio "Blue Rock Studio"), a small studio in Greenwich Village. These sessions resulted in "[Watching the River Flow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watching_the_River_Flow "Watching the River Flow")" and a new recording of "[When I Paint My Masterpiece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I_Paint_My_Masterpiece "When I Paint My Masterpiece")".[^163] On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded "[George Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Jackson_\(song\) "George Jackson (song)")", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of [Black Panther](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party "Black Panther Party") [George Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Jackson_\(Black_Panther\) "George Jackson (Black Panther)") in [San Quentin State Prison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Quentin_State_Prison "San Quentin State Prison").[^164] Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's [Concert for Bangladesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_for_Bangladesh "Concert for Bangladesh") on August 1, 1971, attracted media coverage as his live appearances had become rare.[^165]

In 1972, Dylan joined [Sam Peckinpah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Peckinpah "Sam Peckinpah")'s film *[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_the_Kid "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid")*, providing [the soundtrack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Garrett_and_Billy_the_Kid_\(album\) "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)") and playing "Alias", a member of Billy's gang.[^166] Despite the film's failure at the box office, "[Knockin' on Heaven's Door](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockin%27_on_Heaven%27s_Door "Knockin' on Heaven's Door")" became one of Dylan's most covered songs.[^167][^168] That same year, Dylan protested the move to deport [John Lennon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon "John Lennon") and [Yoko Ono](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Ono "Yoko Ono"), who had been convicted for [marijuana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana "Marijuana") possession, by sending a letter to the US [Immigration Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service "Immigration and Naturalization Service") which read in part: "Hurray for John & Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!"[^169]

 Bob Dylan and [the Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band "The Band") commenced their 1974 tour in Chicago on January 3.[^170]

Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, [David Geffen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geffen "David Geffen")'s [Asylum Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_Records "Asylum Records"), when his contract with Columbia Records expired.[^171] His next album, *[Planet Waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Waves "Planet Waves")*, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour.[^172] The album included two versions of ["Forever Young"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_\(Bob_Dylan_song\) "Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)"), which became one of his most popular songs.[^sounes-p273-173] As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan",[^174] and Dylan said "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental".[^crowe-1985-35] Columbia Records simultaneously released *[Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_\(1973_album\) "Dylan (1973 album)")*, a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.[^175]

In January 1974, Dylan, backed by the Band, embarked on a [North American tour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_and_The_Band_1974_Tour "Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour") of 40 concerts—his first tour for seven years. A live double album, *[Before the Flood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Flood_\(album\) "Before the Flood (album)")*, was released on Asylum Records. Soon, according to [Clive Davis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Davis "Clive Davis"), Columbia Records sent word they "will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold".[^shelton-378-176] Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, unhappy that Geffen had sold only 600,000 copies of *Planet Waves* despite millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour;[^177] he returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.[^178]

Dylan said of the opening song from *[Blood on the Tracks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Tracks "Blood on the Tracks")*: "I was trying to deal with the concept of time, and the way the characters change from the first person to the third person, and you're never sure if the first person is talking or the third person. But as you look at the whole thing it really doesn't matter."[^crowe-1985-35]

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled three small notebooks with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded the album *[Blood on the Tracks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Tracks "Blood on the Tracks")* in September 1974.[^179][^180] Dylan delayed the album's release and re-recorded half the songs at [Sound 80](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_80 "Sound 80") Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.[^181] Released in early 1975, *Blood on the Tracks* received mixed reviews. In *[NME](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME "NME")*, [Nick Kent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kent "Nick Kent") described the "accompaniments" as "often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes".[^heylin_383-182] In *Rolling Stone*, [Jon Landau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Landau "Jon Landau") wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness".[^heylin_383-182] Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's masterpieces. In *[Salon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_\(website\) "Salon (website)")*, journalist Bill Wyman wrote:

> *Blood on the Tracks* is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.[^183]

 Bob Dylan with [Allen Ginsberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg "Allen Ginsberg") on the [Rolling Thunder Revue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder_Revue "Rolling Thunder Revue") in 1975

In the middle of 1975, Dylan championed boxer [Rubin "Hurricane" Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_Carter "Rubin Carter"), imprisoned for triple murder, with his ballad "[Hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_\(Bob_Dylan_song\) "Hurricane (Bob Dylan song)")" making the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its length—over eight minutes—the song was released as a single, peaking at 33 on the US [Billboard chart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 "Billboard Hot 100"), and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the [Rolling Thunder Revue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder_Revue "Rolling Thunder Revue").[^184][^185] Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour featured about one hundred performers and supporters from the Greenwich Village folk scene, among them Ramblin' Jack Elliott, [T-Bone Burnett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Bone_Burnett "T-Bone Burnett"), [Joni Mitchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell "Joni Mitchell"),[^kokay-186][^sloman-187] [David Mansfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mansfield "David Mansfield"), [Roger McGuinn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McGuinn "Roger McGuinn"), [Mick Ronson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Ronson "Mick Ronson"), [Ronee Blakely](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronee_Blakely "Ronee Blakely"), Joan Baez and [Scarlet Rivera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Rivera "Scarlet Rivera"), whom Dylan discovered walking down the street, her violin case on her back.[^188] The tour encompassed the January 1976 release of the album *[Desire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Desire (Bob Dylan album)")*. Many of *Desire'*s songs featuring a [travelogue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_literature "Travel literature")\-like narrative style, influenced by Dylan's new collaborator, playwright [Jacques Levy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Levy "Jacques Levy").[^189][^190] The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, *Hard Rain*, and the LP *[Hard Rain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rain_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)")*.

 Dylan performing in the [De Kuip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip "De Kuip") Stadium, Rotterdam, June 23, 1978

The 1975 tour with the Revue provided the backdrop to Dylan's film *[Renaldo and Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaldo_and_Clara "Renaldo and Clara")*, a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Actor and playwright [Sam Shepard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Shepard "Sam Shepard") accompanied the Revue and was to serve as screenwriter, but much of the film was improvised. Released in 1978, it received negative, sometimes scathing, reviews.[^191][^192] Later in the year, a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, was more widely released.[^193] In November 1976, Dylan appeared at the Band's farewell concert with [Eric Clapton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton "Eric Clapton"), [Muddy Waters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddy_Waters "Muddy Waters"), [Van Morrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Morrison "Van Morrison"), [Neil Young](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young "Neil Young") and Joni Mitchell. [Martin Scorsese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese "Martin Scorsese")'s 1978 film of the concert, *[The Last Waltz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Waltz "The Last Waltz")*, included most of Dylan's set.[^194]

 A promotional poster released by CBS to promote Bob Dylan's 1978 Japan tour. The Japanese caption on the poster translates as, "If you see Bob Dylan, say hello."

In 1978, Dylan embarked on a [year-long world tour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_Tour "1978 Tour"), performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and North America, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album *[Bob Dylan at Budokan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_at_Budokan "Bob Dylan at Budokan")*.[^sounes314-195] Reviews were mixed. [Robert Christgau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau "Robert Christgau") awarded the album a C+ rating,[^196] while Janet Maslin defended it: "These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals".[^197] When Dylan brought the tour to the US in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a "Las Vegas Tour".[^198] The 1978 tour grossed more than $20 million, and Dylan told the *Los Angeles Times* that he had debts because "I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house  ... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California."[^sounes314-195] In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same band and vocalists into Rundown Studios in [Santa Monica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica "Santa Monica"), California, to record an album of new material, *[Street-Legal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street-Legal_\(album\) "Street-Legal (album)")*.[^199] It was described by [Michael Gray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gray_\(author\) "Michael Gray (author)") as "after *Blood On The Tracks*, arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life".[^200] However, it had poor sound and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.[^201][^202]

Dylan took five months off at the beginning of 1979 to attend Bible school.[^crowe-1985-35] His subsequent album *[Slow Train Coming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Train_Coming "Slow Train Coming")* reached No. 3 on the US [*Billboard* 200](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200 "Billboard 200") chart and included this [Grammy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award "Grammy Award")\-winning song.

In the late 1970s, Dylan converted to [Evangelical Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Christianity "Evangelical Christianity"),[^203][^vineyard-204] undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the [Association of Vineyard Churches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Vineyard_Churches "Association of Vineyard Churches").[^205][^206] He released three albums of contemporary [gospel music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music "Gospel music"). *[Slow Train Coming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Train_Coming "Slow Train Coming")* (1979) featured [Dire Straits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Straits "Dire Straits") guitarist [Mark Knopfler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Knopfler "Mark Knopfler") and was produced by veteran R&B producer [Jerry Wexler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Wexler "Jerry Wexler"). Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: "Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album."[^207] Dylan won the [Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Male_Rock_Vocal_Performance "Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance") for the song "[Gotta Serve Somebody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotta_Serve_Somebody "Gotta Serve Somebody")". When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:

> Years ago they ... said I was a prophet. I used to say, "No I'm not a prophet", they say "Yes you are, you're a prophet." I said, "No it's not me." They used to say "You sure are a prophet." They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say, "Bob Dylan's no prophet." They just can't handle it.[^208]

Dylan's Christianity was unpopular with some fans and musicians.[^209] John Lennon, shortly before [being murdered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_John_Lennon "Murder of John Lennon"), recorded "Serve Yourself" in response to "Gotta Serve Somebody".[^210] In 1981, [Stephen Holden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Holden "Stephen Holden") wrote in *The New York Times* that "neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament".[^211]

### 1980–1989: Career fluctuations

In late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. His second Christian album, *[Saved](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Saved (Bob Dylan album)")* (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as "the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, *Slow Train Coming II* and inferior".[^212] His third Christian album was *[Shot of Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_of_Love "Shot of Love")* (1981).[^thompson2000-213] The album featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs. The lyrics of ["Every Grain of Sand"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Grain_of_Sand_\(Bob_Dylan_song\) "Every Grain of Sand (Bob Dylan song)") recall [William Blake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake "William Blake")'s "[Auguries of Innocence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguries_of_Innocence "Auguries of Innocence")".[^214] [Elvis Costello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Costello "Elvis Costello") wrote that "*Shot of Love* may not be your favorite Bob Dylan record, but it might contain his best song: 'Every Grain of Sand'."[^215]

 Dylan in Toronto, April 18, 1980

Reception of Dylan's 1980s recordings varied. Gray criticized Dylan's 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.[^216] *[Infidels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidels_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Infidels (Bob Dylan album)")* (1983) employed Knopfler again as lead guitarist and also as producer; the sessions resulted in several songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were "[Blind Willie McTell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Willie_McTell_\(song\) "Blind Willie McTell (song)")", which was both a tribute to the [eponymous blues musician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Willie_McTell "Blind Willie McTell") and an evocation of [African American history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_history "African American history"),[^217] "Foot of Pride" and "[Lord Protect My Child](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Protect_My_Child "Lord Protect My Child")". These three songs were later released on *[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Volumes_1%E2%80%933_\(Rare_%26_Unreleased\)_1961%E2%80%931991 "The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991")*.[^218]

Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded *[Empire Burlesque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Burlesque "Empire Burlesque")*.[^sounes362-219] [Arthur Baker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Baker_\(musician\) "Arthur Baker (musician)"), who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and [Cyndi Lauper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper "Cyndi Lauper"), was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound "a little bit more contemporary".[^sounes362-219] In 1985 Dylan sang on [USA for Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_for_Africa "USA for Africa")'s famine relief single "[We Are the World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World "We Are the World")". He also joined [Artists United Against Apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artists_United_Against_Apartheid "Artists United Against Apartheid"), providing vocals for their single "[Sun City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_City_\(song\) "Sun City (song)")".[^220] On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the [Live Aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid") concert at [JFK Stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK_Stadium "JFK Stadium"), Philadelphia. Backed by [Keith Richards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Richards "Keith Richards") and [Ronnie Wood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood "Ronnie Wood"), he performed a ragged version of "Ballad of Hollis Brown", a tale of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience: "I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks".[^221] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but inspired [Willie Nelson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson "Willie Nelson") to organize a concert, [Farm Aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Aid "Farm Aid"), to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.[^222]

In October 1985, Dylan released [*Biograph*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biograph_\(album\) "Biograph (album)"), a box set featuring 53 tracks, 18 of them previously unreleased. [Stephen Thomas Erlewine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine "Stephen Thomas Erlewine") wrote: "Historically, *Biograph* is significant not for what it did for Dylan's career, but for establishing the box set, complete with hits and rarities, as a viable part of rock history."[^223] *Biograph* also contained liner notes by [Cameron Crowe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Crowe "Cameron Crowe") in which Dylan discussed the origins of some of his songs.[^224]

In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into [rap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rap "Rap") when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock" on [Kurtis Blow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtis_Blow "Kurtis Blow")'s album *[Kingdom Blow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Blow "Kingdom Blow")*.[^225] Dylan's next studio album, *[Knocked Out Loaded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocked_Out_Loaded "Knocked Out Loaded")* (1986), contained three covers (by [Junior Parker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Parker "Junior Parker"), [Kris Kristofferson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kristofferson "Kris Kristofferson") and the gospel hymn "[Precious Memories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Memories_\(hymn\) "Precious Memories (hymn)")"), plus three collaborations (with [Tom Petty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty "Tom Petty"), Sam Shepard and [Carole Bayer Sager](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Bayer_Sager "Carole Bayer Sager")), and two solo compositions by Dylan. A reviewer wrote that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating."[^226] It was the first Dylan album since his 1962 debut to fail to make the Top 50.[^227] Some critics have called the song Dylan co-wrote with Shepard, "[Brownsville Girl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville_Girl "Brownsville Girl")", a masterpiece.[^228]

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with [Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty_and_the_Heartbreakers "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers"), sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the [Grateful Dead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead "Grateful Dead") in 1987, resulting in the live album *[Dylan & The Dead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_%26_The_Dead "Dylan & The Dead")*, which received negative reviews; Erlewine said it was "quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead".[^229] Dylan initiated what came to be called the [Never Ending Tour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Ending_Tour "Never Ending Tour") on June 7, 1988, performing with a back-up band featuring guitarist [G. E. Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Smith "G. E. Smith"). Dylan would continue to tour with a small, changing band for the next 30 years.[^230] In 1987, Dylan starred in [Richard Marquand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Marquand "Richard Marquand")'s movie *[Hearts of Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Fire "Hearts of Fire")*, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover ([Fiona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_\(singer\) "Fiona (singer)")) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation ([Rupert Everett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Everett "Rupert Everett")).[^231] Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—"Night After Night", and "Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of [John Hiatt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hiatt "John Hiatt")'s "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.[^232]

 Dylan in Barcelona, Spain, 1984

Dylan was inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame") in January 1988. Bruce Springsteen, in his introduction, declared, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual".[^:sprinsgteen-114] *[Down in the Groove](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_in_the_Groove "Down in the Groove")* (1988) sold even more poorly than *Knocked Out Loaded*.[^sounes_385-233] Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."[^gray_2000,_p._13-234] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [Traveling Wilburys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_Wilburys "Traveling Wilburys"), a [supergroup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_\(music\) "Supergroup (music)") Dylan co-founded with George Harrison, [Jeff Lynne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Lynne "Jeff Lynne"), [Roy Orbison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Orbison "Roy Orbison") and Tom Petty. In late 1988, their *[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._1 "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1")* reached number three on the US albums chart,[^sounes_385-233] featuring songs described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.[^235] Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, *[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._3 "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3")*.[^236]

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with *[Oh Mercy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Mercy "Oh Mercy")*, produced by [Daniel Lanois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Lanois "Daniel Lanois"). Gray praised the album as "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."[^gray_2000,_p._13-234] "[Most of the Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_of_the_Time "Most of the Time")", a lost-love composition, was prominently featured in the film [*High Fidelity*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_\(film\) "High Fidelity (film)") (2000), while "[What Was It You Wanted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Was_It_You_Wanted "What Was It You Wanted")" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.[^237] The religious imagery of ["Ring Them Bells"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Them_Bells_\(song\) "Ring Them Bells (song)") struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.[^238]

### 1990–1999: Return to Folk music and resurgence

Dylan's 1990s began with *[Under the Red Sky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Red_Sky "Under the Red Sky")* (1990), an about-face from the serious *Oh Mercy*. It contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [Carolyn Dennis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Dennis "Carolyn Dennis"), Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.[^239] Musicians on the album included George Harrison, [Slash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_\(musician\) "Slash (musician)"), [David Crosby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Crosby "David Crosby"), [Bruce Hornsby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby "Bruce Hornsby"), [Stevie Ray Vaughan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan "Stevie Ray Vaughan"), and [Elton John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John "Elton John"). The record received negative reviews and sold poorly.[^240] In 1990 and 1991 Dylan was described by his biographers as drinking heavily, impairing his performances on stage.[^241][^242] In an interview with *Rolling Stone*, Dylan dismissed allegations that drinking was interfering with his music: "That's completely inaccurate. I can drink or not drink. I don't know why people would associate drinking with *anything* I do, really".[^243]

Defilement and remorse were themes Dylan addressed when he received a [Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award "Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award") from [Jack Nicholson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson "Jack Nicholson") in February 1991.[^lifetime-244] The event coincided with the start of the [Gulf War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War "Gulf War") and Dylan played "[Masters of War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_War "Masters of War")"; *Rolling Stone* called his performance "almost unintelligible".[^:r&rencylopedia-245] He made a short speech: "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways'".[^lifetime-244][^heylin-664-246] This was a paraphrase of 19th-century Orthodox Rabbi [Samson Raphael Hirsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch "Samson Raphael Hirsch")'s commentary on Psalm 27.[^247] On October 16, 1992, the thirtieth anniversary of Dylan's debut album was celebrated with a concert at [Madison Square Garden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden "Madison Square Garden"), christened "Bobfest" by Neil Young and featuring [John Mellencamp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp "John Mellencamp"), [Stevie Wonder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder "Stevie Wonder"), [Lou Reed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed "Lou Reed"), [Eddie Vedder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Vedder "Eddie Vedder"), Dylan and others. It was recorded as the live album *[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_30th_Anniversary_Concert_Celebration "The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration")*.[^:r&rencylopedia-245]

Over the next few years Dylan returned to his roots with two albums covering traditional folk and blues songs: *[Good as I Been to You](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_as_I_Been_to_You "Good as I Been to You")* (1992) and *[World Gone Wrong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Gone_Wrong "World Gone Wrong")* (1993), backed solely by his acoustic guitar.[^248] Many critics and fans noted the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",[^249] written by a 19th-century teacher. In August 1994, he played at [Woodstock '94](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_%2794 "Woodstock '94"); *Rolling Stone* called his performance "triumphant".[^:r&rencylopedia-245] In November, Dylan recorded two live shows for *[MTV Unplugged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged "MTV Unplugged")*. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by [Sony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony "Sony") executives who insisted on hits.[^250] The resulting album, *[MTV Unplugged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)")*, included ["John Brown"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_\(song\) "John Brown (song)"), an unreleased 1962 song about how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.[^251]

 Dylan performs during the 1996 Lida Festival in [Stockholm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm "Stockholm").

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch,[^252] Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's [Criteria Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_Studios "Criteria Studios") in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.[^253] Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with life-threatening [pericarditis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericarditis "Pericarditis"), brought on by [histoplasmosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoplasmosis "Histoplasmosis"). His scheduled European tour was canceled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon".[^254] He was back on the road by mid-year, and performed before [Pope John Paul II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II "Pope John Paul II") at the World Eucharistic Conference in [Bologna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna "Bologna"), Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 to a [homily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homily "Homily") based on Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind".[^255]

In September, Dylan released the new Lanois-produced album, [*Time Out of Mind*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_of_Mind_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)"). With its bitter assessments of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. [Alex Ross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ross_\(music_critic\) "Alex Ross (music critic)") called it "a thrilling return to form".[^:ross-256] "[Cold Irons Bound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Irons_Bound "Cold Irons Bound")" won Dylan another Grammy For Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and the album won him his first [Grammy Award for Album of the Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year "Grammy Award for Album of the Year").[^257] The album's first single, "[Not Dark Yet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Dark_Yet "Not Dark Yet")", has been called one of Dylan's best songs[^258] and "[Make You Feel My Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_You_Feel_My_Love "Make You Feel My Love")" was covered by [Billy Joel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Joel "Billy Joel"), [Garth Brooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Brooks "Garth Brooks"), [Adele](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele "Adele") and others. Elvis Costello said "I think it might be the best record he's made."[^259]

### 2000–2009: Oscar win, memoir, and *Modern Times*

In 2001, Dylan won an [Academy Award for Best Original Song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song "Academy Award for Best Original Song") for "[Things Have Changed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Have_Changed "Things Have Changed")", written for the film *[Wonder Boys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boys_\(film\) "Wonder Boys (film)")*.[^261] *["Love and Theft"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Love_and_Theft%22 "\"Love and Theft\"")* was released on September 11, 2001. Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album under the alias Jack Frost.[^262] Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include [rockabilly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockabilly "Rockabilly"), [Western swing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_swing "Western swing"), [jazz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz") and [lounge music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lounge_music "Lounge music").[^263] The album won the [Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Contemporary_Folk_Album "Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album").[^264] Controversy ensued when *[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")* pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and [Junichi Saga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junichi_Saga "Junichi Saga")'s book *[Confessions of a Yakuza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_a_Yakuza "Confessions of a Yakuza")*. Saga was not familiar with Dylan's work, but said he was flattered. Upon hearing the album, Saga said of Dylan: "His lines flow from one image to the next and don't always make sense. But they have a great atmosphere."[^265][^266]

In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his Christian period and participated in the project *[Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotta_Serve_Somebody:_The_Gospel_Songs_of_Bob_Dylan "Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan")*. That year, Dylan released *[Masked & Anonymous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_%26_Anonymous "Masked & Anonymous")*, which he co-wrote with director [Larry Charles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Charles "Larry Charles") under the alias Sergei Petrov.[^267] Dylan starred as Jack Fate, alongside a cast that included [Jeff Bridges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges "Jeff Bridges"), [Penélope Cruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz "Penélope Cruz") and [John Goodman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Goodman "John Goodman"). The film polarized critics.[^268] In *The New York Times*, [A. O. Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._O._Scott "A. O. Scott") called it as an "incoherent mess";[^269] a few treated it as a serious work of art.[^270][^masked-271]

In 2004, Dylan published the first part of his memoir, *[Chronicles: Volume One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles:_Volume_One "Chronicles: Volume One")*. Confounding expectations,[^maslin-272] Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961–1962, virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height, while devoting chapters to the albums *New Morning* (1970) and *Oh Mercy* (1989). The book reached number two on *The New York Times'* Hardcover Non-Fiction bestseller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a [National Book Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Book_Award "National Book Award").[^273]

Critics noted that *Chronicles* contained many examples of pastiche and borrowing; sources included [*Time* magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")[^274] and the novels of [Jack London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London "Jack London").[^275] Biographer [Clinton Heylin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Heylin "Clinton Heylin") queried the veracity of Dylan's autobiography, noting "Not a single checkable story held water; not one anecdote couldn't be shot full of holes by any half-decent researcher."[^276]

Martin Scorsese's Dylan documentary *[No Direction Home](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Direction_Home "No Direction Home")* was broadcast on September 26–27, 2005, on [BBC Two](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two "BBC Two") in the UK and as part of *[American Masters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Masters "American Masters")* on [PBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS") in the US.[^277] It covers the period from Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with [Suze Rotolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo "Suze Rotolo"), [Liam Clancy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Clancy "Liam Clancy"), Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, [Mavis Staples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Staples "Mavis Staples") and Dylan himself. The film earned a [Peabody Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award "Peabody Award")[^278] and a [Columbia-duPont Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_I._duPont%E2%80%93Columbia_University_Award "Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award").[^279] The [accompanying soundtrack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._7:_No_Direction_Home:_The_Soundtrack "The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack") featured unreleased songs from Dylan's early years.[^nyt-280]

Dylan's career as a radio presenter began on May 3, 2006, with his weekly program, *[Theme Time Radio Hour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Time_Radio_Hour "Theme Time Radio Hour")*, on [XM Satellite Radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_Satellite_Radio "XM Satellite Radio"). He played songs with a common theme, such as "Weather", "Weddings", "Dance" and "Dreams".[^281][^282] Dylan's records ranged from [Muddy Waters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddy_Waters "Muddy Waters") to [Prince](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_\(musician\) "Prince (musician)"), [L.L. Cool J](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.L._Cool_J "L.L. Cool J") to [the Streets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets "The Streets"). Dylan's show was praised for the breadth of his musical selections[^283] and for his jokes, stories and eclectic references.[^284][^285] In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was "Goodbye" and he signed off with Woody Guthrie's "[So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_It%27s_Been_Good_to_Know_Yuh "So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh")".[^286]

 Dylan, the Spectrum, 2007

Dylan released [*Modern Times*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Times_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)") in August 2006. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* characterized his singing on the album as "a catarrhal death rattle"[^287]) most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, encompassing *Time Out of Mind* and *"Love and Theft"*.[^288] *Modern Times* entered the US charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's *Desire*.[^289] *The New York Times* published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in *Modern Times* and the work of the [Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") poet [Henry Timrod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Timrod "Henry Timrod").[^nyttimrod-290] *Modern Times* won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Dylan won [Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rock_Vocal_Performance,_Solo "Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo") for "Someday Baby".[^291] *Modern Times* was named Album of the Year by *Rolling Stone*[^292] and *[Uncut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_\(magazine\) "Uncut (magazine)")*.[^293] On the same day that *Modern Times* was released, the [iTunes Music Store](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Music_Store "ITunes Music Store") released *[Bob Dylan: The Collection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan:_The_Collection "Bob Dylan: The Collection")*, a digital box set containing all of his albums (773 tracks), along with 42 rare and unreleased tracks.[^294]

 Bob Dylan performs at Air Canada Centre, Toronto, November 7, 2006.

On October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective *[Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_\(2007_album\) "Dylan (2007 album)")*, anthologizing his entire career under the *Dylan 07* logo.[^295] The sophistication of the *Dylan 07* marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylan's commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s. This became evident in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for [Victoria's Secret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria%27s_Secret "Victoria's Secret").[^296] In October 2007, he participated in a multi-media campaign for the 2008 [Cadillac Escalade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Escalade "Cadillac Escalade").[^297][^298] In 2009 he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career to date, appearing with rapper [will.i.am](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will.i.am "Will.i.am") in a [Pepsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi "Pepsi") ad that debuted during [Super Bowl XLIII](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIII "Super Bowl XLIII"). The ad opened with Dylan singing the first verse of "Forever Young" followed by will.i.am doing a [hip hop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music "Hip hop music") version of the song's third and final verse.[^299]

*[The Bootleg Series Vol. 8 – Tell Tale Signs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._8_%E2%80%93_Tell_Tale_Signs:_Rare_and_Unreleased_1989%E2%80%932006 "The Bootleg Series Vol. 8 – Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006")* was released in October 2008, as both a two-CD set and a three-CD version with a 150-page hardcover book. The set contains live performances and outtakes from selected studio albums from *Oh Mercy* to *Modern Times*, as well as soundtrack contributions and collaborations with [David Bromberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bromberg "David Bromberg") and [Ralph Stanley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Stanley "Ralph Stanley").[^300] The pricing of the album—the two-CD set went on sale for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99—led to complaints about "rip-off packaging".[^301][^302] The release was widely acclaimed by critics.[^303] The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes "feels like a new Bob Dylan record, not only for the astonishing freshness of the material, but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here".[^304]

Dylan released *[Together Through Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_Through_Life "Together Through Life")* on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, Dylan explained it originated when French director [Olivier Dahan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Dahan "Olivier Dahan") asked him to supply a song for his movie *[My Own Love Song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Own_Love_Song "My Own Love Song")*. He initially intended to record a single track, "Life Is Hard", but "the record sort of took its own direction".[^305] Nine of the album's ten songs are credited as co-written by Dylan and [Robert Hunter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_\(lyricist\) "Robert Hunter (lyricist)").[^306] The album received largely favorable reviews,[^307] although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon.[^308] In its first week of release, the album reached number one on the [*Billboard* 200](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200 "Billboard 200") chart in the US, making Dylan, at 67 years of age, the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart.[^caulfield,_keith-309]

Dylan's *[Christmas in the Heart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_the_Heart "Christmas in the Heart")* was released in October 2009, comprising such [Christmas standards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_music "Christmas music") as "[Little Drummer Boy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Drummer_Boy "Little Drummer Boy")", "[Winter Wonderland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Wonderland "Winter Wonderland")" and "[Here Comes Santa Claus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Santa_Claus "Here Comes Santa Claus")".[^310] [Edna Gundersen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Gundersen "Edna Gundersen") wrote that Dylan was "revisiting yuletide styles popularized by [Nat King Cole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole "Nat King Cole"), [Mel Tormé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Torm%C3%A9 "Mel Tormé"), and the [Ray Conniff Singers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Conniff_Singers "Ray Conniff Singers")".[^311] Dylan's royalties from the album were donated to the charities [Feeding America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_America "Feeding America") in the US, [Crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_\(charity\) "Crisis (charity)") in the UK, and the [World Food Programme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme "World Food Programme").[^uk_fundraising-312] The album received generally favorable reviews.[^313] In an interview published in *[The Big Issue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Issue "The Big Issue")*, Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and he replied: "There wasn't any other way to play it. These songs are part of my life, just like folk songs. You have to play them straight too."[^dylan_2009_interview_with_bill_flanagan-314]

### 2010–2019: *Tempest* and continued recordings

Volume 9 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, [*The Witmark Demos*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._9_%E2%80%93_The_Witmark_Demos:_1962%E2%80%931964 "The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 – The Witmark Demos: 1962–1964"), was issued in October 18, 2010. It comprised 47 [demo recordings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_\(music\) "Demo (music)") of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan's earliest music publishers: Leeds Music in 1962, and [Witmark Music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Witmark_%26_Sons "M. Witmark & Sons") from 1962 to 1964. One reviewer described the set as "a hearty glimpse of young Bob Dylan changing the music business, and the world, one note at a time."[^315] On the critical aggregator [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), the album has a score of 86, indicating "universal acclaim".[^316] In the same week, [Sony Legacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_Recordings "Legacy Recordings") released *[Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Original_Mono_Recordings "The Original Mono Recordings")*, a box set that presented Dylan's eight earliest albums, from *Bob Dylan* (1962) to *John Wesley Harding* (1967), in their original mono mix in the CD format for the first time. The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by Greil Marcus.[^317][^318]

On April 12, 2011, Legacy Recordings released *[Bob Dylan in Concert – Brandeis University 1963](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Concert_%E2%80%93_Brandeis_University_1963 "In Concert – Brandeis University 1963")*, taped at [Brandeis University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandeis_University "Brandeis University") on May 10, 1963, two weeks before the release of *The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan*. The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer [Ralph J. Gleason](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_J._Gleason "Ralph J. Gleason"), and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray, who says it captures Dylan "from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn't yet reached America. It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period ... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star."[^319]

 Dylan and the Obamas at the [White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House"), after a performance celebrating music from the [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") (February 9, 2010)

On Dylan's 70th birthday, three universities organized symposia on his work: the [University of Mainz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mainz "University of Mainz"),[^320] the [University of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna "University of Vienna"),[^321] and the [University of Bristol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bristol "University of Bristol")[^322] invited literary critics and cultural historians to give papers on aspects of Dylan's work. Other events, including tribute bands, discussions and simple singalongs, took place around the world, as reported in *The Guardian*: "From Moscow to Madrid, Norway to Northampton and Malaysia to his home state of Minnesota, self-confessed 'Bobcats' will gather today to celebrate the 70th birthday of a giant of popular music."[^323]

Dylan's 35th studio album, [*Tempest*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Tempest (Bob Dylan album)"), was released on September 11, 2012.[^324] The album features a tribute to John Lennon, "[Roll On John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_On_John "Roll On John")", and [the title track](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_\(Bob_Dylan_song\) "Tempest (Bob Dylan song)") is a 14-minute song about the [sinking of the *Titanic*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic "Sinking of the RMS Titanic").[^325] In *Rolling Stone*, Will Hermes gave *Tempest* five out of five stars, writing: "Lyrically, Dylan is at the top of his game, joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire".[^tempestrollingstone-326]

Volume 10 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, *[Another Self Portrait (1969–1971)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._10:_Another_Self_Portrait_\(1969%E2%80%931971\) "The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969–1971)")*, was released in August 2013.[^327] The album contained 35 previously unreleased tracks, including alternative takes and demos from Dylan's 1969–1971 recording sessions during the making of the *Self Portrait* and *New Morning* albums. The box set also included a live recording of Dylan's performance with the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969. Thom Jurek wrote, "For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it's an indispensable addition to the catalog."[^328] Columbia Records released a boxed set containing all 35 Dylan studio albums, six albums of live recordings and a collection of non-album material (*Sidetracks*) as [*Bob Dylan: Complete Album Collection: Vol. One*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Album_Collection_Vol._1_\(album\) "The Complete Album Collection Vol. 1 (album)"), in November 2013.[^329][^330] To publicize the box set, an innovative video of "Like a Rolling Stone" was released on Dylan's website. The interactive video, created by director [Vania Heymann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vania_Heymann "Vania Heymann"), allowed viewers to switch between 16 simulated TV channels, all featuring characters who are lip-synching the lyrics.[^331][^332]

Dylan appeared in a commercial for the [Chrysler 200](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_200 "Chrysler 200") car which aired during the [2014 Super Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII "Super Bowl XLVIII"). In it, he says that "Detroit made cars and cars made America... So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone. *We* will build your car." Dylan's ad was criticized for its [protectionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism "Protectionism") implications, and people wondered whether he had "[sold out](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selling_out "Selling out")".[^333][^334] *The Lyrics: Since 1962* was published by [Simon & Schuster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Schuster "Simon & Schuster") in the fall of 2014. The book was edited by literary critic [Christopher Ricks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Ricks "Christopher Ricks"), Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow and offered variant versions of Dylan's songs, sourced from out-takes and live performances. A limited edition of 50 books, signed by Dylan, was priced at $5,000. "It's the biggest, most expensive book we've ever published, as far as I know", said Jonathan Karp, Simon & Schuster's president and publisher.[^335][^336] A comprehensive edition of the Basement Tapes, songs recorded by Dylan and the Band in 1967, was released as *[The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._11:_The_Basement_Tapes_Complete "The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete")* in November 2014. The album included 138 tracks in a six-CD box; the 1975 album *The Basement Tapes* contained just 24 tracks from the material which Dylan and the Band had recorded at their homes in Woodstock, New York in 1967. Subsequently, [over 100 recordings and alternate takes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Basement_Tapes_songs "List of Basement Tapes songs") had circulated on bootleg records. The sleeve notes are by author [Sid Griffin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Griffin "Sid Griffin").[^337][^338] *The Basement Tapes Complete* won the [Grammy Award for Best Historical Album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Historical_Album "Grammy Award for Best Historical Album").[^339] The box set earned a score of 99 on Metacritic.[^340]

In February 2015, Dylan released *[Shadows in the Night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_the_Night "Shadows in the Night")*, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963,[^secret-341][^shadowsbauder-342] which have been described as part of the [Great American Songbook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Songbook "Great American Songbook").[^shadowspetridis-343] All of the songs had been recorded by [Frank Sinatra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra "Frank Sinatra"), but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of "Sinatra covers".[^secret-341][^shadowsgq-344] Dylan explained: "I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day".[^345] Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and the quality of Dylan's singing.[^shadowspetridis-343][^shadowstelegraph-346] The album debuted at number one in the [UK Albums Chart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart "UK Albums Chart") in its first week of release.[^347] *[The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._12:_The_Cutting_Edge_1965%E2%80%931966 "The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966")*, consisting of previously unreleased material from the three albums Dylan recorded between January 1965 and March 1966 (*Bringing It All Back Home*, *Highway 61 Revisited* and *Blonde on Blonde*) was released in November 2015. The set was released in three formats: a 2-CD "Best Of" version, a 6-CD "Deluxe edition", and an 18-CD limited "Collector's Edition". On Dylan's website the "Collector's Edition" was described as containing "every single note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in 1965/1966".[^348][^349] *The Best of the Cutting Edge* entered the *[Billboard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_\(magazine\) "Billboard (magazine)")* Top Rock Albums chart at number one on November 18, based on its first-week sales.[^350]

Dylan released *[Fallen Angels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_Angels_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Fallen Angels (Bob Dylan album)")*, described as "a direct continuation of the work of 'uncovering' the Great Songbook that he began on *Shadows In the Night*", in May.[^ward-351] The album contained twelve songs by classic songwriters such as [Harold Arlen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Arlen "Harold Arlen"), [Sammy Cahn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Cahn "Sammy Cahn") and [Johnny Mercer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mercer "Johnny Mercer"), eleven of which had been recorded by Sinatra.[^ward-351] Jim Farber wrote in *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")*: "Tellingly, \[Dylan\] delivers these songs of love lost and cherished not with a burning passion but with the wistfulness of experience. They're memory songs now, intoned with a present sense of commitment. Released just four days ahead of his 75th birthday, they couldn't be more age-appropriate".[^352] *[The 1966 Live Recordings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1966_Live_Recordings_\(Album\) "The 1966 Live Recordings (Album)")*, including every known recording of Dylan's 1966 concert tour, was released in November 2016.[^353] The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the [Royal Albert Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall "Royal Albert Hall") concert in London on May 27.[^354][^355] *The New York Times* reported most of the concerts had "never been heard in any form", and described the set as "a monumental addition to the corpus".[^356]

In March 2017, Dylan released a triple album of 30 more recordings of classic American songs, *[Triplicate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplicate_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Triplicate (Bob Dylan album)")*. Dylan's 38th studio album was recorded in [Hollywood's Capitol Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Studios "Capitol Studios") and features his touring band.[^357] Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia.

> Nostalgic? No I wouldn't say that. It's not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the good old days or fond memories of what's no more. A song like ['Sentimental Journey'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_Journey_\(song\) "Sentimental Journey (song)") is not a way back when song, it doesn't emulate the past, it's attainable and down to earth, it's in the here and now.[^358]

Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the Great American Songbook, though, in the opinion of *Uncut*, "For all its easy charms, *Triplicate* labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter."[^359] The next volume of Dylan's Bootleg Series revisited his "Born Again" Christian period of 1979 to 1981, described by *Rolling Stone* as "an intense, wildly controversial time that produced three albums and some of the most confrontational concerts of his long career".[^trouble-360] Reviewing the box set *[The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._13:_Trouble_No_More_1979%E2%80%931981 "The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981")*, comprising 8 CDs and 1 DVD,[^trouble-360] [Jon Pareles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pareles "Jon Pareles") wrote in *The New York Times*:

> Decades later, what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylan's unmistakable fervor, his sense of mission. The studio albums are subdued, even tentative, compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylan's voice is clear, cutting and ever improvisational; working the crowds, he was emphatic, committed, sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music.[^361]

*Trouble No More* includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylan's gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor [Michael Shannon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shannon "Michael Shannon").

In April 2018, Dylan made a contribution to the compilation EP *[Universal Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Love_%E2%80%93_Wedding_Songs_Reimagined "Universal Love – Wedding Songs Reimagined")*, a collection of reimagined wedding songs for the [LGBT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT "LGBT") community.[^mgmresorts-362] The album was funded by [MGM Resorts International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International "MGM Resorts International") and the songs are intended to function as "wedding anthems for same-sex couples".[^varietylgbt-363] Dylan recorded the 1929 song "[She's Funny That Way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_Funny_That_Way "She's Funny That Way")", changing the gender pronoun to "He's Funny That Way". The song was previously recorded by [Billie Holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday "Billie Holiday") and Frank Sinatra.[^varietylgbt-363][^nytgay-364] That same month, *The New York Times* reported that Dylan was launching Heaven's Door, a range of three [whiskeys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky "Whisky"). The *Times* described the venture as "Mr. Dylan's entry into the booming celebrity-branded spirits market, the latest career twist for an artist who has spent five decades confounding expectations".[^nytwhiskey-365] Dylan has been involved in both the creation and the marketing of the range; on September 21, 2020, Dylan resurrected *Theme Time Radio Hour* with a two-hour special with the theme of "Whiskey".[^whisk-366] On November 2, 2018, Dylan released *[More Blood, More Tracks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._14:_More_Blood,_More_Tracks "The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks")* as Volume 14 in the Bootleg Series. The set comprises all Dylan's recordings for *Blood On the Tracks* and was issued as a single CD and also as a six-CD Deluxe Edition.[^367]

In 2019, [Netflix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") released *[Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder_Revue:_A_Bob_Dylan_Story_by_Martin_Scorsese "Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese")*, billed as "Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream".[^368][^willman2019-369] The film received largely positive reviews but also aroused controversy because it mixed documentary footage filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue in the fall of 1975 with fictitious characters and stories.[^370][^371] Coinciding with the film release, the box set *[The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_%E2%80%93_The_Rolling_Thunder_Revue:_The_1975_Live_Recordings "Bob Dylan – The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings")*, was released by Columbia Records. The set comprises five full Dylan performances from the tour and recently discovered tapes from Dylan's tour rehearsals.[^372] The box set received an aggregate score of 89 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim".[^373] The next installment of Dylan's Bootleg Series, *[Bob Dylan (featuring Johnny Cash) – Travelin' Thru, 1967 – 1969: The Bootleg Series Vol. 15](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._15:_Travelin%27_Thru,_1967%E2%80%931969 "The Bootleg Series Vol. 15: Travelin' Thru, 1967–1969")*, was released on November 1. The set comprises outtakes from Dylan's albums *John Wesley Harding* and *Nashville Skyline*, and songs that Dylan recorded with Johnny Cash in Nashville in 1969 and with [Earl Scruggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Scruggs "Earl Scruggs") in 1970.[^374][^375]

### 2020–present

***Rough and Rowdy Ways***

On March 26, 2020, Dylan released "[Murder Most Foul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Most_Foul_\(song\) "Murder Most Foul (song)")", a seventeen-minute song revolving around the [Kennedy assassination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "Assassination of John F. Kennedy"), on his YouTube channel.[^mmf-376] *[Billboard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_\(magazine\) "Billboard (magazine)")* reported on April 8 that "Murder Most Foul" had topped the Billboard Rock Digital Song Sales Chart, the first time that Dylan had scored a number one song on a pop chart under his own name.[^377] Three weeks later, on April 17, 2020, Dylan released another new song, "[I Contain Multitudes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Contain_Multitudes "I Contain Multitudes")".[^378][^379] The title is from [Walt Whitman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman "Walt Whitman")'s poem "[Song of Myself](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Myself "Song of Myself")".[^380] On May 7, Dylan released a third single, "[False Prophet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Prophet_\(song\) "False Prophet (song)")", accompanied by the news that the three songs would all appear on a forthcoming double album.

*[Rough and Rowdy Ways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_and_Rowdy_Ways "Rough and Rowdy Ways")*, Dylan's 39th studio album and his first album of original material since 2012, was released on June 19 to favorable reviews.[^metar-381] [Alexis Petridis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Petridis "Alexis Petridis") wrote: "For all its bleakness, *Rough and Rowdy Ways* might well be Bob Dylan's most consistently brilliant set of songs in years: the die-hards can spend months unravelling the knottier lyrics, but you don't need a PhD in Dylanology to appreciate its singular quality and power."[^382] [Rob Sheffield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Sheffield "Rob Sheffield") wrote: "While the world keeps trying to celebrate him as an institution, pin him down, cast him in the Nobel Prize canon, embalm his past, this drifter always keeps on making his next escape. On *Rough and Rowdy Ways*, Dylan is exploring terrain nobody else has reached before—yet he just keeps pushing on into the future".[^383] The album earned a score of 95 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim".[^metar-381] In its first week of release *Rough and Rowdy Ways* reached number one on the UK album chart, making Dylan "the oldest artist to score a No. 1 of new, original material".[^384]

In December 2020, it was announced that Dylan had sold his entire song catalog to [Universal Music Publishing Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Publishing_Group "Universal Music Publishing Group"),[^385] including both the income he receives as a songwriter and his control of their copyright. Universal, a division of the French media conglomerate [Vivendi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi "Vivendi"), will collect all future income from the songs.[^nytprice-386] *The New York Times* stated Universal had purchased the copyright to over 600 songs and the price was "estimated at more than $300 million",[^nytprice-386] although other reports suggested the figure was closer to $400 million.[^387]

In February 2021, Columbia Records released *1970*, a three-CD set of recordings from the *Self Portrait* and *New Morning* sessions, including the entirety of the session Dylan recorded with George Harrison on May 1, 1970.[^1970box-388][^georg-389] Dylan's 80th birthday was commemorated by a virtual conference, Dylan@80, organized by the [University of Tulsa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tulsa "University of Tulsa") Institute for Bob Dylan Studies. The program featured seventeen sessions over three days delivered by over fifty international scholars, journalists and musicians.[^390] Several new biographies and studies of Dylan were published.[^391][^392]

In July 2021, livestream platform Veeps presented a 50-minute performance by Dylan, *[Shadow Kingdom: The Early Songs of Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Kingdom:_The_Early_Songs_of_Bob_Dylan "Shadow Kingdom: The Early Songs of Bob Dylan")*.[^warrior-393] Filmed in black and white with a [film noir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir") look,[^lynch-394] Dylan performed 13 songs in a club setting with an audience.[^warrior-393][^joy-395] The performance was favorably reviewed,[^joy-395][^lynch-394] and one critic suggested the backing band resembled the style of the musical *[Girl from the North Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_from_the_North_Country_\(musical\) "Girl from the North Country (musical)")*.[^396] The [soundtrack to the film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Kingdom "Shadow Kingdom") was released on 2 LP and CD formats in June 2023.[^397] In September, Dylan released *[Springtime in New York: The Bootleg Series Vol. 16 (1980–1985)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._16:_Springtime_in_New_York_1980%E2%80%931985 "The Bootleg Series Vol. 16: Springtime in New York 1980–1985")*, issued in 2 LP, 2 CD and 5 CD formats. It comprised rehearsals, live recordings, out-takes and alternative takes from *Shot of Love*, *Infidels* and *Empire Burlesque*.[^398] In *[The Daily Telegraph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")*, [Neil McCormick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_McCormick "Neil McCormick") wrote: "These bootleg sessions remind us that Dylan's worst period is still more interesting than most artists' purple patches".[^399] *Springtime in New York* received an aggregate score of 85 on Metacritic.[^400]

On July 7, 2022, [Christie's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie%27s "Christie's"), London, auctioned a 2021 recording of Dylan singing "Blowin' in the Wind". The record was in an innovative "one of one" recording medium, branded as Ionic Original, which producer T Bone Burnett claimed "surpasses the sonic excellence and depth for which analogue sound is renowned, while at the same time boasting the durability of a digital recording."[^401][^402] The recording fetched GBP £1,482,000—equivalent to $1,769,508.[^1.8-403][^404] In November, Dylan published *[The Philosophy of Modern Song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Modern_Song "The Philosophy of Modern Song")*, a collection of 66 essays on songs by other artists. *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* described it as "a rich, riffy, funny, and completely engaging book of essays".[^405] Other reviewers praised the book's eclectic outlook,[^406] while some questioned its variations in style and dearth of female songwriters.[^407]

In January 2023, Dylan released *[The Bootleg Series Vol. 17: Fragments – Time Out of Mind Sessions (1996–1997)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._17:_Fragments_%E2%80%93_Time_Out_of_Mind_Sessions_\(1996%E2%80%931997\) "The Bootleg Series Vol. 17: Fragments – Time Out of Mind Sessions (1996–1997)")* in multiple formats. The 5-CD version comprised a re-mix of the 1997 album "to sound more like how the songs came across when the musicians originally played them in the room" without the effects and processing which producer Daniel Lanois applied later; 25 previously unreleased out-takes from the studio sessions; and a disc of live performances of each song on the album performed by Dylan and his band in concert.[^toom-408] On November 17, 2023, Dylan released *[The Complete Budokan 1978](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Budokan_1978 "The Complete Budokan 1978")*, containing the full recordings of the February 28 and March 1 Tokyo concerts from his 1978 Tour.[^409]

Dylan contributed a cover version of [Cole Porter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter "Cole Porter")'s song "[Don't Fence Me In](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Fence_Me_In_\(song\) "Don't Fence Me In (song)")" to the soundtrack of the biographical film *[Reagan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_\(2024_film\) "Reagan (2024 film)")*, which was released on August 30, 2024.[^410] On September 20, 2024, Dylan released *The 1974 Live Recordings*, a 27-disc CD boxset of recordings from the 1974 Bob Dylan & The Band tour, featuring 417 previously unreleased live tracks.[^411]

## Never Ending Tour

## Personal life

### Romantic relationships

#### Echo Helstrom

[Echo Helstrom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_Helstrom "Echo Helstrom") was Dylan's high school girlfriend. The couple listened together to rhythm-and-blues on the radio, and her family exposed him to singers such as [Jimmie Rodgers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Rodgers "Jimmie Rodgers") on [78 RPM records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record#78_rpm_disc_developments "Phonograph record"), and a range of folk music magazines, sheet music, and manuscripts.[^425] Helstrom is believed by some to be the inspiration for Dylan's song "[Girl from the North Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_from_the_North_Country "Girl from the North Country")", though this is disputed.[^426]

#### Suze Rotolo

Dylan's first serious relationship was with artist [Suze Rotolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo "Suze Rotolo"), a daughter of [Communist Party USA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA") radicals. According to Dylan, "She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen ... The air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin".[^427] Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan on the cover of his album *The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan*. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including "[Don't Think Twice It's All Right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Think_Twice_It%27s_All_Right "Don't Think Twice It's All Right")". The relationship ended in 1964.[^428] In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, *A Freewheelin' Time*.[^429]

#### Joan Baez

When [Joan Baez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez "Joan Baez") met Dylan in April 1961, she had already released her [first album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez_\(album\) "Joan Baez (album)") and was acclaimed as the "Queen of Folk".[^430] On hearing Dylan perform his song "[With God on Our Side](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_God_on_Our_Side_\(song\) "With God on Our Side (song)")", Baez later said, "I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad".[^431] In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets over the next two years.[^graybaez-432] By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film *[Dont Look Back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont_Look_Back "Dont Look Back")*.[^graybaez-432] Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76. Baez also starred as "The Woman In White" in the film *Renaldo and Clara* (1978), directed by Dylan.[^433] Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with [Carlos Santana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana "Carlos Santana").[^graybaez-432]

Baez recalled her relationship with Dylan in [Martin Scorsese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese "Martin Scorsese")'s documentary film *No Direction Home* (2005). Baez wrote about Dylan in two autobiographies—admiringly in *Daybreak* (1968), and less admiringly in *And A Voice to Sing With* (1987). Her song "[Diamonds & Rust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_%26_Rust_\(song\) "Diamonds & Rust (song)")" has been described as "an acute portrait" of Dylan.[^graybaez-432]

#### Sara Lownds

Dylan married [Sara Lownds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Lownds "Sara Lownds"), who had worked as a model and secretary at [Drew Associates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Drew "Robert Drew"), on November 22, 1965.[^gray198-434] They had four children: [Jesse Byron Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Dylan "Jesse Dylan") (born January 6, 1966), Anna Lea (born July 11, 1967), Samuel Isaac Abram (born July 30, 1968), and [Jakob Luke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Dylan "Jakob Dylan") (born December 9, 1969). Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan, born October 21, 1961). Sara Dylan played the role of Clara in Dylan's film *Renaldo and Clara* (1978). Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29, 1977.[^gray198-434]

#### Carolyn Dennis

Dylan and his backing singer [Carolyn Dennis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Dennis "Carolyn Dennis") (often professionally known as Carol Dennis) have a daughter, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, born on January 31, 1986.[^435] The couple were married on June 4, 1986, and divorced in October 1992. Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of [Howard Sounes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Sounes "Howard Sounes")'s biography *Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan*, in 2001.[^436]

### Home

When not touring, Dylan is believed to live primarily in [Point Dume](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Dume "Point Dume"), a promontory on the coast of [Malibu, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California "Malibu, California"), though he owns property around the world.[^437][^marty-438]

### Religious beliefs

Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small, close-knit Jewish community, and Dylan had his [Bar Mitzvah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Mitzvah "Bar Mitzvah") in May 1954.[^439][^haaretz-20] Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi [Meir Kahane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Kahane "Meir Kahane"), founder of the New York-based [Jewish Defense League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League "Jewish Defense League").[^440]

In the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the [Vineyard School of Discipleship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard_Christian_Fellowship "Vineyard Christian Fellowship").[^vineyard-204] Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying yes, he did in fact want Christ in his life. And he prayed that day and received the Lord".[^441][^442] From January to March 1979, Dylan attended Vineyard's Bible study classes in [Reseda, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseda,_California "Reseda, California").[^vineyard-204][^443]

By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the "[born again](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_again_\(Christianity\) "Born again (Christianity)")" label. He told [Kurt Loder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Loder "Kurt Loder") of *Rolling Stone*: "I've never said I'm 'born again'. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come."[^444] In 1997, he told [David Gates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gates_\(author\) "David Gates (author)") of *[Newsweek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek "Newsweek")*:

> Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like "Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain" or "[I Saw the Light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_Light_\(Hank_Williams_song\) "I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)")"—that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.[^445]

Dylan has supported the [Chabad Lubavitch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad "Chabad") movement,[^446] and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including his sons' Bar Mitzvahs and services at [Hadar Hatorah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadar_Hatorah "Hadar Hatorah"), a [Chabad Lubavitch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad_Lubavitch "Chabad Lubavitch") [yeshiva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva "Yeshiva"). In 1989 and 1991, he appeared on the Chabad [telethon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon "Telethon").[^447]

Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has made passing references to his religious faith, such as in a 2004 interview with *[60 Minutes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes "60 Minutes")*, when he told [Ed Bradley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bradley "Ed Bradley"), "the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God". He explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the "chief commander—in this earth and in the world we can't see".[^60minutes2005-39]

Speaking to Jeff Slate of *[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")* in December 2022, Dylan reaffirmed his religious outlook: "I read the scriptures a lot, meditate and pray, light candles in church. I believe in damnation and salvation as well as [predestination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination "Predestination"). The [Five Books of Moses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Books_of_Moses "Five Books of Moses"), [Pauline Epistles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Epistles "Pauline Epistles"), [Invocation of the Saints](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercession_of_saints "Intercession of saints"), all of it."[^448][^449]

## Style and influences

Initially modeling his style on [Woody Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie "Woody Guthrie")'s [folk songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music "American folk music"),[^chronicles243-450] [Robert Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson_\(musician\) "Robert Johnson (musician)")'s [blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues")[^chronicles281-451] and what he called the "architectural forms" of [Hank Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams "Hank Williams")'s [country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music") songs,[^chronicles95-22] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it "with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry".[^encbr-6] His lyrics incorporated political, social, and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning [counterculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s").[^452] Dylan's move from acoustic folk and [blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues") music to rock contributed to the development of [folk rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_rock "Folk rock"), as his musical and lyrical output grew in complexity.

## Accolades and honors

## Legacy

Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the [*Time* 100: The Most Important People of the Century](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100:_The_Most_Important_People_of_the_Century "Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century"), where he was called "master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation".[^time100dylan-470] [Paul Simon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Simon "Paul Simon") suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: "\[Dylan's\] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while."[^471]

For many critics, Dylan's greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums—*Bringing It All Back Home*, *Highway 61 Revisited* and *Blonde on Blonde*. In [Mike Marqusee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Marqusee "Mike Marqusee")'s words:

> Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, [British beat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_beat "British beat"), [symbolist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolism_\(movement\) "Symbolism (movement)"), [modernist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist_poetry_in_English "Modernist poetry in English") and [Beat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_poetry "Beat poetry") poetry, [surrealism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism") and [Dada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada "Dada"), advertising jargon and social commentary, [Fellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellini "Fellini") and [*Mad* magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_magazine "Mad magazine"), he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.[^marqusee139-472]

[Michael Gray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gray_\(author\) "Michael Gray (author)") initiated serious critical scrutiny when he published *Song & Dance Man: The Art of Bob Dylan* in 1972, situating Dylan’s work in the context of the English literary tradition, [Donne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne "John Donne"), [Browning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning "Robert Browning") and [T. S. Eliot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot "T. S. Eliot").[^473] Also in 1972, [Craig McGregor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_McGregor "Craig McGregor") published *Bob Dylan: A Retrospective*, an anthology containing critical essays about Dylan by [Robert Shelton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shelton_\(critic\) "Robert Shelton (critic)"), [Nat Hentoff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Hentoff "Nat Hentoff"), [Ellen Willis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Willis "Ellen Willis") and other contemporary cultural critics. In 1998, [Stanford University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan held in the United States.[^474] In 2004, [Richard F. Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_F._Thomas "Richard F. Thomas"), [Classics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics") professor at [Harvard University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University"), created a freshman seminar titled "Dylan", which aimed "to put the artist in context of not just popular culture of the last half-century, but the tradition of classical poets like [Virgil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil "Virgil") and [Homer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer")."[^475] Thomas went on to publish *Why Bob Dylan Matters*, exploring Dylan's connections with [Greco-Roman literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity").[^476]

Literary critic [Christopher Ricks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Ricks "Christopher Ricks") published *[Dylan's Visions of Sin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan%27s_Visions_of_Sin "Dylan's Visions of Sin")*, an appreciation of Dylan's work.[^477] Following Dylan's Nobel win, Ricks reflected: "I'd not have written a book about Dylan, to stand alongside my books on [Milton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton "John Milton") and [Keats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats "John Keats"), [Tennyson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson "Alfred, Lord Tennyson") and T.S. Eliot, if I didn't think Dylan a genius of and with language."[^478] The critical consensus that Dylan's songwriting was his outstanding creative achievement was articulated by *[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica")*: "Hailed as the [Shakespeare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare "Shakespeare") of his generation, Dylan ... set the standard for lyric writing."[^encbr-6] Former British [poet laureate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet_laureate "Poet laureate") [Andrew Motion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Motion "Andrew Motion") said Dylan's lyrics should be studied in schools.[^479] His lyrics have entered the vernacular; [Edna Gundersen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Gundersen "Edna Gundersen") notes that

> Lines that branded Dylan a poet and counterculture valedictorian in the '60s are imprinted on the culture: "When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose"; "a hard rain's a-gonna fall"; "to live outside the law you must be honest." Some lyrics — "you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows" and "the times they are a-changin' " — appear in *[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett%27s_Familiar_Quotations "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations")*.[^gund2001-480]

*[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* ranked Dylan first on its 2015 list of the [100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_100_Greatest_Songwriters_of_All_Time "Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"),[^rolling_stone_100_greatest_songwriters-481] fifteenth on its 2023 list of the Greatest Singers of All Time,[^482] and placed "[Like A Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_A_Rolling_Stone "Like A Rolling Stone")" first on their [list of greatest songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time "Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time") in 2004 and 2011.[^lars-9] He was listed second on the magazine's [list of the hundred greatest artists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_100_Greatest_Artists_of_All_Time "Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time").[^483] The *Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll* writes that "His lyrics—the first in rock to be seriously regarded as literature—became so well known that politicians from [Jimmy Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter "Jimmy Carter") to [Václav Havel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Havel "Václav Havel") have cited them as an influence."[^:r&rencylopedia-245]

Dylan's voice also received critical attention. [Robert Shelton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shelton_\(critic\) "Robert Shelton (critic)") described his early vocal style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [Dave Van Ronk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Van_Ronk "Dave Van Ronk")'s".[^484] His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; [Michael Gray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gray_\(author\) "Michael Gray (author)") described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on "[Like a Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone "Like a Rolling Stone")" as "at once young and jeeringly cynical".[^485] As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal *[Oral Tradition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Tradition_\(journal\) "Oral Tradition (journal)")*:

> Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in "[Everything is Broken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_Broken "Everything is Broken")" (on the album *[Oh Mercy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Mercy "Oh Mercy")*) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.[^486]

Among musicians who have acknowledged his influence are [John Lennon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon "John Lennon"),[^487] [Paul McCartney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney "Paul McCartney"),[^488] [Jerry Garcia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia"),[^489] [Pete Townshend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend "Pete Townshend"),[^490] [Syd Barrett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett "Syd Barrett"),[^491] [Joni Mitchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell "Joni Mitchell"),[^492] [Neil Young](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young "Neil Young"),[^493] [Bruce Springsteen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen "Bruce Springsteen"),[^:sprinsgteen-114] [David Bowie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie"),[^494][^gund2001-480] [Bryan Ferry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ferry "Bryan Ferry"),[^495] [Patti Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith "Patti Smith"),[^496] [Joe Strummer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer "Joe Strummer"),[^497] [Bono](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono "Bono"),[^498][^gund2001-480] [Nick Cave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave "Nick Cave"),[^499] [Leonard Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen "Leonard Cohen"),[^500] [Tom Waits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits "Tom Waits"),[^501] [Ole Paus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Paus "Ole Paus")[^502] and [Chuck D](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_D "Chuck D").[^503][^gund2001-480] Dylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both [the Byrds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds "The Byrds") and [the Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band "The Band"): the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of "[Mr. Tambourine Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Tambourine_Man#The_Byrds'_version "Mr. Tambourine Man")" and the [subsequent album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Tambourine_Man_\(album\) "Mr. Tambourine Man (album)"), while the Band were Dylan's backing band [on his 1966 tour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_World_Tour_1966 "Bob Dylan World Tour 1966"), recorded *The Basement Tapes* with him in 1967[^504] and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their [debut album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_From_Big_Pink "Music From Big Pink").[^505] [Johnny Cash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash "Johnny Cash"), introducing "Wanted Man", said "I don't have to tell you who Bob Dylan is—the greatest writer of our time."[^506]

Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book *Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom*, [Nik Cohn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik_Cohn "Nik Cohn") objected: "I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype".[^507] Australian critic [Jack Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Marx "Jack Marx") credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: "What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from [Mick Jagger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger "Mick Jagger") to [Eminem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem "Eminem") educating themselves from the Dylan handbook".[^508]

Fellow musicians have also expressed critical views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a "plagiarist" and his voice as "fake" in a 2010 interview in the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")*.[^509][^510][^511] Mitchell's comments led to discussions on Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him.[^512] Talking to [Mikal Gilmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikal_Gilmore "Mikal Gilmore") in *Rolling Stone* in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album *Modern Times*,[^nyttimrod-290] by saying that it was "part of the tradition".[^513][^514]

Dylan's music has inspired artists in other fields. [Dave Gibbons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Gibbons "Dave Gibbons") recalls how he and [Alan Moore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore "Alan Moore") were inspired by the lines of "[Desolation Row](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desolation_Row "Desolation Row")" beginning "At midnight, all the agents/ And the superhuman crew...":

> It was a glimpse, a mere fragment of something; something ominous, paranoid and threatening. But something that showed that comics, like poetry or rock and roll or Bob Dylan himself, might feasibly become part of the greater cultural continuum. The lines must have also lodged in Alan's consciousness for, nearly twenty years later, Dylan's words eventually provided the title of the first issue of our comic book series *[Watchmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen "Watchmen").*[^515]

In 2007, [Todd Haynes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes "Todd Haynes") released *[I'm Not There](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Not_There "I'm Not There")*, "inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan".[^variety-07-516] The movie used six actors, [Christian Bale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale "Christian Bale"), [Cate Blanchett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Blanchett "Cate Blanchett"), [Marcus Carl Franklin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Carl_Franklin "Marcus Carl Franklin"), [Richard Gere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gere "Richard Gere"), [Heath Ledger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Ledger "Heath Ledger") and [Ben Whishaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Whishaw "Ben Whishaw"), to explore different facets of Dylan's life.[^variety-07-516][^517] Dylan's previously unreleased 1967 song from which the film takes its name[^518] was included on the [original soundtrack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Not_There_\(soundtrack\) "I'm Not There (soundtrack)") along with covers of Dylan songs by such diverse artists as [Sonic Youth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth "Sonic Youth"), [Calexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calexico_\(band\) "Calexico (band)") and [Yo La Tengo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_La_Tengo "Yo La Tengo"). Irish playwright [Conor McPherson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McPherson "Conor McPherson") wrote and directed the musical [*Girl from the North Country*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_from_the_North_Country_\(musical\) "Girl from the North Country (musical)"), which used Dylan's songs to tell the stories of various characters during the [Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") years, set in Dylan's birthplace, [Duluth, Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota "Duluth, Minnesota"). The play premiered in London in 2017.[^519][^520]

If Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,[^marqusee139-472] critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. In his review of *I'm Not There*, [J. Hoberman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hoberman "J. Hoberman") wrote:

> Elvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.[^521]

Dylan's rise to stardom, from his arrival in New York in 1961 to his [controversial performance at Newport in 1965](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy "Electric Dylan controversy"), was portrayed by the feature film *[A Complete Unknown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Complete_Unknown "A Complete Unknown")*, which opened in the U.S. on December 25, 2024.[^522][^523] The film garnered generally favorable reviews, with praise for actor [Timothée Chalamet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth%C3%A9e_Chalamet "Timothée Chalamet") in the role of Dylan.[^524]

## Archives and recognition

## Visual art

Dylan's visual art was first seen by the public via a painting he contributed for the cover of [The Band](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band "The Band")'s *[Music from Big Pink](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_from_Big_Pink "Music from Big Pink")* album in 1968.[^536] The cover of Dylan's own 1970 album [*Self Portrait*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_Portrait_\(Bob_Dylan_album\) "Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)") features the painting of a human face by Dylan.[^537] More of Dylan's artwork was revealed with the 1973 publication of his book *[Writings and Drawings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writings_and_Drawings "Writings and Drawings")*.[^538] The cover of Dylan's 1974 album *[Planet Waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Waves "Planet Waves")* again featured one of his paintings. In 1994 [Random House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_House "Random House") published *Drawn Blank*, a book of Dylan's drawings.[^539] In 2007, the first public exhibition of Dylan's paintings, *The Drawn Blank Series*, opened at the Kunstsammlungen in [Chemnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemnitz "Chemnitz"), Germany;[^encyclopediadrawn-540] it showcased more than 200 watercolors and [gouaches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouache "Gouache") made from the original drawings. The exhibition coincided with the publication of *Bob Dylan: The Drawn Blank Series*, which includes 170 reproductions from the series.[^encyclopediadrawn-540][^nytimesartist-541] From September 2010 until April 2011, the [National Gallery of Denmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statens_Museum_for_Kunst "Statens Museum for Kunst") exhibited 40 large-scale acrylic paintings by Dylan, *The Brazil Series*.[^542]

In July 2011, a leading contemporary art gallery, [Gagosian Gallery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagosian_Gallery "Gagosian Gallery"), announced their representation of Dylan's paintings.[^543] An exhibition of Dylan's art, *The Asia Series*, opened at the Gagosian Madison Avenue Gallery on September 20, displaying Dylan's paintings of scenes in China and the Far East.[^544] *The New York Times* reported that "some fans and Dylanologists have raised questions about whether some of these paintings are based on the singer's own experiences and observations, or on photographs that are widely available and were not taken by Mr. Dylan". *The Times* pointed to close resemblances between Dylan's paintings and historic photos of Japan and China, and photos taken by [Dmitri Kessel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Kessel "Dmitri Kessel") and [Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson "Henri Cartier-Bresson").[^545] Art critic [Blake Gopnik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Gopnik "Blake Gopnik") has defended Dylan's artistic practice, arguing: "Ever since the birth of photography, painters have used it as the basis for their works: [Edgar Degas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas "Edgar Degas") and [Édouard Vuillard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Vuillard "Édouard Vuillard") and other favorite artists—even [Edvard Munch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch "Edvard Munch")—all took or used photos as sources for their art, sometimes barely altering them".[^546] The [Magnum photo agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Photos "Magnum Photos") confirmed that Dylan had licensed the reproduction rights of these photographs.[^547]

Dylan's second show at the Gagosian Gallery, *Revisionist Art*, opened in November 2012. The show consisted of thirty paintings, transforming and satirizing popular magazines, including *[Playboy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy "Playboy")* and *[Babytalk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babytalk_\(magazine\) "Babytalk (magazine)")*.[^548][^549] In February 2013, Dylan exhibited the *New Orleans Series* of paintings at the [Palazzo Reale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Palace_of_Milan "Royal Palace of Milan") in Milan.[^550] In August 2013, Britain's [National Portrait Gallery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Portrait_Gallery,_London "National Portrait Gallery, London") in London hosted Dylan's first major UK exhibition, *Face Value*, featuring twelve pastel portraits.[^551]

In November 2013, the [Halcyon Gallery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halcyon_Gallery "Halcyon Gallery") in London mounted *Mood Swings*, an exhibition in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement released by the gallery, Dylan said

> I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.[^552][^553]

In November 2016, the Halcyon Gallery featured a collection of drawings, watercolors and acrylic works by Dylan. The exhibition, *The Beaten Path*, depicted American landscapes and urban scenes, inspired by Dylan's travels across the US.[^554] The show was reviewed by *[Vanity Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\(magazine\) "Vanity Fair (magazine)")* and *[Asia Times Online](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Times_Online "Asia Times Online")*.[^555][^556][^557] In October 2018, the Halcyon Gallery mounted an exhibition of Dylan's drawings, *Mondo Scripto*. The works consisted of Dylan hand-written lyrics of his songs, with each song illustrated by a drawing.[^558]

*Retrospectrum*, the largest retrospective of Dylan's visual art to date, consisting of over 250 works in a variety of media, debuted at the Modern Art Museum in Shanghai in 2019.[^559] Building on the exhibition in China, a version of *Retrospectrum*, which includes a new series of paintings, "Deep Focus", drawn from film imagery,[^560] opened at the [Frost Art Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_Art_Museum "Frost Art Museum") in Miami on November 30, 2021.[^561]

Since 1994, Dylan has published [nine books of paintings and drawings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_bibliography#Art_books_by_Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan bibliography").[^562] In November 2022, Dylan apologized for using an [autopen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopen "Autopen") to sign books and artwork which were subsequently sold as "hand-signed" since 2019.[^563][^564]

## Written works

Dylan has published [*Tarantula*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_\(poetry_collection\) "Tarantula (poetry collection)"), a work of [prose poetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_poetry "Prose poetry"); *[Chronicles: Volume One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles:_Volume_One "Chronicles: Volume One")*, the first part of his memoirs; several books of the lyrics of his songs, and nine books of his art. Dylan's third full length book, *[The Philosophy of Modern Song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Modern_Song "The Philosophy of Modern Song")*, which contains 66 essays on songs by other artists, was published on November 1, 2022. Dylan has also been the subject of numerous biographies and critical studies.
