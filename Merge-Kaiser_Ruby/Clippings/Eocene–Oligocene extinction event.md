The **Eocene–Oligocene extinction event**, also called the **Eocene-Oligocene transition** (**EOT**) or ***Grande Coupure*** ([French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") for "great cut"), is the transition between the end of the [Eocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene") and the beginning of the [Oligocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene "Oligocene"), an extinction event and faunal turnover occurring between 33.9 and 33.4 million years ago.[^ebrobasin-1] It was marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover, although it was relatively minor in comparison to the [largest mass extinctions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event "Extinction event").[^coolerwinters-2]
