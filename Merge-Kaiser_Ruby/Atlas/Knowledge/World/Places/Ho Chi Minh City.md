**Ho Chi Minh City** (**HCMC**; [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language"): *Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh*, IPA:[\[tʰan˨˩fow˦˥how˨˩cɪj˦˥mɨn˧˧\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Vietnamese "Help:IPA/Vietnamese")), also known as **Saigon** ([Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language"): *Sài Gòn*, IPA:[\[saːjɣɔ̂n\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Vietnamese "Help:IPA/Vietnamese")), is the most populous city in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam") with a population of 14,002,598 in 2025.[^10]

The city's geography is defined by rivers and canals, of which the largest is [Saigon River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_River "Saigon River"). As the largest [financial centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre "Financial centre") in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City has the largest [gross regional domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_regional_domestic_product "Gross regional domestic product") out of all Vietnam provinces and municipalities,[^13] contributing around a quarter of the [country's total GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Vietnam "Economy of Vietnam").[^14] [Ho Chi Minh City's metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_metropolitan_area "Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area") is [ASEAN's 5th largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ASEAN_country_subdivisions_by_GDP "List of ASEAN country subdivisions by GDP"), also the biggest outside an [ASEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN "ASEAN") country capital.

The area was initially part of [Cambodian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "Cambodia") states until it became part of the Vietnamese [Nguyễn lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_lords "Nguyễn lords") in 1698, due to [Đại Việt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i_Vi%E1%BB%87t "Đại Việt") 's expansionist policy of *[Nam tiến](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_ti%E1%BA%BFn "Nam tiến")*. It was capital of the Nguyễn lords at the end of their existence before the [Nguyễn dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_dynasty "Nguyễn dynasty") was formed. After the fall of the [Citadel of Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_of_Saigon "Citadel of Saigon"), it became the capital of [French Cochinchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Cochinchina "French Cochinchina") from 1862 to 1949.

It was also the capital of [French Indochina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina "French Indochina") from 1887 to 1902, and again from 1945 until its cessation in 1954. After France [recognized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_Accords "Élysée Accords") Vietnam's independence and unity,[^1] it was the capital of the [State of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Vietnam "State of Vietnam") from 1949 to 1955. Following the [1954 partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Geneva_Conference "1954 Geneva Conference"), it became the capital of [South Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam "South Vietnam") until it was [captured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon "Fall of Saigon") by [North Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam "North Vietnam"), who created a unified [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") in 1976 and renamed the city after their former leader [Ho Chi Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh "Ho Chi Minh"), though the former name is still widely used in informal usages. Beginning in the 1990s, the city underwent rapid expansion and modernization, which contributed to [Vietnam's post-war economic recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%95i_M%E1%BB%9Bi "Đổi Mới") and helped revive its [international trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade "International trade") hub status.

Ho Chi Minh City has a long tradition of being one of the centers of economy, entertainment and education in [Southern Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Vietnam "Southern Vietnam") in particular and Vietnam in general. It is also the busiest international [transport hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_hub "Transport hub") in Vietnam, with [Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Son_Nhat_International_Airport "Tan Son Nhat International Airport") accounting for nearly half of all international arrivals to Vietnam and the [Port of Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_Port "Saigon Port") among the [busiest container ports in Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_container_ports "List of busiest container ports").[^16] [^17]

The city is also a tourist attraction; some of its [historic landmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historic_buildings_in_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "List of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City") with modern landmarks, including the [Independence Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Palace "Independence Palace"), [Bitexco Financial Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitexco_Financial_Tower "Bitexco Financial Tower"), [Landmark 81 Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_81 "Landmark 81"), the [War Remnants Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Remnants_Museum "War Remnants Museum"), [Bến Thành Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%BFn_Th%C3%A0nh_Market "Bến Thành Market"), et cetera. The city is also known for its narrow walkable [alleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hem_\(alleyway\) "Hem (alleyway)") and bustling [night life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightlife "Nightlife"), notable is the [Phạm Ngũ Lão Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%E1%BA%A1m_Ng%C5%A9_L%C3%A3o,_District_1 "Phạm Ngũ Lão, District 1") and the Bùi Viện street in the ward. Since 2025, when [Bình Dương](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_province "Bình Dương province") and [Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A0_R%E1%BB%8Ba%E2%80%93V%C5%A9ng_T%C3%A0u_province "Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province") provinces were merged into Ho Chi Minh City, the city has officially become a megacity, while inheriting major [industrial towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_city "Industrial city") and [coastal cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C5%A9ng_T%C3%A0u "Vũng Tàu") from the two former provinces. Currently, Ho Chi Minh City is facing increasing threats of [sea level rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise") and [flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood "Flood") as well as heavy strains on public infrastructures.

## Etymology

The first known human habitation in the area was either a [Cham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chams "Chams") settlement called Baigaur,[^2] or a Cambodian city named Prey Nokor,[^18] which was a small fishing village.[^19] [^20] Over time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed [Gia Định](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Dinh "Gia Dinh") ([嘉](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%98%89 "wikt:嘉") [定](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%9A "wikt:定")) in 1698, a name that was retained until the time of the [French conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochinchina_Campaign "Cochinchina Campaign") in the 1860s, when it adopted the name *Sài Gòn*, [francized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francization "Francization") as *Saïgon*,[^20] although the city was still indicated as [嘉](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%98%89 "wiktionary:嘉") [定](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%9A "wiktionary:定") on Vietnamese maps written in [chữ Hán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%AF_H%C3%A1n "Chữ Hán") until at least 1891.[^21]

The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after [reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_Day "Reunification Day") in 1976 to honour [Ho Chi Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh "Ho Chi Minh").[^3] Even today, however, the informal name of *Sài Gòn* remains in daily speech. However, there is a technical difference between the two terms: *Sài Gòn* is commonly used to refer to the city centre in [District 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_1,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 1, Ho Chi Minh City") and the adjacent areas, while *Ho Chi Minh City* refers to all of its urban and rural districts.[^20]

### Saigon

![[~/×/cff7aa5c4b64a6d0d11fa76fefeebca0_MD5.jpg|250]]

Saigon is written here as 柴棍 along with other Southern Vietnamese cities. (On the left of the page, first row after " 城庯三 ")

The original toponym behind Sài Gòn was attested earliest as 柴棍, with two phonograms whose Sino-Vietnamese readings are sài and côn respectively, in Lê Quý Đôn's "Miscellaneous Chronicles of the Pacified Frontier" (撫邊雜錄, *Phủ biên tạp lục* c. 1776), wherein Lê relates that, in 1674, Cambodian prince [Ang Nan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Nan "Ang Nan") was installed as [uparaja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uparaja "Uparaja") in 柴棍 (Sài Gòn) by Vietnamese forces.

柴棍 also appears later in Trịnh Hoài Đức's "Comprehensive Records about the Gia Định Citadel" (嘉定城通志, *Gia Định thành thông chí*, c. 1820), "Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country" (南國地輿教科書, *Nam quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư*, 1908),[^23] etc.

Adrien Launay's Histoire de la Mission de Cochinchine (1688–1823), "Documents Historiques II: 1728 – 1771" (1924: [190](https://books.google.com/books?id=zZ6AAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA190)) cites 1747 documents containing the toponyms: provincia Rai-gon, Rai-gon thong (for \*Sài Gòn thượng "Upper Saigon"), & Rai-gon-ha (for \*Sài Gòn hạ "Lower Saigon").

It is probably a transcription of Khmer ព្រៃនគរ (Prey Nokôr) [^24] [^25] [^4], or Khmer ព្រៃគរ (Prey Kôr).

The proposal that Sài Gòn is from non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of Chinese 堤岸 ("embankment", *tai4 ngon6*, SV: đê ngạn) [^5], the [Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Chinese "Yue Chinese") name of [Chợ Lớn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%A3_L%E1%BB%9Bn "Chợ Lớn"), (e.g. by Vương Hồng Sển) has been critiqued as folk-etymological, as: (1) the Vietnamese source Phủ biên tạp lục (albeit written in literary Chinese) was the earliest extant one containing the local toponym's transcription; (2) 堤岸 has variant form 提岸, thus suggesting that both were transcriptions of a local toponym and thus are cognates to, not originals of, Sài Gòn. Saigon is unlikely to be from 堤岸 since in "Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country", it also lists [Chợ Lớn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%A3_L%E1%BB%9Bn "Chợ Lớn") as 𢄂𢀲 separate from 柴棍 Sài Gòn.

The current official name, **Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh**, was first proclaimed in 1945, and later adopted in 1976. It is abbreviated as TP.HCM, and translated in English as *Ho Chi Minh City*, abbreviated as HCMC, and in French as **Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville** (the [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") is sometimes omitted), abbreviated as HCMV.

The name commemorates [Ho Chi Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh "Ho Chi Minh"), the first leader of [North Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam "North Vietnam"). This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, [胡](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%83%A1 "wiktionary:胡")) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from [Sino-Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_vocabulary "Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary"), [志](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BF%97 "wiktionary:志") [明](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E "wiktionary:明"); Chí meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "light bringer".[^28]

Nowadays, "Saigon" is still used as a semi-official name for the city, in some cases being used interchangeably with Ho Chi Minh City, partly due to its long history and familiarity.[^29]

## History

### Early settlement

The earliest settlement in the area was a [Funan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funan "Funan") temple at the location of the current Phụng Sơn Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD.[^30] A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the [Champa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champa "Champa").[^30] Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor after conquest by the [Khmer Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire "Khmer Empire") around 1145,[^30] Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest.[^31]

The first [Vietnamese people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people "Vietnamese people") crossed the sea to explore this land completely without the organisation of the [Nguyễn Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Lords "Nguyễn Lords"). Thanks to the marriage between Princess [Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Ph%C3%BAc_Ng%E1%BB%8Dc_V%E1%BA%A1n "Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn") – daughter of Lord [Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Ph%C3%BAc_Nguy%C3%AAn "Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên") – and the King of Cambodia  [Chey Chettha II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chey_Chettha_II "Chey Chettha II") in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move back and forth. In exchange, Chey Chettha II gifted Prei Nokor to the [Nguyễn lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_lords "Nguyễn lords").[^32] Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of Saigon, Đồng Nai. Before that, the Funanese, Khmer, and Cham had lived there, scattered from time immemorial.

The period from 1623 to 1698 is considered the period of the formation of later Saigon. In 1623, Lord Nguyen sent a mission to ask his son-in-law, King Chey Chettha II, to set up tax collection stations in Prey Nokor (Sài Gòn) and Kas Krobei (Bến Nghé). Although this was a deserted jungle area, it was located on the traffic routes between Vietnam, Cambodia, and Siam. The next two important events of this period were the establishment of the barracks and residence of Vice King [Ang Non](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Non "Ang Non") and the establishment of a palace at Tân Mỹ (near the present-day Cống Quỳnh–Nguyễn Trãi crossroads). It can be said that Saigon was formed from these three government agencies.

In 1679, Lord [Nguyễn Phúc Tần](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Ph%C3%BAc_T%E1%BA%A7n "Nguyễn Phúc Tần") allowed a group of Chinese refugees from the [Qing dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") to settle in [Mỹ Tho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Tho "My Tho"), [Biên Hòa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_Hoa "Bien Hoa") and Saigon to seek refuge. In 1698, [Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_H%E1%BB%AFu_C%E1%BA%A3nh "Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh"), a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of [Huế](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%E1%BA%BF "Huế") by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement.[^33] [^34] King [Chey Chettha IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chey_Chettha_IV "Chey Chettha IV") of Cambodia tried to stop the Vietnamese but was defeated by Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in 1700. In February 1700, he invaded Cambodia from [An Giang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Giang "An Giang"). In March, the Vietnamese expedition under Cảnh and a Chinese general [Trần Thượng Xuyên](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A7n_Th%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3ng_Xuy%C3%AAn "Trần Thượng Xuyên") (Chen Shangchuan) defeated the main Cambodian army at Bích Đôi citadel, king Chey Chettha IV took flight while his nephew [Ang Em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Em "Ang Em") surrendered to the invaders, as the Vietnamese marched onto and captured Cambodia's capital [Phnom Penh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh "Phnom Penh").[^35] As a result, Saigon and [Long An](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_An "Long An") were officially and securely obtained by the Nguyễn, more Vietnamese settlers moved into the new conquered lands.[^35]

In 1788, [Nguyễn Ánh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Long "Gia Long") captured the city, and used it as a centre of resistance against Tây Sơn.[^36] Two years later, a large [Vauban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauban "Vauban") citadel called [Gia Định](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_of_Saigon "Citadel of Saigon"), or *Thành Bát Quái* ("Eight Diagrams") was built by Victor [Olivier de Puymanel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_de_Puymanel "Olivier de Puymanel"), one of the [Nguyễn Ánh's French mercenaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_assistance_to_Nguy%E1%BB%85n_%C3%81nh "French assistance to Nguyễn Ánh").[^37] The citadel was captured by [Lê Văn Khôi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%AA_V%C4%83n_Kh%C3%B4i "Lê Văn Khôi") during [his revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%AA_V%C4%83n_Kh%C3%B4i_revolt "Lê Văn Khôi revolt") of 1833–35 against Emperor [Minh Mạng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_M%E1%BA%A1ng "Minh Mạng"). Following the revolt, Minh Mạng ordered it to be dismantled, and a new citadel, called *Phụng Thành*, was built in 1836.[^38] In 1859, the citadel was destroyed by the French following the [Battle of Kỳ Hòa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ky_Hoa "Battle of Ky Hoa").[^38] Initially called Gia Định, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.[^30]

Ceded to France by the 1862 [Treaty of Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Saigon_\(1862\) "Treaty of Saigon (1862)"),[^39] the city was planned by the French to transform into a large town for colonization. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, construction of various French-style buildings began, including a [botanical garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_Zoo_and_Botanical_Gardens "Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens"), the [Norodom Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norodom_Palace "Norodom Palace"), [Hotel Continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Continental_Saigon "Hotel Continental Saigon"), [Notre-Dame Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_Cathedral_Basilica_of_Saigon "Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon"), and [Bến Thành Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%BFn_Th%C3%A0nh_Market "Bến Thành Market"), among many others.[^40] [^41] In April 1865, [Gia Định Báo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Dinh_Bao "Gia Dinh Bao") was established in Saigon, becoming the first newspaper published in Vietnam.[^42] During the French colonial era, Saigon became known as "Pearl of the Orient" (**Hòn ngọc Viễn Đông**),[^43] or "Paris of the Extreme Orient".[^44]

On 27 April 1931, a new [région](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9gion "Région") called **Saigon–Cholon** consisting of Saigon and Cholon was formed; the name Cholon was dropped after South Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955.[^45] From about 256,000 in 1930,[^46] Saigon's population rose to 1.2 million in 1950.[^46]

On 14 June 1949, 10 days after France returned [Cochinchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Cochinchina "French Cochinchina") to Vietnam, former Emperor [Bảo Đại](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%A3o_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i "Bảo Đại") made Saigon the capital of the [State of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Vietnam "State of Vietnam") within the [French Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Union "French Union") with himself as head of state.[^47] The state was proclaimed in July. In July 1954, the [Geneva Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Geneva_Conference "1954 Geneva Conference") partitioned Vietnam [along](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_Demilitarized_Zone "Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone") the [17th parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_parallel_north "17th parallel north") ([Bến Hải River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%BFn_H%E1%BA%A3i_River "Bến Hải River")), with the [Việt Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Minh "Viet Minh"), under [Ho Chi Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh "Ho Chi Minh"), gaining complete control of [the northern half of the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam "North Vietnam"), while the southern half remained the rule of the State of Vietnam.[^48]

The State officially became the [Republic of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam "Republic of Vietnam") when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister [Ngô Đình Diệm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m "Ngô Đình Diệm") in the 1955 [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_State_of_Vietnam_referendum "1955 State of Vietnam referendum"),[^48] with Saigon as its capital.[^49] On 22 October 1956, the city was given the official name, **Đô Thành Sài Gòn** ("Capital City Saigon").[^50] After the decree of 27 March 1959 came into effect, Saigon was divided into eight districts and 41 wards.[^50]

In December 1966, two wards from old An Khánh Commune of Gia Định, were formed into District 1, then seceded shortly later to become District 9.[^51] In July 1969, District 10 and District 11 were founded, and by 1975, the city's area consisted of eleven districts, [Gia Định](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh_Province "Gia Định Province"), [Củ Chi District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_District "Củ Chi District") ([Hậu Nghĩa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BA%ADu_Ngh%C4%A9a_Province "Hậu Nghĩa Province")), and [Phú Hòa District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%C3%BA_H%C3%B2a_District "Phú Hòa District") ([Bình Dương](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_Province "Bình Dương Province")).[^51]

Saigon served as the financial, industrial and transport centre of the Republic of Vietnam.[^52] In the late 1950s, with the U.S. providing nearly $2 billion in aid to the Diệm regime, the country's economy grew rapidly under the [capitalist model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism");[^50] by 1960, over half of South Vietnam's factories were located in Saigon.[^53] However, beginning in the 1960s, Saigon experienced economic downturn and high inflation, as it was completely dependent on U.S. aid and imports from other countries.[^50] As a result of widespread urbanisation, with the population reaching 3.3 million by 1970, the city was described by the [USAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development "United States Agency for International Development") as being turned "into a huge slum".[^54] The city also suffered from "prostitutes, drug addicts, corrupt officials, beggars, orphans, and Americans with money", and according to [Stanley Karnow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Karnow "Stanley Karnow"), it was "a black-market city in the largest sense of the word".[^49]

On 28 April 1955, the [Vietnamese National Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_National_Army "Vietnamese National Army") launched [an attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saigon_\(1955\) "Battle of Saigon (1955)") against [Bình Xuyên](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_Xuy%C3%AAn "Bình Xuyên") military force in the city. The battle lasted until May, killing an estimated 500 people and leaving about 20,000 homeless.[^49] [^55] Ngô Đình Diệm then later turned on other paramilitary groups in Saigon, including the [Hòa Hảo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B2a_H%E1%BA%A3o "Hòa Hảo") Buddhist reform movement.[^49] On 11 June 1963, Buddhist monk [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c "Thích Quảng Đức") self-immolated in the city, in protest of the Diệm regime. On 1 November of the same year, Diệm was [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_and_assassination_of_Ngo_Dinh_Diem "Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem") in Saigon, in a successful coup by [Dương Văn Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh "Dương Văn Minh").[^49]

During the 1968 [Tet Offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive "Tet Offensive"), communist forces launched a failed [attempt to capture the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saigon_\(1968\) "Battle of Saigon (1968)"). Seven years later, on 30 April 1975, [Saigon was captured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon "Fall of Saigon"), ending the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War") with a victory for North Vietnam,[^56] and the city came under the control of the [Vietnamese People's Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_People%27s_Army "Vietnamese People's Army").[^49]

In July 1976, upon the establishment of the unified [Socialist Republic of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Vietnam "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"), the city of Saigon (including the Cholon area), the province of Gia Ðịnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City, in honour of the late Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.[^6] At the time, the city covered an area of 1,295.5 square kilometres (500.2 sq mi) with eight districts and five rurals: [Thủ Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%A7_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_\(urban_district\) "Thủ Đức (urban district)"), [Hóc Môn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B3c_M%C3%B4n_District "Hóc Môn District"), [Củ Chi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_District "Củ Chi District"), [Bình Chánh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_Ch%C3%A1nh_District "Bình Chánh District"), and [Nhà Bè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nh%C3%A0_B%C3%A8_District "Nhà Bè District").[^51] Since 1978, administrative divisions in the city have been revised numerous times,[^51] most recently in 2020, when [District 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_2,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 2, Ho Chi Minh City"), [District 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 9, Ho Chi Minh City"), and [Thủ Đức District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%A7_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_\(urban_district\) "Thủ Đức (urban district)") were consolidated to form a [municipal city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%A7_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c "Thủ Đức").[^57]

On 29 October 2002, 60 people died and 90 were injured in the International Trade Center [building fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_ITC_fire "Ho Chi Minh City ITC fire") in Ho Chi Minh City.[^58] Today, Ho Chi Minh City, along with its surrounding provinces, is described as "the manufacturing hub" of Vietnam, and "an attractive business hub".[^59] In terms of cost, it was ranked the 178th-most expensive major city in the world according to the Mercer Cost Of Living 2024 survey of 226 cities.[^60] In terms of international connectedness, as of 2024, the city was classified as a "Beta+" city by the [Globalization and World Cities Research Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_and_World_Cities_Research_Network "Globalization and World Cities Research Network").[^61]

## Geography

![[~/×/70ae75fb9a80a2cb5e910edd32f0dffe_MD5.jpg]]

Population density and elevation above sea level in the city (2010). Ho Chi Minh City is vulnerable to sea level rise

The city is located in the [south-eastern region of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Vietnam "Southeast Vietnam"), 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of [Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi "Hanoi"). The average elevation is 5 m (16 ft) above sea level for the city centre and 16 m (52 ft) for the suburb areas.[^62] It borders [Tây Ninh Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2y_Ninh_Province "Tây Ninh Province") and [Bình Dương Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_Province "Bình Dương Province") to the north, [Đồng Nai Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng_Nai_Province "Đồng Nai Province") and [Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A0_R%E1%BB%8Ba%E2%80%93V%C5%A9ng_T%C3%A0u_province "Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province") to the east, [Long An Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_An_Province "Long An Province") to the west, [Tiền Giang Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tien_Giang_Province "Tien Giang Province") and [South China Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea "South China Sea") to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km <sup>2</sup> (809 sq mi) or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to [Củ Chi District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_District "Củ Chi District") (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to [Cần Giờ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BA%A7n_Gi%E1%BB%9D_District "Cần Giờ District") on the Eastern Sea.

The distance from the northernmost point (Phú Mỹ Hưng Commune, [Củ Chi District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_District "Củ Chi District")) to the southernmost one (Long Hòa Commune, Cần Giờ District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point ([Long Bình ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%A7_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c "Thủ Đức"), District Nine) to the westernmost one (Bình Chánh Commune, Bình Chánh District) is 47 km (29 mi). Due to its location on the Mekong Delta, the city is fringed by tidal flats that have been heavily modified for agriculture.[^63]

### Flooding

Saigon is considered one of the most vulnerable cities to the effects of [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), particularly flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the [Saigon River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_River "Saigon River") and [Đồng Nai River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Nai_River "Dong Nai River") and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city.[^64] [^65] A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to suffer flooding.[^66]

### Climate

The city has a [tropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate"), specifically [tropical savanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_savanna_climate "Tropical savanna climate") ([Aw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification")), with a high average humidity of 78–82%.[^69] The year is divided into two distinct seasons.[^69] The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 mm (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November.[^69] The dry season lasts from December to April.[^69]

The average temperature is 28 °C (82 °F), with little variation throughout the year.[^69] The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 °C (104 °F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 °C (57 °F) in January.[^69] On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.[^69]

Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Đôi and Tẻ Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011–14.[^123] In 2017, the [Saigon Waterbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_Waterbus "Saigon Waterbus") launched, connecting [District 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_1,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 1, Ho Chi Minh City") to [Thủ Đức City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%A7_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c "Thủ Đức").[^124]

### Public transport

#### Metro

The [HCMC Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCMC_Metro "HCMC Metro"), a [rapid transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit "Rapid transit") network, is being built in stages. [Line 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCMC_Metro_Line_1 "HCMC Metro Line 1") was opened in late 2024.[^125] The line connects [Bến Thành](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%BFn_Th%C3%A0nh_station "Bến Thành station") to [Suối Tiên Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suoi_Tien_Amusement_Park "Suoi Tien Amusement Park") in [District 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 9, Ho Chi Minh City"), with a depot in Long Bình. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily.[^126] A line between Bến Thành and Tham Lương in [District 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_12,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 12, Ho Chi Minh City") has been approved by the government,[^127] and several more lines (Lines [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCMC_Metro_Line_2 "HCMC Metro Line 2"), 3, 4, 5, and 6) are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.[^126]

#### Bus

Public buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. The city has a number of coach houses, which house [coach buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_bus "Coach bus") to and from other areas in Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh City has five interprovincial coach stations: [Mien Dong Coach Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mien_Dong_Coach_Station "Mien Dong Coach Station") ([Binh Thanh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binh_Thanh "Binh Thanh")), [Mien Tay Coach Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mien_Tay_Coach_Station&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mien Tay Coach Station (page does not exist)") ([Binh Tan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_T%C3%A2n_District,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "Bình Tân District, Ho Chi Minh City")), [An Suong Coach Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An_Suong_Coach_Station&action=edit&redlink=1 "An Suong Coach Station (page does not exist)") ([Hoc Mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoc_Mon "Hoc Mon")), [Nga Tu Ga Coach Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nga_Tu_Ga_Coach_Station&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nga Tu Ga Coach Station (page does not exist)") ([District 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_12_\(Ho_Chi_Minh_city\) "District 12 (Ho Chi Minh city)")), and the former Mien Dong Coach Station. The largest coach station – in terms of passengers handled – is the [Miền Đông Coach Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mien_Dong_Coach_Station "Mien Dong Coach Station") in the [Bình Thạnh District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%ACnh_Th%E1%BA%A1nh_District "Bình Thạnh District").

### Private transport

The main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre.

For short trips, " *xe ôm* " (literally, "hug vehicle") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. You can also book motorcycle and car taxis through ride-hailing apps like [Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_\(company\) "Grab (company)") and [GoJek](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GoJek&action=edit&redlink=1 "GoJek (page does not exist)"). A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on [cyclos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_rickshaw "Cycle rickshaw"), which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular.[^128] There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi.[^122] The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.[^129]

## Healthcare

The health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of international facilities,[^132] as well as privately owned clinics.[^77] The 1,400-bed [Chợ Rẫy Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%A3_R%E1%BA%ABy_Hospital "Chợ Rẫy Hospital"), upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology, Prima Saigon Eye Hospital ([Ophthalmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology "Ophthalmology")), a member of [World Association of Eye Hospitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Association_of_Eye_Hospitals "World Association of Eye Hospitals"),[^133] [City International Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_International_Hospital "City International Hospital") and [Franco-Vietnamese Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Vietnamese_Hospital "Franco-Vietnamese Hospital") are among the top medical facilities in the South-East Asia region, according to Tran Quoc Bao, a prominent Asian Healthcare Leader and Investment Banker, orchestrated 12 major healthcare M&A transactions.[^134]

## Tourism

![[~/×/26aca19bec6deb4fac3fba76ac00b3ab_MD5.jpg]]

Bùi Viện Walking Street is lined with hotels, coffee shops and bars catering to tourists.

Tourist attractions in the city are mainly related to periods of French colonisation and the Vietnam War. The city's centre has some wide American-style boulevards and a few [French colonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial "French colonial") buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the [Reunification Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_Palace "Reunification Palace") (**Dinh Thống Nhất**), City Hall (**Ủy ban nhân dân Thành phố**), [Municipal Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Theatre,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City") (**Nhà hát thành phố**, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (**Bưu điện thành phố**), State Bank Office (**Ngân hàng Nhà nước**), City People's Court (**Tòa án nhân dân thành phố**), and [Notre-Dame Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_Cathedral_Basilica_of_Saigon "Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon") (**Nhà thờ Đức Bà Sài Gòn**), which was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels include the [Hotel Majestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Majestic_\(Saigon\) "Hotel Majestic (Saigon)"), dating from the French colonial era, and the [Rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Hotel "Rex Hotel") and Caravelle hotels, both of which are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.[^142]

The city has various museums including the [City Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "Museum of Ho Chi Minh City"), [Museum of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_Museum_of_History "Ho Chi Minh City Museum of History"), the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the [War Remnants Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Remnants_Museum "War Remnants Museum"), the Museum of Southern Women, the [Museum of Fine Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_Museum_of_Fine_Arts "Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts"), the Nhà Rồng Memorial House, and the Bến Dược Relic of Underground Tunnels. The [Củ Chi tunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_tunnels "Củ Chi tunnels") are north-west of the city in [Củ Chi District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_District "Củ Chi District"). The [Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_Zoo_and_Botanical_Gardens "Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens"), in [District 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_1,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City "District 1, Ho Chi Minh City"), dates from 1865. The Đầm Sen Tourist and Cultural Park, [Suối Tiên Amusement and Culture Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su%E1%BB%91i_Ti%C3%AAn_Amusement_Park "Suối Tiên Amusement Park"), and Cần Giờ's Eco beach resort are three recreational sites inside the city which are popular with tourists. Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the Bến Thành Theatre, Hòa Bình Theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. The city is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60–70% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry. Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of the city keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.

Like many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as [phở](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%E1%BB%9F "Phở") or [rice vermicelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_vermicelli "Rice vermicelli"). Backpacking travellers most often frequent the "Backpackers' Quarter" on [Phạm Ngũ Lão Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph%E1%BA%A1m_Ng%C5%A9_L%C3%A3o_Street "Phạm Ngũ Lão Street") and [Bùi Viện Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B9i_Vi%E1%BB%87n_Street "Bùi Viện Street"), District 1.[^143]

It was approximated that 4.3 million tourists visited Vietnam in 2007, of which 70 percent, approximately 3 million tourists, visited the city.[^144] According to the most recent international tourist statistic, Ho Chi Minh City welcomed 6 million tourists in 2017.[^145]

According to [Mastercard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard "Mastercard") 's 2019 report, the city is also the country's second most visited city (18th in Asia Pacific), with 4.1 million overnight international visitors in 2018 (after [Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi "Hanoi") with 4.8 million visitors).[^146]
