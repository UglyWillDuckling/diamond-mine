**Geodude** ([Japanese](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Japanese_Pok%C3%A9mon_names "List of Japanese Pokémon names"): **イシツブテ** *Isitsubute*) is a dual-type [Rock](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rock_\(type\) "Rock (type)") / [Ground](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ground_\(type\) "Ground (type)") [Pokémon](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_\(species\) "Pokémon (species)") introduced in [Generation I](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_I "Generation I").

It [evolves](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") into [Graveler](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Graveler_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Graveler (Pokémon)") starting at [level](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Level "Level") 25, which evolves into [Golem](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Golem_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Golem (Pokémon)") when [traded](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trade_Evolution "Trade Evolution") or when exposed to a [Linking Cord](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Linking_Cord "Linking Cord").

In [Alola](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alola "Alola"), Geodude has a dual-type [Rock](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rock_\(type\) "Rock (type)") / [Electric](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Electric_\(type\) "Electric (type)") [regional form](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Regional_form "Regional form"). It evolves into [Alolan](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alolan_form "Alolan form") Graveler starting at level 25, which evolves into Alolan Golem when traded. These Geodude can also be found in [Blueberry Academy](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blueberry_Academy "Blueberry Academy") 's [Terarium](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Terarium "Terarium").

(Refer to [Game data→Evolution data](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/#Evolution_data) for more details.)

## Biology

Geodude is a brownish-gray [boulder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boulder "wp:boulder") [Pokémon](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_\(species\) "Pokémon (species)"). It has bulging, rocky eyebrows, trapezoidal eyes with brown pupils, and a wide mouth. Its arms are muscular with five-fingered hands. Geodude uses its arms to climb steadily up steep mountain paths. As a result of their physical appearance, [Rhyperior](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rhyperior_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Rhyperior (Pokémon)") sometimes mistake this Pokémon for actual boulders and fire them through their hands.

Geodude is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. It will even go as far as to compare itself with other species such as [Roggenrola](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Roggenrola_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Roggenrola (Pokémon)") and [Carbink](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Carbink_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Carbink (Pokémon)"). The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Long-lived Geodude are completely smooth and round and they have a calm demeanor. However, Geodude's heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what. Geodude can be most often found on [mountain trails and fields](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_habitat#Mountain_Pok%C3%A9mon "List of Pokémon by habitat"), with a scholar counting about 100 of them on just one route. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs. When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it. In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food.

### Forms

Geodude has a [regional form](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Regional_form "Regional form"): [Alolan](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alolan_form "Alolan form") Geodude.

In the [Alola](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alola "Alola") region, Geodude is made from a magnetic rock with a more silvery appearance. There are areas on Alolan Geodude's body that are especially magnetic and attract iron sand, creating the appearance of black eyebrows and strands of short black hair.<sup><a href="https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Its fingers are fused together, leaving only the thumb and index finger free.

Stepping on Alolan Geodude results in an electrical shock and sometimes an angry headbutt. Like regular Geodude, it competes with others by bashing their bodies together. The iron sand sticks to the one with stronger magnetism. The Alolan [Golem](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Golem_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Golem (Pokémon)") will fire these Geodude from its back if real rocks are absent. They can also be found in the [Canyon Biome](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Canyon_Biome "Canyon Biome") of [Blueberry Academy](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blueberry_Academy "Blueberry Academy") 's [Terarium](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Terarium "Terarium"), where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Geodude and its evolved forms are the [only known Pokémon](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Signature_Ability "Signature Ability") that can have [Galvanize](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Galvanize_\(Ability\) "Galvanize (Ability)") as an [Ability](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability "Ability").

### Evolution

Geodude evolves into [Graveler](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Graveler_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Graveler (Pokémon)"), which evolves into [Golem](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Golem_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\) "Golem (Pokémon)").

[Alolan](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alolan_form "Alolan form") Geodude has a dual-type [Rock](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rock_\(type\) "Rock (type)") / [Electric](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Electric_\(type\) "Electric (type)") [regional form](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Regional_form "Regional form"). It evolves into Alolan Graveler, which evolves into Alolan Golem.
