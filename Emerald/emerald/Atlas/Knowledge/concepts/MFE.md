 Micro Frontend Engineering: MFE is an architectural approach to building modern web applications, where a single application is divided into multiple, **independent frontends**, each responsible for a specific feature or functionality.
  
  raEach micro frontend is developed, deployed, and maintained independently, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.
