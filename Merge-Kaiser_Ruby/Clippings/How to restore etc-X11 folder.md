Accidentally, I removed the entire `X11` folder while setting up my Wayland configuration, which is why Sway won't start.

How can I restore the folder?

P.S.: `pacman -R xorg && pacman -Sy xorg` doesn't work

As i wrote in the comments, try to reinstall `xorg-xinit`.

Try:

```
sudo pacman -S --needed --overwrite="*" xorg-server xorg-xinit
```

or  
`xorg` and other **related xorg packages**.

```
sudo pacman -S xorg-xinit xorg-server xorg-xrdb xorg-xrandr xorg-xauth xorg-xsetroot
```

*What @Ljm Dullaart wrote in the answer:*

If reinstall not work try to copy with `rsync` or `cp` all files and folders from a new installation.

Without backup there is no restore. Sorry.

The best you can do is to try to copy the files from a fresh install (install the same distribution on a USB stick and copy from that USB stick) or try to re-install the X11 packages.
