**Eourope** is a [continent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cnote_t">[t]</a></sup> located entirely in the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere") and mostly in the [Eastern Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Hemisphere "Eastern Hemisphere"). It is bordered by the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean") to the north, the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") to the west, the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") to the south, and [Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia") to the east. Europe shares the [landmass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmass "Landmass") of [Eurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") with Asia, and of [Afro-Eurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Eurasia "Afro-Eurasia") with both [Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") and Asia.[^31] [^32] Europe is commonly considered to be [separated from Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundaries_between_the_continents#Asia_and_Europe "Boundaries between the continents") by the [watershed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide "Drainage divide") of the [Ural Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains"), the [Ural River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_\(river\) "Ural (river)"), the [Caspian Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea"), the [Greater Caucasus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Caucasus "Greater Caucasus"), the [Black Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "Black Sea"), and the waterway of the [Bosporus Strait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporus "Bosporus").[^33]

Europe covers approx. 10,186,000 square kilometres (3,933,000 sq mi), or 2% of [Earth's surface](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Surface "Earth") (6.8% of Earth's land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the [seven-continent model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent#Number "Continent")). [Politically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Europe "Politics of Europe"), Europe is divided into about [fifty sovereign states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_in_Europe#UN_member_states_and_UNGA_non-member_observer_state "List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe"), of which [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") is the [largest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_area "List of European countries by area") and [most populous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population "List of European countries by population"), spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of [its population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Europe "Demographics of Europe"). Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the [world population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population "World population")) in 2021; the [third-largest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_continents_and_continental_subregions_by_population "List of continents and continental subregions by population") after Asia and Africa.[^23] [^24] The [European climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Europe "Climate of Europe") is affected by warm Atlantic currents, such as the [Gulf Stream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream"), which produce a [temperate climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate "Temperate climate"), tempering winters and summers, on much of the continent. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable producing more [continental climates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate "Continental climate").

The [culture of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Europe "Culture of Europe") consists of a range of national and regional cultures, which form the central roots of the wider [Western civilisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture"), and together commonly reference [ancient Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and [ancient Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"), particularly through [their Christian successors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Europe "Christianity in Europe"), as crucial and shared roots.[^34] [^35] Beginning with the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire") in 476 CE, [Christian consolidation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization "Christianization") of Europe in the wake of the [Migration Period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period "Migration Period") marked the European [post-classical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-classical "Post-classical") [Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). The [Italian Renaissance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance") spread across many [Western European](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") countries, adapting to local contexts and giving rise to distinct national expressions. The renewed [humanist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism") emphasis on [art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art "Renaissance art") and [science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Renaissance "Science in the Renaissance") was among the several factors that contributed to the broader transition to the modern era. Since the [Age of Discovery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery "Age of Discovery"), led by [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") and [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire"), Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, [European powers colonised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_European_colonies "List of former European colonies") at various times the [Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), almost all of Africa and [Oceania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania "Oceania"), and the majority of Asia.

The [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), the [French Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), and the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") shaped the continent culturally, politically, and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), which began in [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain") at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in [Western Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") and eventually the wider world. Both [world wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war "World war") began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and the United States took prominence and competed over [ideological dominance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_dominance "Ideological dominance") and [international influence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_influence "International influence") in Europe and globally.[^36] The resulting [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") divided Europe along the [Iron Curtain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain "Iron Curtain"), with [NATO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") in the [West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc "Western Bloc") and the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact") in the [East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc"). This divide ended with the [Revolutions of 1989](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989"), the [fall of the Berlin Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall "Fall of the Berlin Wall"), and the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"), which allowed [European integration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration "European integration") to advance significantly.

European integration has been advanced institutionally since 1948 with the founding of the [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe"), and significantly through the realisation of the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") (EU), which represents today the majority of Europe.[^37] The European Union is a [supranational](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union "Supranational union") political entity that lies between a [confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation "Confederation") and a [federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation "Federation") and is based on a system of [European treaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_treaties "European treaties").[^38] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [expanding eastward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union "Enlargement of the European Union") since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the [euro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro"), and participate in the [European single market](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_single_market "European single market") and [a customs union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union "European Union Customs Union"). A large bloc of countries, the [Schengen Area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area "Schengen Area"), have also abolished internal border and immigration controls. [Regular popular elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament "Elections to the European Parliament") take place every five years within the EU; they are considered to be the second-largest democratic elections in the world after [India's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_India "Elections in India"). The [EU economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union "Economy of the European Union") is the second-largest in the world by nominal GDP and third-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.

## Etymology

Reconstruction of an early [world map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_world_maps "Early world maps") made by [Anaximander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") of the 6th century BCE, dividing the known world into three large landmasses, one of which was named Europe

The place name Evros was first used by the ancient Greeks to refer to their northernmost province, which bears the same name today. The principal river there – Evros (today's [Maritsa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritsa "Maritsa")) – flows through the fertile valleys of [Thrace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace "Thrace"),[^39] which itself was also called Europe, before the term meant the continent.[^40]

In classical [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), [Europa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_\(consort_of_Zeus\) "Europa (consort of Zeus)") ([Ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Εὐρώπη, *Eurṓpē*) was a [Phoenician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia "Phoenicia") princess. One view is that her name derives from the Ancient Greek elements εὐρύς (*eurús*) 'wide, broad', and ὤψ (*ōps*, [gen.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case")ὠπός, *ōpós*) 'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite *Eurṓpē* would mean 'wide-gazing' or 'broad of aspect'.[^41] [^42] [^43] [^44] *Broad* has been an [epithet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet "Epithet") of Earth herself in the reconstructed [Proto-Indo-European religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_mythology "Proto-Indo-European mythology") and the poetry devoted to it.[^41] An alternative view is that of [Robert Beekes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._P._Beekes "Robert S. P. Beekes"), who has argued in favour of a pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from *eurus* would yield a different [toponym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponymy "Toponymy") than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and localities such as that of [Europos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europus_\(Almopia\) "Europus (Almopia)") in [ancient Macedonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(ancient_kingdom\) "Macedonia (ancient kingdom)").[^45]

There have been attempts to connect *Eurṓpē* to a Semitic term for *west*, this being either [Akkadian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language "Akkadian language") *erebu* meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or [Phoenician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_language "Phoenician language") *'ereb* 'evening, west',[^44] which is at the origin of [Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") *maghreb* and [Hebrew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") *ma'arav*. [Martin Litchfield West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Litchfield_West "Martin Litchfield West") stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor",[^46] while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable.[^45]

Most major world languages use words derived from *Eurṓpē* or *Europa* to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word *Ōuzhōu* (歐洲 / 欧洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name *Ōuluóbā zhōu* (歐羅巴洲) (*zhōu* means "continent"); a similar Chinese-derived term *Ōshū* (欧州) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, *Ōshū Rengō* (欧州連合), despite the [katakana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") *Yōroppa* (ヨーロッパ) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name *[Frangistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frangistan "Frangistan")* ("land of the [Franks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks "Franks") ") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as *Avrupa* or *Evropa*.[^47]

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century. Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the east and north-east are usually taken to be the [Ural Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains"), the [Ural River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_\(river\) "Ural (river)"), and the [Caspian Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea"); to the south-east, the [Caucasus Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Mountains "Caucasus Mountains"), the [Black Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "Black Sea"), and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea").[^48]

Definitions used for the boundary between Asia and Europe in different periods of history.

A medieval [T and O map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_and_O_map "T and O map") printed by [Günther Zainer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Zainer "Günther Zainer") in 1472, showing the three continents as domains of the sons of [Noah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah "Noah") – Asia to Sem ([Shem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem "Shem")), Europe to Iafeth ([Japheth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japheth "Japheth")) and Africa to Cham ([Ham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_\(son_of_Noah\) "Ham (son of Noah)"))

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [Iceland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland") is considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to [North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"), although politically belonging to Denmark. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to [Anatolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") (or Asia Minor), but is considered part of Europe politically [^49] and it is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of [North-western Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb "Maghreb") for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.[^50] "Europe", as used specifically in [British English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English"), may also refer to [Continental Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe "Continental Europe") exclusively.[^51]

The term "continent" usually implies the [physical geography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography "Physical geography") of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in [classical antiquity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges. Cartographer [Herman Moll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Moll "Herman Moll") suggested in 1715 Europe was bounded by a series of partly-joined waterways directed towards the Turkish straits, and the [Irtysh River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irtysh_River "Irtysh River") draining into the upper part of the [Ob River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ob_River "Ob River") and the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean"). In contrast, the present eastern boundary of Europe partially adheres to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clear-cut definition of the term "continent".

The current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects [East-West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_dichotomy "East–West dichotomy") cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a [transcontinental country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transcontinental_countries "List of transcontinental countries") divided entirely by water, while Russia and [Kazakhstan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan") are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other [continents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continents "Continents") separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") —namely, [Ceuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta "Ceuta") and [Melilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla "Melilla") —which are parts of [Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.

The first recorded usage of *Eurṓpē* as a geographic term is in the [Homeric Hymn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Hymn "Homeric Hymn") to [Delian Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_Apollo "Delian Apollo"), in reference to the western shore of the [Aegean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea "Aegean Sea"). As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BCE by [Anaximander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") and [Hecataeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Miletus "Hecataeus of Miletus"). Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern [Rioni River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rioni_River "Rioni River") on the territory of [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)")) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by [Herodotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus") in the 5th century BCE.[^52] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts—Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa)—with the [Nile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile") and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the [River Don](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_River_\(Russia\) "Don River (Russia)"), rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[^53] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer [Strabo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo") at the River Don.[^54] The *[Book of Jubilees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilees "Jubilees")* described the continents as the lands given by [Noah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah "Noah") to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the [Pillars of Hercules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules "Pillars of Hercules") at the [Strait of Gibraltar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar "Strait of Gibraltar"), separating it from [Northwest Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Africa "Northwest Africa"), to the Don, separating it from Asia.[^55]

The convention received by the [Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") and surviving into modern usage is that of the [Roman era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_era "Roman era") used by Roman-era authors such as [Posidonius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius "Posidonius"),[^56] [Strabo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo"),[^57] and [Ptolemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"),[^58] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.

The Roman Empire did not attach a strong identity to the concept of continental divisions. However, following the fall of the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire"), the [culture that developed in its place](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture"), linked to Latin and the Catholic church, began to associate itself with the concept of "Europe".[^59] The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance") of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [Western Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Church "Western Church"), as opposed to both the [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") churches and to the [Islamic world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_world "Islamic world").

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [Latin Christendom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom "Christendom") coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [Byzantium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium "Byzantium") and [Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam"), and limited to northern [Iberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia "Iberia"), the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[^60] [^61] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance"): *Europa* often figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, [Alcuin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin "Alcuin").[^62] The transition of Europe to being a cultural term as well as a geographic one led to the borders of Europe being affected by cultural considerations in the East, especially relating to areas under Byzantine, Ottoman, and Russian influence. Such questions were affected by the positive connotations associated with the term Europe by its users. Such cultural considerations were not applied to the Americas, despite their conquest and settlement by European states. Instead, the concept of "Western civilisation" emerged as a way of grouping together Europe and these colonies.[^63]

#### Modern definitions

*A New Map of Europe According to the Newest Observations* (1721) by Hermann Moll draws the eastern boundary of Europe along the Don River flowing south-west and the Tobol, Irtysh and Ob rivers flowing north.

1916 political map of Europe showing most of Moll's waterways replaced by von Strahlenberg's Ural Mountains and Freshfield's Caucasus crest, land features of a type that normally defines a subcontinent

The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of [Muscovy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia "Tsardom of Russia") began to include [North Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia "North Asia"). Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [Eurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [Turkish Straits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Straits "Turkish Straits"), the [Black Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "Black Sea"), the [Kerch Strait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerch_Strait "Kerch Strait"), the [Sea of Azov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Azov "Sea of Azov") and the [Don](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_River_\(Russia\) "Don River (Russia)") (ancient [Tanais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanais "Tanais")). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [Kalach-na-Donu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalach-na-Donu "Kalach-na-Donu") (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [Volga–Don Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga%E2%80%93Don_Canal "Volga–Don Canal")), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

Around 1715, [Herman Moll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Moll "Herman Moll") produced a map showing the northern part of the [Ob River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ob_River "Ob River") and the [Irtysh River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irtysh_River "Irtysh River"), a major tributary of the Ob, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between Europe and Asia.

Four years later, in 1725, [Philip Johan von Strahlenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Johan_von_Strahlenberg "Philip Johan von Strahlenberg") was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary. He drew a new line along the [Volga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_River "Volga River"), following the Volga north until the [Samara Bend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_Bend "Samara Bend"), along [Obshchy Syrt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obshchy_Syrt "Obshchy Syrt") (the [drainage divide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide "Drainage divide") between the Volga and [Ural Rivers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_River "Ural River")), then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the [Ural Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains"). At this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways. Accordingly, he drew the new boundary north along [Ural Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains") rather than the nearby and parallel running Ob and Irtysh rivers.[^64] This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted. However, this did not come without criticism. [Voltaire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire "Voltaire"), writing in 1760 about [Peter the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great") 's efforts to make Russia more European, ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither Russia, Scandinavia, northern Germany, nor Poland were fully part of Europe.[^59] Since then, many modern analytical geographers like [Halford Mackinder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halford_Mackinder "Halford Mackinder") have declared that they see little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.[^65]

The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [1745 atlas](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Atlas_of_Russian_Empire._1745_year "commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year") published by the [Russian Academy of Sciences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences "Russian Academy of Sciences") has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [Serafimovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serafimovich_\(town\) "Serafimovich (town)") before cutting north towards [Arkhangelsk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkhangelsk "Arkhangelsk"), while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [John Cary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cary "John Cary") followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [Kuma–Manych Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma%E2%80%93Manych_Depression "Kuma–Manych Depression") was identified c. 1773 by a German naturalist, [Peter Simon Pallas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Simon_Pallas "Peter Simon Pallas"), as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[^66] [^67] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [Volga–Don Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga%E2%80%93Don_Canal "Volga–Don Canal") and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [Greater Caucasus watershed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Caucasus_watershed "Greater Caucasus watershed") to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [Douglas Freshfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Freshfield "Douglas Freshfield") advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".[^68]

In Russia and the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[^69] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [Baydaratskaya Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baydaratskaya_Bay "Baydaratskaya Bay"), on the [Kara Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Sea "Kara Sea"), along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [Ural River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_River "Ural River") until the [Mugodzhar Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugodzhar_Hills "Mugodzhar Hills"), and then the [Emba River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emba_River "Emba River"); and Kuma–Manych Depression,[^70] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[^71] The *[Flora Europaea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Europaea "Flora Europaea")* adopted a boundary along the [Terek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terek_\(river\) "Terek (river)") and [Kuban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuban_\(river\) "Kuban (river)") rivers, so southwards from the Kuma and the Manych, but still with the Caucasus entirely in Asia.[^72] [^73] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest,[^74] and this became the common convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.

Some view the separation of [Eurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") into Asia and Europe as a residue of [Eurocentrism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocentrism "Eurocentrism"): "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. \[...\]." [^75]

### Prehistory

[Last Glacial Maximum refugia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum_refugia "Last Glacial Maximum refugia"), c. 20,000 years ago  

[Solutrean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutrean "Solutrean") culture

Paleolithic cave paintings from [Lascaux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux "Lascaux") in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") (c. 15,000 BCE)

[Stonehenge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge "Stonehenge") in the United Kingdom (Late Neolithic from 3000 to 2000 BCE)

During the 2.5 million years of the [Pleistocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene"), numerous cold phases called [glacials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_period "Glacial period") ([Quaternary ice age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation")), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter [interglacials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial "Interglacial") which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the [last glacial period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period "Last glacial period") ended about 10,000 years ago.[^77] Earth is currently in an interglacial period of the Quaternary, called the [Holocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene").[^78]

*[Homo erectus georgicus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus_georgicus "Homo erectus georgicus")*, which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)"), is the earliest [hominin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini "Hominini") to have been discovered in Europe.[^79] [Other](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_antecessor "Homo antecessor") hominin remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in [Atapuerca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_Site_of_Atapuerca "Archaeological Site of Atapuerca"), [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain").[^80] [Neanderthal man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_man "Neanderthal man") (named after the [Neandertal valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neandertal_\(valley\) "Neandertal (valley)") in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany")) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago (115,000 years ago it is found already in the territory of present-day [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland") [^81]) and disappeared from the fossil record about 40,000 years ago,[^82] with their final refuge being the Iberian Peninsula. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans ([Cro-Magnons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Magnons "Cro-Magnons")), who seem to have appeared in Europe around 43,000 to 40,000 years ago.[^83] However, there is also evidence that Homo sapiens arrived in Europe around 54,000 years ago, some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.[^84] The earliest sites in Europe dated 48,000 years ago are [Riparo Mochi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparo_Mochi "Riparo Mochi") (Italy), [Geissenklösterle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geissenkl%C3%B6sterle "Geissenklösterle") (Germany) and [Isturitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isturitz "Isturitz") (France).[^85] [^86]

The [European Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Neolithic "European Neolithic") period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BCE in [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece") and the [Balkans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans "Balkans"), probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [Anatolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") and the [Near East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East "Near East").[^87] It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [Danube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube "Danube") and the [Rhine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine "Rhine") ([Linear Pottery culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Pottery_culture "Linear Pottery culture")), and along the [Mediterranean coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_coast "Mediterranean coast") ([Cardial culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardial_Ware "Cardial Ware")). Between 4500 and 3000 BCE, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as [causewayed enclosures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causewayed_enclosure "Causewayed enclosure"), [burial mounds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_mound "Burial mound") and [megalithic tombs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_tomb "Megalithic tomb").[^88] The [Corded Ware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corded_Ware "Corded Ware") cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the [Chalcolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic "Chalcolithic"). During this period giant [megalithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic "Megalithic") monuments, such as the [Megalithic Temples of Malta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_Temples_of_Malta "Megalithic Temples of Malta") and [Stonehenge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge "Stonehenge"), were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.[^89] [^90]

The modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages:[^91] Mesolithic [hunter-gatherers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer"), descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic [Epigravettian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigravettian "Epigravettian") culture;[^76] Neolithic [Early European Farmers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_European_Farmers "Early European Farmers") who migrated from Anatolia during the [Neolithic Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution "Neolithic Revolution") 9,000 years ago;[^92] and [Yamnaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamnaya_culture "Yamnaya culture") [Steppe herders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Steppe_Herders "Western Steppe Herders") who expanded into Europe from the [Pontic–Caspian steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic%E2%80%93Caspian_steppe "Pontic–Caspian steppe") of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of [Indo-European migrations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_migrations "Indo-European migrations") 5,000 years ago.[^91] [^93] The [European Bronze Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bronze_Age "European Bronze Age") began c. 3200 BCE in Greece with the [Minoan civilisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization "Minoan civilization") on [Crete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete "Crete"), the first advanced civilisation in Europe.[^94] The Minoans were followed by the [Myceneans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenean_Greece "Mycenean Greece"), who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BCE, ushering the [European Iron Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Iron_Age "European Iron Age").[^95] Iron Age colonisation by the [Greeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks "Greeks") and [Phoenicians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicians "Phoenicians") gave rise to early [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_basin "Mediterranean basin") cities. Early [Iron Age Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_Italy "Iron Age Italy") and [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greece "Archaic Greece") from around the 8th century BCE gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BCE, the year of the first [Olympic Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games "Ancient Olympic Games").[^96]

### Classical antiquity

The [Parthenon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon "Parthenon") in [Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") (432 BCE)

Ancient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western [democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy") and [rationalist culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[^97] The Greek city-state, the [polis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis "Polis"), was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[^97] In 508 BCE, [Cleisthenes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleisthenes "Cleisthenes") instituted the world's first [democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy "Athenian democracy") system of government in [Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens").[^98] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [humanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism "Humanism") and [rationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") under [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), [Socrates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") and [Plato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"); in [history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography "Historiography") with [Herodotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus") and [Thucydides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides "Thucydides"); in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of [Homer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer");[^99] in drama with [Sophocles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles "Sophocles") and [Euripides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides "Euripides"); in medicine with [Hippocrates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates "Hippocrates") and [Galen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen"); and in science with [Pythagoras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras "Pythagoras"), [Euclid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"), and [Archimedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes").[^100] [^101] [^102] In the course of the 5th century BCE, several of the Greek [city states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_states "City states") would ultimately check the [Achaemenid Persian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire "Achaemenid Empire") advance in Europe through the [Greco-Persian Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars "Greco-Persian Wars"), considered a pivotal moment in world history,[^103] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as [Golden Age of Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-century_Athens "Fifth-century Athens"), the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilisation.

Greece was followed by [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"), which left its mark on [law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law "Roman law"), [politics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics"), [language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), [engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_engineering "Roman engineering"), [architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_architecture "Roman architecture"), [government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_government "Centralized government"), and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[^97] By 200 BCE, Rome had conquered [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Italy "Roman Italy") and over the following two centuries it conquered [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), [Hispania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispania "Hispania") ([Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") and [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal")), the [North African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa") coast, much of the [Middle East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"), [Gaul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul "Gaul") ([France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") and [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium")), and [Britannia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain "Roman Britain") (England and [Wales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales")).

Expanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the third century BCE, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The [Roman Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") ended in 27 BCE, when [Augustus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus") proclaimed the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"). The two centuries that followed are known as the *[pax romana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_romana "Pax romana")*, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and political stability in most of Europe.[^104] The empire continued to expand under emperors such as [Antoninus Pius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius "Antoninus Pius") and [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius "Marcus Aurelius"), who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting [Germanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples "Germanic peoples"), [Pictish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts "Picts") and [Scottish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people "Scottish people") tribes.[^105] [^106] [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") was [legalised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great_and_Christianity "Constantine the Great and Christianity") by [Constantine I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I "Constantine I") in 313 CE after three centuries of [imperial persecution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_early_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire "Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire"). Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of [Byzantium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium "Byzantium") (modern-day [Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul")) which was renamed [Constantinople](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople") in his honour in 330 CE. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE, and in 391–392 CE the emperor [Theodosius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I "Theodosius I") outlawed pagan religions.[^107] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire") in 476 CE; the closure of the pagan [Platonic Academy of Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy "Platonic Academy") in 529 CE;[^108] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century CE. During most of its existence, the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.[^109]

Europe c. 650

[Charlemagne's empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire "Carolingian Empire") in 814: Francia, Tributaries

During the [decline of the Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire "Decline of the Roman Empire"), Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the " [Age of Migrations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Migrations "Age of Migrations") ". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [Ostrogoths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths "Ostrogoths"), [Visigoths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths "Visigoths"), [Goths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths "Goths"), [Vandals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals "Vandals"), [Huns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns "Huns"), [Franks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks "Franks"), [Angles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles_\(tribe\) "Angles (tribe)"), [Saxons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons "Saxons"), [Slavs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs "Slavs"), [Avars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Avars "Pannonian Avars"), [Bulgars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars "Bulgars"), [Vikings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings "Vikings"), [Pechenegs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pechenegs "Pechenegs"), [Cumans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumans "Cumans"), and [Magyars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyars "Magyars").[^104] [Renaissance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") thinkers such as [Petrarch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch") would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".[^110]

Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this, very few written records survive. Much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe, though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[^111]

While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire"), also known as the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"). During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor [Justinian I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I "Justinian I") presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [legal code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Justinian "Code of Justinian") that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [Hagia Sophia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia "Hagia Sophia") and brought the Christian church under state control.[^112]

From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring [Sasanid Persians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanids "Sasanids") were severely weakened due to the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [Byzantine–Sasanian wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_wars "Byzantine–Sasanian wars"), the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into [Asia Minor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor "Asia Minor"). In the mid-7th century, following the [Muslim conquest of Persia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Persia "Muslim conquest of Persia"), Islam penetrated into the [Caucasus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus "Caucasus") region.[^113] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took [Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_in_the_Middle_Ages "Cyprus in the Middle Ages"), [Malta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta "Malta"), [Crete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Crete "Emirate of Crete"), [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Sicily "Emirate of Sicily"), and [parts of southern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Islam_in_southern_Italy "History of Islam in southern Italy").[^114] Between 711 and 720, most of the lands of the [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_Kingdom "Visigothic Kingdom") of [Iberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula") were brought under [Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") rule—save for small areas in the northwest ([Asturias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias "Asturias")) and largely [Basque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_people "Basque people") regions in the [Pyrenees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees"). This territory, under the Arabic name [Al-Andalus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"), became part of the expanding [Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate"). The unsuccessful [second siege of Constantinople](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_\(717%E2%80%93718\) "Siege of Constantinople (717–718)") (717) weakened the [Umayyad dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad "Umayyad") and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [Frankish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia "Francia") leader [Charles Martel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martel "Charles Martel") at the [Battle of Poitiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tours "Battle of Tours") in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle [Pyrenees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees") the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of [Asturias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Asturias "Kingdom of Asturias"), [Leon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Leon "Kingdom of Leon"), and [Galicia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Galicia "Kingdom of Galicia") were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the [Moors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors "Moors") out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focused on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the [Reconquista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista "Reconquista") took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordoños, Ramiros, Fernandos, and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.

[Viking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking "Viking") raids and division of the Frankish Empire at the [Treaty of Verdun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun "Treaty of Verdun") in 843

During the Dark Ages, the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire") fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.[^115] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [Clovis I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_I "Clovis I").[^116] [Charlemagne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne"), a Frankish king of the [Carolingian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian "Carolingian") dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed " [Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor "Holy Roman Emperor") " by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"), which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[^117]

[East Central Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Central_Europe "East Central Europe") saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") (c. 1000 CE). The powerful [West Slavic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Slavs "West Slavs") state of [Great Moravia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moravia "Great Moravia") spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under [Svatopluk I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svatopluk_I_of_Moravia "Svatopluk I of Moravia") and causing a series of armed conflicts with [East Francia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Francia "East Francia"). Further south, the first [South Slavic states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Slavs "South Slavs") emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"): the [First Bulgarian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire "First Bulgarian Empire"), the [Serbian Principality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Serbia_\(early_medieval\) "Principality of Serbia (early medieval)") (later [Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia_\(medieval\) "Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)") and [Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Empire "Serbian Empire")), and the [Duchy of Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Croatia "Duchy of Croatia") (later [Kingdom of Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Croatia_\(925%E2%80%931102\) "Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)")). To the east, [Kievan Rus'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27 "Kievan Rus'") expanded from its capital in [Kiev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev "Kiev") to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [Vladimir the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_the_Great "Vladimir the Great") adopted [Orthodox Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church "Russian Orthodox Church") as the religion of state.[^118] [^119] Further east, [Volga Bulgaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Bulgaria "Volga Bulgaria") became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[^120]

The [maritime republics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_republics "Maritime republics") of medieval [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") reestablished contacts between Europe, Asia and Africa with extensive trade networks and colonies across the Mediterranean, and had an essential role in the [Crusades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades "Crusades").[^121] [^122]

The period between the year 1000 and 1250 is known as the [High Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages"), followed by the [Late Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages") until c. 1500.

During the High Middle Ages the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the [Renaissance of the 12th century](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_of_the_12th_century "Renaissance of the 12th century"). Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") and [Baltic Seas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea"). The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [Maritime Republics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Republics "Maritime Republics") a leading role in the European scene.

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [Feudalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism") developed in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") in the Early Middle Ages, and soon spread throughout Europe.[^123] A struggle for influence between the [nobility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility") and the [monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy") in England led to the writing of [Magna Carta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta "Magna Carta") and the establishment of a [parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament "Parliament").[^124] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"). Through monasteries and [cathedral schools](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_school "Cathedral school"), the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[^123]

[Tancred of Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancred_of_Sicily "Tancred of Sicily") and [Philip II of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France "Philip II of France"), during the [Third Crusade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade "Third Crusade") (1189–1192)

The [Papacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papacy "Papacy") reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [East-West Schism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-West_Schism "East-West Schism") in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") in the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [Pope Urban II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_II "Pope Urban II") called for a [crusade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades "Crusades") against [Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") occupying [Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") and the [Holy Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land "Holy Land").[^125] In Europe itself, the Church organised the [Inquisition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition "Inquisition") against heretics. In the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula"), the [Reconquista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista "Reconquista") concluded with the [fall of Granada in 1492](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_War#Last_stand_at_Granada "Granada War"), ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.[^126]

In the east, a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims, and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[^127] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at [Manzikert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert "Battle of Manzikert"), and was weakened considerably by the [sack of Constantinople in 1204](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_\(1204\) "Siege of Constantinople (1204)"), during the [Fourth Crusade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade "Fourth Crusade").[^128] [^129] [^130] [^131] [^132] [^133] [^134] [^135] [^136] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, [Byzantium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") [fell in 1453](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople "Fall of Constantinople") when [Constantinople was taken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople "Fall of Constantinople") by the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire").[^137] [^138] [^139]

The sacking of [Suzdal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzdal "Suzdal") by [Batu Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Khan "Batu Khan") in 1238, during the [Mongol invasion of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe "Mongol invasion of Europe") (1220s–1240s)

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic [Turkic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples "Turkic peoples") tribes, such as the [Pechenegs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pechenegs "Pechenegs") and the [Cuman-Kipchaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuman-Kipchak_Confederation "Cuman-Kipchak Confederation"), caused a massive migration of [Slavic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peoples "Slavic peoples") populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[^140] Like many other parts of [Eurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia"), these territories were [overrun by the Mongols](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Rus "Mongol invasion of Rus").[^141] The invaders, who became known as [Tatars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars "Tatars"), were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the [Golden Horde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde "Golden Horde") with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion, and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[^142] [^143] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: [Moldavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavia "Moldavia") and [Walachia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walachia "Walachia"). Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[^144] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the [Grand Duchy of Moscow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow "Grand Duchy of Moscow") grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480, and eventually becoming the [Tsardom of Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia "Tsardom of Russia"). The state was consolidated under [Ivan III the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_III_the_Great "Ivan III the Great") and [Ivan the Terrible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible "Ivan the Terrible"), steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.

The [Great Famine of 1315–1317](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315%E2%80%931317 "Great Famine of 1315–1317") was the first [crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Late_Middle_Ages "Crisis of the Late Middle Ages") that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[^145] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_Middle_Ages "France in the Middle Ages") was reduced by half.[^146] [^147] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[^148] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[^149] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the [Black Death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death"), one of the most deadly [pandemics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic "Pandemic") in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the [European population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_demography "Medieval demography") at the time.[^150]

The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by [Giovanni Boccaccio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Boccaccio "Giovanni Boccaccio") in *[The Decameron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decameron "The Decameron")* (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased [persecution of Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews "Persecution of Jews"), [beggars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggars "Beggars") and [lepers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leper "Leper").[^151] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying [virulence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence "Virulence") and mortalities until the 18th century.[^152] During this period, more than 100 plague [epidemics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics "List of epidemics") swept across Europe.[^153]

*[The School of Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens "The School of Athens")* (1511) by [Raphael](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael "Raphael"): Contemporaries of the artist, including [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") and [Michelangelo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo"), are represented in classical guise in this work emblematic of [Renaissance humanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism").

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in [Florence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a [new humanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism") was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten [classical Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece "Classical Greece") and Arabic knowledge from [monastic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic "Monastic") libraries, often translated from Arabic into [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language").[^154] [^155] [^156] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of [art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art "Renaissance art"), [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music"), and [the sciences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance"), under the joint patronage of [royalty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family "Royal family"), the nobility, the [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") and an emerging merchant class.[^157] [^158] [^159] Patrons in Italy, including the [Medici](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medici "Medici") family of Florentine bankers and the [popes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope") in [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome"), funded prolific [quattrocento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quattrocento "Quattrocento") and [cinquecento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinquecento "Cinquecento") artists such as [Raphael](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael "Raphael"), [Michelangelo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo") and [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci").[^160] [^161]

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [Western Schism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism "Western Schism"). During this 40-year period, two popes—one in [Avignon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon "Avignon") and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.[^162] In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[^163] [^164] Exploration reached the [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere") in the Atlantic and the southern tip of Africa. [Christopher Columbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") reached the [New World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World") in 1492, and [Vasco da Gama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama "Vasco da Gama") opened the ocean route to the East, linking the Atlantic and [Indian Oceans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") in 1498. The Portuguese-born explorer [Ferdinand Magellan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan "Ferdinand Magellan") reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the [Pacific Oceans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") in a Spanish expedition, resulting in the first [circumnavigation of the globe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Magellan%27s_circumnavigation "Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation"), completed by the Spaniard [Juan Sebastián Elcano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano "Juan Sebastián Elcano") (1519–1522). Soon after, the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the [Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), Asia, Africa and Oceania.[^165] France, the [Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas and Asia. In 1588, the [Spanish Armada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Armada "Spanish Armada") failed to invade England. A year later, [England tried unsuccessfully to invade Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Armada "English Armada"), allowing [Philip II of Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain "Philip II of Spain") to maintain his dominant war capacity in Europe. This English disaster also allowed the Spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades. However, two more Spanish armadas failed to invade England ([2nd Spanish Armada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Spanish_Armada "2nd Spanish Armada") and [3rd Spanish Armada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Spanish_Armada "3rd Spanish Armada")).[^166] [^167] [^168] [^169]

The principal military base of Philip II in Europe was the Spanish road stretching from the Netherlands to the [Duchy of Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan "Duchy of Milan").[^170]

The Church's power was further weakened by the [Reformation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation"), which began in 1517 when German theologian [Martin Luther](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") nailed his *[Ninety-five Theses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses "Ninety-five Theses")* criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull *[Exsurge Domine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exsurge_Domine "Exsurge Domine")* in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521 [Diet of Worms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_of_Worms "Diet of Worms"), which divided German princes between [Protestant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") and Catholic faiths.[^171] [Religious fighting and warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion "European wars of religion") spread with Protestantism.[^172] The plunder of the empires of the Americas allowed Spain to finance [religious persecution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition "Spanish Inquisition") in Europe for over a century.[^173] The [Thirty Years' War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War "Thirty Years' War") (1618–1648) crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[^174] In the aftermath of the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia"), France rose to predominance within Europe.[^175] The defeat of the [Ottoman Turks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") at the [Battle of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna "Battle of Vienna") in 1683 marked the historic end of [Ottoman expansion into Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe "Ottoman wars in Europe").[^176]

In much of Central and Eastern Europe, the 17th century was [a period of general decline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Crisis "The General Crisis");[^177] the region experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[^178] From the [Union of Krewo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Krewo "Union of Krewo") (1385) east-central Europe was dominated by the [Kingdom of Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_\(1385%E2%80%931569\) "Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)") and the [Grand Duchy of Lithuania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania "Grand Duchy of Lithuania"). The hegemony of the vast [Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth "Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth") had ended with the devastation brought by the [Northern War of 1655–1660](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_War_of_1655%E2%80%931660 "Northern War of 1655–1660") ([Deluge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Deluge "Swedish Deluge")) and subsequent conflicts;[^179] the state itself was [partitioned](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland "Partitions of Poland") and ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century.[^180]

From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the [Golden Horde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde "Golden Horde") were conquered by Russia, [Tatars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars "Crimean Tatars") from the [Crimean Khanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Khanate "Crimean Khanate") frequently [raided](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean-Nogai_raids_into_East_Slavic_lands "Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands") Eastern Slavic lands to [capture slaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "Slavery in the Ottoman Empire").[^181] Further east, the [Nogai Horde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nogai_Horde "Nogai Horde") and [Kazakh Khanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Khanate "Kazakh Khanate") frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of contemporary Russia and Ukraine for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).

The Renaissance and the [New Monarchs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Monarchs "New Monarchs") marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention and scientific development.[^182] Important figures of the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") during the 16th and 17th centuries included [Copernicus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus"), [Kepler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler "Kepler"), [Galileo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo"), and [Isaac Newton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton").[^183] According to Peter Barrett, "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world." [^154]

The national boundaries within Europe set by the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna "Congress of Vienna")

The [Seven Years' War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War "Seven Years' War") brought to an end the ["Old System" of alliances in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Alliance_\(League_of_Augsburg\) "Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)"). Consequently, when the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War") turned into a global war between 1778 and 1783, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.[^184]

The Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.[^185] [^186] [^187] Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution, and the establishment of the [First Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_First_Republic "French First Republic") as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial [reign of terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror "Reign of Terror").[^188] [Napoleon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon") Bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and established the [First French Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire "First French Empire") that, during the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the [Battle of Waterloo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo "Battle of Waterloo").[^189] [^190] [Napoleonic rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Empire "Napoleonic Empire") resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the [nation state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state "Nation state"), as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of [administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralised_government "Centralised government"), [law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_code "Napoleonic code") and [education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_France "Education in France").[^191] [^192] [^193] The [Congress of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna "Congress of Vienna"), convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new [balance of power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_\(international_relations\) "Balance of power (international relations)") in Europe centred on the five " [great powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power "Great power") ": the UK, France, [Prussia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia"), [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire"), and Russia.[^194] This balance would remain in place until the [Revolutions of 1848](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848"), during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[^195] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the [Austro-Hungarian empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_empire "Austro-Hungarian empire") was [formed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausgleich "Ausgleich"); 1871 saw the unifications of both [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification "Italian unification") and [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany "Unification of Germany") as nation-states from smaller principalities.[^196]

In parallel, the [Eastern Question](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Question "Eastern Question") grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_\(1768%E2%80%931774\) "Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)"). As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [Great Powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Power "Great Power") struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [Habsburg Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy "Habsburg monarchy") and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the [Serbian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Revolution "Serbian Revolution") (1804) and [Greek War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence "Greek War of Independence") (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the [Balkans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans "Balkans"), which ended with the [Balkan Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars "Balkan Wars") in 1912–1913.[^197] Formal recognition of the *de facto* independent principalities of [Montenegro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro "Montenegro"), [Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Serbia "Principality of Serbia") and [Romania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania") ensued at the [Congress of Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin "Congress of Berlin") in 1878.

Marshall's [Temple Works](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Works "Temple Works") (1840); the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") started in [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain").

The [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") started in [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain") in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment and the rise of a new working class.[^198] Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the [first laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts "Factory Acts") on [child labour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour "Child labour"), the legalisation of [trade unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union"),[^199] and the [abolition of slavery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_Kingdom "Abolitionism in the United Kingdom").[^200] In Britain, the [Public Health Act of 1875](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Act_of_1875 "Public Health Act of 1875") was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.[^201] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[^202] The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the [Great Famine of Ireland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_\(Ireland\) "Great Famine (Ireland)"), caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.[^203] In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.[^204] The industrial revolution also led to large population growth, and the [share of the world population living in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_world#Shares_of_world_population,_AD_1%E2%80%931998_\(%_of_world_total\) "Demographics of the world") reached a peak of slightly above 25% around the year 1913.[^205] <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-World_Population_Growth,_1950%E2%80%932050-184"><span>[</span>184<span>]</span></a></sup>

Map of European [colonial empires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_empire "Colonial empire") throughout the world in 1914

Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. The First World War was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when [Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria "Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria") was assassinated by the [Yugoslav nationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_nationalism "Yugoslav nationalism") [^207] [Gavrilo Princip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip "Gavrilo Princip").[^208] Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the [Entente Powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entente_Powers "Entente Powers") ([France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium"), [Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia "Serbia"), Portugal, [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), the United Kingdom, and later [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece"), [Romania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania"), and the United States) and the [Central Powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers") ([Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"), [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"), [Bulgaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria "Bulgaria"), and the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire")). The war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead.[^209] Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.[^210]

Russia was plunged into the [Russian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution"), which threw down the [Tsarist monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") and replaced it with the [communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist "Communist") [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"),[^211] leading also to the independence of many former [Russian governorates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorate_\(Russia\) "Governorate (Russia)"), such as [Finland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), [Estonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia "Estonia"), [Latvia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia "Latvia") and [Lithuania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania "Lithuania"), as new European countries.[^212] [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary") and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles"), which officially ended the First World War in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.[^213] Excess deaths in Russia over the course of the First World War and the [Russian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War") (including the postwar [famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921 "Russian famine of 1921")) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.[^214] In 1932–1933, under [Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin "Stalin") 's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the [second Soviet famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932-1933 "Soviet famine of 1932-1933") which caused millions of deaths;[^215] surviving [kulaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak "Kulak") were persecuted and many sent to [Gulags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag "Gulag") to do [forced labour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfree_labour "Unfree labour"). Stalin was also responsible for the [Great Purge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") of 1937–38 in which the [NKVD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD "NKVD") executed 681,692 people;[^216] millions of people were [deported and exiled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union "Population transfer in the Soviet Union") to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[^217]

[Serbian war efforts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Campaign_of_World_War_I "Serbian Campaign of World War I") (1914–1918) cost the country one quarter of its population.[^218] [^219] [^220] [^221] [^222]

[Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") began the devastating Second World War in Europe by its leader, [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"). Here Hitler, on the right, with his closest ally, the Italian dictator [Benito Mussolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini"), in 1940.

The [social revolutions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_revolution "Social revolution") sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following [The Great War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_War "The Great War"): in 1919, with the [Weimar Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") in Germany and the [First Austrian Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Austrian_Republic "First Austrian Republic"); in 1922, with [Mussolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") 's one-party [fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") government in the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy") and in [Atatürk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk "Atatürk") 's [Turkish Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), adopting the Western alphabet and state [secularism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism "Secularism"). Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This, and the [Wall Street crash of 1929](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_crash_of_1929 "Wall Street crash of 1929"), brought about the worldwide [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, [fascist movements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") developed throughout Europe placing [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") in power of what became [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").[^223] [^224]

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [Saarland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland "Saarland") and [Rhineland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland "Rhineland") in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria") became a part of Germany following the [Anschluss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss "Anschluss"). Following the [Munich Agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement "Munich Agreement") signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, later in 1938 Germany annexed the [Sudetenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland "Sudetenland"), which was a part of [Czechoslovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") inhabited by ethnic Germans. In early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia"), controlled by Germany and the [Slovak Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Republic_\(1939%E2%80%931945\) "Slovak Republic (1939–1945)"). At the time, the United Kingdom and France preferred a policy of [appeasement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement "Appeasement").

With tensions mounting between Germany and [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic") over the future of [Danzig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk "Gdańsk"), the Germans turned to the Soviets and signed the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact"), which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany [invaded Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland "Invasion of Poland") on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the [European Theatre of the Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II "European Theatre of World War II").[^225] [^226] [^227] The [Soviet invasion of Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland "Soviet invasion of Poland") started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [Baltic countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_\(1940\) "Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)") and, on 30 November, Finland, the latter of which was followed by the devastating [Winter War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War "Winter War") for the Red Army.[^228] The British hoped to land at [Narvik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Narvik "Battles of Narvik") and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The [Phoney War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War "Phoney War") continued.

In May 1940, Germany [attacked France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France "Battle of France") through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August, Germany had begun a [bombing offensive against the United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain "Battle of Britain") but failed to convince the Britons to give up.[^229] In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa "Operation Barbarossa").[^230] On 7 December 1941 [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan") 's [attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "Attack on Pearl Harbor") drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [British Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), and other [allied](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") forces.[^231] [^232]

The " [Big Three](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") " at the [Yalta Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference "Yalta Conference") in 1945; seated (from the left): [Winston Churchill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill"), [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") and [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")

After the staggering [Battle of Stalingrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad "Battle of Stalingrad") in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The [Battle of Kursk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk "Battle of Kursk"), which involved the largest [tank battle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Prokhorovka "Battle of Prokhorovka") in history, was the last major German offensive on the [Eastern Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\) "Eastern Front (World War II)"). In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [D-Day landings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings "Normandy landings"), opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally [fell in 1945](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin "Battle of Berlin"), ending the Second World War in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with [60 million dead across the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties "World War II casualties").[^233] More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of the Second World War,[^234] including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during [the Holocaust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust").[^235] The Soviet Union [lost around 27 million people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union "World War II casualties of the Soviet Union") (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all Second World War casualties.[^236] By the end of the Second World War, Europe had more than 40 million [refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee "Refugee").[^237] [^238] [^239] Several [post-war expulsions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_evacuation_and_expulsion "World War II evacuation and expulsion") in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people.[^240]

The First World War, and especially the Second World War, diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After the Second World War the map of Europe was redrawn at the [Yalta Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference "Yalta Conference") and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [Winston Churchill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") an " [Iron Curtain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain "Iron Curtain") ". The United States and Western Europe established the [NATO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") alliance and, later, the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact").[^241] Particular hot spots after the Second World War were [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin") and [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste "Trieste"), whereby the [Free Territory of Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Territory_of_Trieste "Free Territory of Trieste"), founded in 1947 with the UN, was dissolved in 1954 and 1975, respectively. The [Berlin blockade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_blockade "Berlin blockade") in 1948 and 1949 and the construction of the [Berlin Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall") in 1961 were one of the great international crises of the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War").[^242] [^243] [^244]

The two new [superpowers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower"), the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [nuclear proliferation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation "Nuclear proliferation"). At the same time [decolonisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation "Decolonisation"), which had already started after the First World War, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.[^36]

[Flag of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Europe "Flag of Europe"), adopted by the [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") in 1955 as the flag for the whole of Europe [^245]

In the 1980s the [reforms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost "Glasnost") of [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev") and the [Solidarity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_\(Polish_trade_union\) "Solidarity (Polish trade union)") movement in Poland weakened the previously rigid communist system. The opening of the [Iron Curtain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain "Iron Curtain") at the [Pan-European Picnic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_Picnic "Pan-European Picnic") then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the [Eastern bloc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_bloc "Eastern bloc"), the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact") and other [communist states collapsed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989"), and the Cold War ended.[^246] [^247] [^248] Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [fall of the Berlin Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#Fall_of_the_Wall "Berlin Wall") in 1989 and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.[^249] This made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible, and previously isolated cities such as [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin"), [Prague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague "Prague"), [Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"), [Budapest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest") and [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste "Trieste") were now again in the centre of Europe.[^223] [^250] [^251] [^252]

[European integration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration "European integration") also grew after the Second World War. In 1949 the [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") was founded, following a speech by Sir [Winston Churchill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill"), with the idea of unifying Europe [^37] to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for [Belarus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "Belarus"), Russia,[^253] and [Vatican City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City "Vatican City"). The [Treaty of Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome "Treaty of Rome") in 1957 established the [European Economic Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community "European Economic Community") between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.[^254] In 1967 the EEC, [European Coal and Steel Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community "European Coal and Steel Community"), and [Euratom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euratom "Euratom") formed the [European Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community "European Community"), which in 1993 became the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"). The EU established [a parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament "European Parliament"), [a court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice "European Court of Justice") and [a central bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank"), and introduced the [euro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro") as a unified currency.[^255] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central European countries began joining, [expanding the EU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union "Enlargement of the European Union") to 28 European countries and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[^256] However, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, as a result of a [June 2016 referendum on EU membership](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum "2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum").[^257] The [Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War"), which has been ongoing since 2014, steeply escalated when Russia launched [a full-scale invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine") of [Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine") on 24 February 2022, marking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War [^258] and the [Yugoslav Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars "Yugoslav Wars").[^259]

## Geography

General topographic map of Europe showing physical, political and population characteristics, as per 2024

Europe makes up the western fifth of the [Eurasian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") landmass.[^48] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[^260] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas to the south.[^261] Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps"), [Pyrenees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees") and [Carpathians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathians "Carpathians"), through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [Great European Plain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_European_Plain "Great European Plain") and at its heart lies the [North German Plain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_German_Plain "North German Plain"). An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, [fjord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord "Fjord") -cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Subregions such as the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula") and the [Italian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Peninsula "Italian Peninsula") contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [Iceland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland"), Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean that is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until [rising sea levels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise") cut them off.

The [largest European lakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_lakes_of_Europe "List of largest lakes of Europe") are located in the north of the continent. The [Volga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga "Volga") and [Danube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube "Danube") are the two longest [rivers of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_of_Europe "List of rivers of Europe"). Europe's largest [waterfall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall "Waterfall") (by [flow rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_waterfalls_by_flow_rate "List of waterfalls by flow rate")) are the [Rhine Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine_Falls "Rhine Falls") on the [Rhine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine "Rhine").

### Climate

[Biomes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome "Biome") of Europe and surrounding regions:  
[tundra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra "Tundra") [alpine tundra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_tundra "Alpine tundra") [taiga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga "Taiga") [montane forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_forest "Montane forest")  
[temperate broadleaf forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_forest "Temperate broadleaf forest") [mediterranean forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_forest "Mediterranean forest") [temperate steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_steppe "Temperate steppe") [dry steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_steppe "Dry steppe")

Europe lies mainly in the [temperate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate "Temperate") climate zone of the northern hemisphere, where the [prevailing wind direction is from the west](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevailing_westerlies "Prevailing westerlies"). The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [Gulf Stream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream"), an ocean current which carries warm water from the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") across the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") to Europe.[^262] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of [Aveiro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aveiro,_Portugal "Aveiro, Portugal") is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 13 °C (55 °F) in [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.[^262]

The large water masses of the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"), which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the [Sahara desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_desert "Sahara desert") to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea") near [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste "Trieste").[^263]

In general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th [latitudes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitudes "Latitudes"). None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea.

[^265] The average temperatures for the coldest month, as well as the annual average temperatures, drop from the west to the east. For instance, Edinburgh is warmer than Belgrade during the coldest month of the year, although Belgrade is around 10° of latitude farther south.

### Climate change

Increase of average yearly temperature (2000–2017) above the 20th century average in selected cities in Europe [^266]

[Climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") has resulted in an increase in temperature of 2.3 °C (4.14 °F) (2022) in Europe compared to pre-industrial levels. Europe is the fastest warming continent in the world.[^267] [Europe's climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Europe "Climate of Europe") is getting warmer due to [anthropogenic activity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_greenhouse_gas "Anthropogenic greenhouse gas"). According to international climate experts, global temperature rise should not exceed 2 [°C](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%B0C "°C") to prevent the most dangerous [consequences of climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change "Effects of climate change"); without reduction in [greenhouse gas emissions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions "Greenhouse gas emissions"), this could happen before 2050.[^268] [^269] [Climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") has implications for all regions of Europe, with the extent and nature of effects varying across the continent. Effects on European countries include warmer weather and increasing frequency and intensity of [extreme weather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather "Extreme weather") such as [heat waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave "Heat wave"), bringing [health risks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_human_health "Effects of climate change on human health") and effects on ecosystems. European countries are major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, although the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") and governments of several countries have outlined plans to implement [climate change mitigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation "Climate change mitigation") and an [energy transition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition "Energy transition") in the 21st century, the [European Green Deal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Deal "European Green Deal") being one of these.

### Geology

Surficial geology of Europe

The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [Baltic Shield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Shield "Baltic Shield") (Fennoscandia) and the [Sarmatian craton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatian_craton "Sarmatian craton"), both around 2.25 billion years ago, followed by the [Volgo–Uralia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgo%E2%80%93Uralia "Volgo–Uralia") shield, the three together leading to the [East European craton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_European_craton "East European craton") (≈ [Baltica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltica "Baltica")) which became a part of the [supercontinent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent") [Columbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_\(supercontinent\) "Columbia (supercontinent)"). Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [Laurentia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentia "Laurentia") block) became joined to [Rodinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia "Rodinia"), later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago [Euramerica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euramerica "Euramerica") was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [Gondwana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana") then leading to the formation of [Pangea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangea "Pangea"). Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and [Laurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia") split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [Greenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland"), leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the [late Tertiary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Tertiary "Late Tertiary") period about five million years ago.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica-248"><span>[</span>248<span>]</span></a></sup>

The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [Scottish Highlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands "Scottish Highlands") to the rolling [plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain "Plain") of Hungary.[^271] Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [Southern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe "Southern Europe") and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [Ural Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains") in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [Pyrenees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees") and [Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps") / [Carpathians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains "Carpathian Mountains"). The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [Scandinavian Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Mountains "Scandinavian Mountains") and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [Celtic Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Sea "Celtic Sea"), the [North Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea "North Sea"), the [Baltic Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea") complex and [Barents Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barents_Sea "Barents Sea").

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [Baltica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltica "Baltica") and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [microcontinent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontinent "Microcontinent") [Avalonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalonia "Avalonia").

### Flora

Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green) and tundra, or bogs, in the north (dark yellow)

Having lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of humans. With the exception of [Fennoscandia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennoscandia "Fennoscandia") and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [national parks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park "National park").

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest "Forest"). The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [Gulf Stream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream") and [North Atlantic Drift](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current "North Atlantic Current") warm the continent. Southern Europe has a warm but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these, such as the [Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps") and the [Pyrenees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees"), are oriented east–west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south–north ([Scandinavian Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Mountains "Scandinavian Mountains"), [Dinarides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinaric_Alps "Dinaric Alps"), [Carpathians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains "Carpathian Mountains"), [Apennines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_Mountains "Apennine Mountains")) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [livestock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock "Livestock") at some point in time, and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch

Possibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.[^272] It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [deforestation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation"), Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [broadleaf and mixed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest "Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest") forests, [taiga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga "Taiga") of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [rainforests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest "Rainforest") of the Caucasus and the [Cork oak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_oak "Cork oak") forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [plantations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation "Plantation") of [conifers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta "Pinophyta") have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5–10%. The European country with the [smallest percentage of forested area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_forest_area "List of countries by forest area") is [Iceland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland") (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).[^273]

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [broadleaf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant "Flowering plant") and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [beech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech "Beech") and [oak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak "Oak"). In the north, the taiga is a mixed [spruce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce "Spruce") – [pine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine "Pine") – [birch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch "Birch") forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [tundra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra "Tundra") as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [olive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive "Olive") trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [Mediterranean Cypress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressus_sempervirens "Cupressus sempervirens") is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east–west tongue of Eurasian [grassland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland "Grassland") (the [steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe "Steppe")) extends westwards from [Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine") and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

### Fauna

[Biogeographic regions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography "Biogeography") of Europe and bordering regions

Glaciation during the [most recent ice age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation") and the presence of humans affected the distribution of [European fauna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_of_Europe "Fauna of Europe"). As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [predator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator "Predator") species have been hunted to extinction. The [woolly mammoth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth "Woolly mammoth") was extinct before the end of the [Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") period. Today [wolves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf "Wolf") ([carnivores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore "Carnivore")) and [bears](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear "Bear") ([omnivores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore "Omnivore")) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [brown bear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_brown_bear "European brown bear") lives primarily in the [Balkan peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan "Balkan"), Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [polar bears](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear "Polar bear") may be found on [Svalbard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard "Svalbard"), a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [wolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_wolf "Eurasian wolf"), the second-largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [Central and Eastern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe "Central and Eastern Europe") and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [Western Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, [European bison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_bison "European bison") now live in nature preserves in [Białowieża Forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa_Forest "Białowieża Forest"), on the border between [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland") and [Belarus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "Belarus").[^274] [^275]

Other carnivores include the [European wildcat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wildcat "European wildcat"), [red fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox "Red fox") and [arctic fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox "Arctic fox"), the [golden jackal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_jackal "Golden jackal"), different species of [martens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marten "Marten"), the [European hedgehog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_hedgehog "European hedgehog"), different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, as well as different birds ([owls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl "Owl"), [hawks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk "Hawk") and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the [small tortoiseshell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_tortoiseshell "Small tortoiseshell") butterfly, add to the biodiversity.[^276]

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [phytoplankton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton"). Important animals that live in European seas are [zooplankton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton "Zooplankton"), [molluscs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc "Mollusc"), [echinoderms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderm "Echinoderm"), different [crustaceans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean "Crustacean"), [squids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid "Squid") and [octopuses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopuses "Octopuses"), fish, [dolphins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin "Dolphin") and [whales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whales "Whales").

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [Bern Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Conservation_of_European_Wildlife_and_Natural_Habitats "Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats"), which has also been signed by the [European Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community "European Community") as well as non-European states.

## Politics

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is [parliamentary democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_democracy "Parliamentary democracy"), in most cases in the form of [republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic "Republic"); in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the [monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe "Monarchies in Europe"). Europe's remaining eleven monarchies [^277] are [constitutional](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy").

[European integration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration "European integration") is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") since the end of the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"). The [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the [Eurasian Economic Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union "Eurasian Economic Union") has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.

27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free [Schengen Area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area "Schengen Area") and 20 of the monetary union [Eurozone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone"). Among the smaller European organisations are the [Nordic Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Council "Nordic Council"), the [Benelux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux "Benelux"), the [Baltic Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Assembly "Baltic Assembly"), and the [Visegrád Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visegr%C3%A1d_Group "Visegrád Group").

The least [democratic countries in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Europe "Democracy in Europe") are [Belarus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "Belarus"), Russia, and [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") in 2024 according to the [V-Dem Democracy indices](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Dem_Democracy_indices "V-Dem Democracy indices").[^278]

This list includes all internationally recognised sovereign countries falling even partially under any [common geographical or political definitions of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Europe "Regions of Europe").

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008.[^281] In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.[^282] As with other continents, Europe has a large [wealth gap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_gap "Wealth gap") among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [Northwest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Europe "Northwestern Europe") and [West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") in general, followed by [Central Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe"), while most economies of [Eastern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe") and [Southeastern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Europe "Southeastern Europe") are still reemerging from the [collapse of the Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union "Collapse of the Soviet Union") and the [breakup of Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia "Breakup of Yugoslavia").

The model of the [Blue Banana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Banana "Blue Banana") was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions, which was further developed into the [Golden Banana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Banana "Golden Banana") or Blue Star. The trade between East and West, as well as towards Asia, which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars, new borders and the Cold War, increased sharply after 1989. In addition, there is new impetus from the Chinese [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative "Belt and Road Initiative") across the [Suez Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal") towards Africa and Asia.[^283]

The European Union, a political entity composed of 27 European states, comprises the [largest single economic area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\) "List of countries by GDP (nominal)") in the world. Nineteen EU [countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone") share the [euro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro") as a common currency. Four European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [national economies in GDP (PPP)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\) "List of countries by GDP (PPP)"). This includes (ranks according to the [IMF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund")): Russia (4), Germany (6), France (9) and the United Kingdom (10).

Some European countries are much richer than others. The richest in terms of nominal GDP is [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco "Monaco") with its US$185,829 per capita (2018) and the poorest is [Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine") with its US$3,659 per capita (2019).[^284]

As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.[^285]

### Economic history

Industrial growth (1760–1945)

Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.[^288] From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.[^289] The [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,[^290] and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by the First World War, but by the beginning of the Second World War, they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. The Second World War, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

Cold War (1945–1991)

Fall of the [Berlin Wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall") in 1989

[Eurozone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone") (blue colour)

After the Second World War the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,[^291] and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.[^292] Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [recovered quickly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder "Wirtschaftswunder") and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.[^293] France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [Franco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco "Francisco Franco"), also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [Spanish miracle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_miracle "Spanish miracle").[^294] The majority of [Central and Eastern European](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe "Central and Eastern Europe") states came under the control of the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and thus were members of the [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_Mutual_Economic_Assistance "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance") (COMECON).[^295]

The states which retained a [free-market](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market "Free-market") system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [Marshall Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan "Marshall Plan").[^296] The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). Until 1990, the [European Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community "European Community") was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

Reunification (1991–present)

One of [Kosovo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo "Kosovo") 's main economical sources is [mining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining"), because it has large reserves of lead, [zinc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc "Zinc"), silver, [nickel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel"), [cobalt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt "Cobalt"), copper, iron and [bauxite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite").[^297] Miners at the [Trepča Mines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trep%C4%8Da_Mines "Trepča Mines") in [Mitrovica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrovica,_Kosovo "Mitrovica, Kosovo"), Kosovo in 2011.

With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states underwent [shock therapy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_\(economics\) "Shock therapy (economics)") measures to liberalise their economies and implement free market reforms.

After [East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany, while the latter [experienced sudden mass unemployment and plummeting of industrial production](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_German_reunification "Economic history of the German reunification").

By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe, comprising the five largest European economies of the time: Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [Eurozone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone"), replacing their national currencies by the [euro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro").

Figures released by [Eurostat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostat "Eurostat") in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into [recession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_2000s_recession_in_Europe "Late 2000s recession in Europe") in 2008.[^298] It affected much of the region.[^299] In 2010, fears of a [sovereign debt crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_sovereign-debt_crisis "European sovereign-debt crisis") [^300] developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.[^301] As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.[^302] The [EU-27](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012. For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%.[^303]

## Demographics

[Population growth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth "Population growth") in and around Europe in 2021 [^304]

The population of Europe was about 742 million in 2023 according to UN estimates.[^23] [^24] This is slightly more than one ninth of the world's population.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cnote_v">[v]</a></sup> The [population density](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density "Population density") of Europe (the number of people per area) is the second highest of any continent, behind Asia. The population of Europe is currently slowly decreasing, by about 0.2% per year,[^305] because [there are fewer births than deaths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility "Sub-replacement fertility"). This natural decrease in population is reduced by the fact that more people [migrate to Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Europe "Immigration to Europe") from other continents than vice versa.

Southern Europe and Western Europe are the regions with the highest average number of elderly people in the world. In 2021, the percentage of people over 65 years old was 21% in Western Europe and Southern Europe, compared to 19% in all of Europe and 10% in the world.[^306] Projections suggest that by 2050 Europe will reach 30%.[^307] This is caused by the fact that the population has been [having children below replacement level](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate "Total fertility rate") since the 1970s. The [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") predicts that Europe will decline in population between 2022 and 2050 by −7 per cent, without changing immigration movements.[^308]

According to a population projection of the UN Population Division, Europe's population may fall to between 680 and 720 million people by 2050, which would be 7% of the world population at that time.[^309] Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to [fertility rates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_rates "Fertility rates"). The average number of [children per female](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_fertility_rate "List of countries and territories by fertility rate") of child-bearing age is 1.52, far below the replacement rate.[^310] The UN predicts a steady [population decline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline "Population decline") in [Central and Eastern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe "Central and Eastern Europe") as a result of emigration and low birth rates.[^311]

### Ethnic groups

Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute [ethnic minorities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minority "Ethnic minority").[^312] [Romani people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") are the largest ethnic minority in Europe, according to [European Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission").[^313]

### Migration

Europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at nearly 87 million people in 2020, according to the [International Organisation for Migration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organisation_for_Migration "International Organisation for Migration").[^314] In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from [immigration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration "Immigration") of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total [population growth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth "Population growth").[^315] In 2021, 827,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU member state, an increase of about 14% compared with 2020.[^316] 2.3 million immigrants from non-EU countries entered the EU in 2021.[^316]

Early modern [emigration from Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration_from_Europe "Emigration from Europe") began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century,[^317] [^318] and French and English settlers in the 17th century.[^319] But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.[^320]

Today, [large populations of European descent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_diaspora "European diaspora") are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [Uruguay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay "Uruguay"), [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile") and [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), while most of the other [Latin American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America") countries also have a considerable [population of European origins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Latin_American "White Latin American")). Australia and New Zealand have large European-derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [Cape Verde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde "Cape Verde") and probably [São Tomé and Príncipe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe "São Tomé and Príncipe"), depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [White South Africans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_South_Africans "White South Africans") in [South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"). In Asia, European-derived populations, specifically [Russians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians "Russians"), predominate in [North Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia "North Asia") and some parts of Northern [Kazakhstan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan").[^321] Also in Asia, Europeans, especially the Spanish are an influential [minority population in the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Filipinos "Spanish Filipinos").[^322] [^323]

### Languages

Distribution of major [languages of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe "Languages of Europe")

Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,[^324] mostly falling within three [Indo-European](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages") language groups: the [Romance languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages"), derived from the [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language") of the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"); the [Germanic languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages"), whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [Slavic languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica-248"><span>[</span>248<span>]</span></a></sup> Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe, as well as in [Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") in Central Europe and [Romania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania") and [Moldova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova "Moldova") in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in [Gibraltar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar "Gibraltar") and [Malta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta "Malta") in Southern Europe.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica-248"><span>[</span>248<span>]</span></a></sup> Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_\(language\) "English (language)"), for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the [Baltic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_languages "Baltic languages") group ([Latvian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language "Latvian language") and [Lithuanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language "Lithuanian language")), the [Celtic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages "Celtic languages") group ([Irish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language"), [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic "Scottish Gaelic"), [Manx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_language "Manx language"), [Welsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language"), [Cornish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_language "Cornish language") and [Breton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language "Breton language") <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica-248"><span>[</span>248<span>]</span></a></sup>), [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"), [Armenian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language "Armenian language") and [Albanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language "Albanian language").

A distinct non-Indo-European family of [Uralic languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages "Uralic languages") ([Estonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language"), [Finnish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), [Hungarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"), [Erzya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzya_language "Erzya language"), [Komi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komi_language "Komi language"), [Mari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_language "Mari language"), [Moksha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha_language "Moksha language") and [Udmurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udmurt_language "Udmurt language")) is spoken mainly in [Estonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia "Estonia"), [Finland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary") and parts of Russia. [Turkic languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages "Turkic languages") include [Azerbaijani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_language "Azerbaijani language"), [Kazakh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language") and [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"), in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe ([Balkan Gagauz Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Gagauz_Turkish "Balkan Gagauz Turkish"), [Bashkir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashkir_language "Bashkir language"), [Chuvash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuvash_language "Chuvash language"), [Crimean Tatar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatar_language "Crimean Tatar language"), [Karachay-Balkar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachay-Balkar_language "Karachay-Balkar language"), [Kumyk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumyk_language "Kumyk language"), [Nogai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nogai_language "Nogai language") and [Tatar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatar_language "Tatar language")). [Kartvelian languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartvelian_languages "Kartvelian languages") ([Georgian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language "Georgian language"), [Mingrelian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingrelian_language "Mingrelian language") and [Svan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svan_language "Svan language")) are spoken primarily in [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)"). Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [Northeast Caucasian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Caucasian_languages "Northeast Caucasian languages"), most notably including [Chechen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_language "Chechen language"), [Avar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avar_language "Avar language") and [Lezgin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lezgian_language "Lezgian language"); and [Northwest Caucasian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Caucasian_languages "Northwest Caucasian languages"), most notably including [Adyghe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adyghe_language "Adyghe language")). [Maltese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_language "Maltese language") is the only [Semitic language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_language "Semitic language") that is official within the EU, while [Basque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language "Basque language") is the only European [language isolate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate "Language isolate").

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") [Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_National_Minorities "Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities") and the Council of Europe's [European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages "European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages") set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

[Romani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language "Romani language") is spoken throughout Europe by the Roma minority.[^325]

### Religion

The largest religion in Europe is [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians"),[^326] [^327] including [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic "Catholic"), [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") and various [Protestant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are [Lutheranism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism "Lutheranism"), [Anglicanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism "Anglicanism") and the [Reformed faith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_faith "Reformed faith"). Smaller Protestant denominations include [Anabaptists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptists "Anabaptists") as well as denominations centred in the United States such as [Pentecostalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism"), [Methodism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism "Methodism"), and [Evangelicalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Protestants "Evangelical Protestants"). Although Christianity originated in the Middle East, its centre of mass shifted to Europe when it [became the official religion of the Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_as_the_Roman_state_religion "Christianity as the Roman state religion") in the late 4th century. [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") played [a prominent role in the development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_Christianity_in_civilization "Role of Christianity in civilization") of the [European culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_culture "European culture") and [identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_identity "European identity").[^328] [^329] [^330] Today, just over 25% of the world's Christians live in Europe.[^331]

[Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") is the second most popular religion in Europe. Over 25 million, or roughly 5% of the population, adhere to it.[^332] In [Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania "Albania") and [Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "Bosnia and Herzegovina"), two countries in the [Balkan peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_peninsula "Balkan peninsula") in Southeastern Europe, Islam instead of Christianity is the majority religion. This is also the case in [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") and in [certain parts of Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Russia "Islam in Russia"), as well as in [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan") and [Kazakhstan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan"), all of which are at the border to Asia.[^332] Many countries in Europe are home to a sizeable Muslim minority, and [immigration to Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Europe "Immigration to Europe") has increased the number of Muslim people in Europe in recent years.

The [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism") population in Europe was about 1.4 million people in 2020 (about 0.2% of the population).[^333] There is a long [history of Jewish life in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Europe "History of the Jews in Europe"), beginning in antiquity. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had the majority of the world's Jews living within its borders.[^334] In 1897, according to [Russian census of 1897](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire_Census "Russian Empire Census"), the total Jewish population of Russia was 5.1 million people, which was 4.13% of total population. Of this total, the vast majority lived within the [Pale of Settlement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement "Pale of Settlement").[^335] In 1933, there were about 9.5 million Jewish people in Europe, representing 1.7% of the population,[^336] but most were killed, and most of the rest displaced, during [the Holocaust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust").[^337] [^333] In the 21st century, [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") has the largest [Jewish population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population "Jewish population") in Europe, followed by the United Kingdom, [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") and Russia.[^29]

Other religions practiced in Europe include [Hinduism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") and [Buddhism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"), which are minority religions, except in Russia's [Republic of Kalmykia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Kalmykia "Republic of Kalmykia"), where Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion.

A large and increasing number of people in Europe are [irreligious](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion "Irreligion"), [atheist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism") and [agnostic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism "Agnosticism"). They are estimated to make up about 18.3% of Europe's population currently.[^29]

The three largest [urban areas of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_Europe "List of urban areas in Europe") are [Moscow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"), [London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") and [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"). All have over 10 million residents,[^338] and as such have been described as [megacities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity "Megacity").[^339] While [Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul") has the highest total city population, it lies partly in [Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"). 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side. The next largest cities in order of population are [Madrid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid"), [Saint Petersburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg "Saint Petersburg"), [Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan"), [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"), [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin"), and [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") each having over three million residents.[^338]

When considering the commuter belts or [metropolitan areas within Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_Europe "List of metropolitan areas in Europe") (for which comparable data is available), Moscow covers the largest population, followed in order by Istanbul, London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Ruhr Area, Saint Petersburg, Rhein-Süd, Barcelona and Berlin.[^340]

European [megacities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity "Megacity")

[Moscow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow")

[London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London")

[Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris")

## Culture

Map purportedly displaying the European continent split along cultural and state borders as proposed by the German organisation [Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Committee_on_Geographical_Names_\(Germany\) "Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (Germany)") (StAGN)

"Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of [ancient Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") and its cultures. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of [Christendom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom "Christendom") (or more specifically [Latin Christendom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Christendom "Latin Christendom")), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially [against Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Muslim_conquests "Early Muslim conquests"), as in the [Reconquista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista "Reconquista") and the [Ottoman wars in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe "Ottoman wars in Europe").[^341]

This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into [Slavic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_Europe "Slavic Europe"), [Latin (Romance)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance-speaking_Europe "Romance-speaking Europe") and Germanic, but with several components not part of either of these groups (notably [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_culture "Greek culture"), [Basque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_culture "Basque culture") and [Celtic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Europe "Celtic Europe")). Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are [Strasbourg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg "Strasbourg") with Latin (Romance) and Germanic, or [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste "Trieste") with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots. Cultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe. Europe is often described as "maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances".

Different cultural events are organised in Europe, with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance, such as the [European Capital of Culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture "European Capital of Culture"), the [European Region of Gastronomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Region_of_Gastronomy "European Region of Gastronomy"), the [European Youth Capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Youth_Capital "European Youth Capital") and the European Capital of Sport.

### Sport

Sport in Europe tends to be highly organised with many sports having professional leagues. The origins of many of the world's most popular sports today lie in the codification of many traditional games, especially in the United Kingdom. However, a paradoxical feature of European sport is the extent to which local, regional and national variations continue to exist, and even in some instances to predominate.[^342]

### Social dimension

In Europe many people are unable to access basic social conditions, which makes it harder for them to thrive and flourish. Access to basic necessities can be compromised, for example 10% of Europeans spend at least 40% of household income on housing. 75 million Europeans feel [socially isolated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation "Social isolation"). From the 1980s income inequality has been rising and wage shares have been falling. In 2016, the richest 20% of households earned over five times more than the poorest 20%. Many workers experience stagnant [real wages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages "Real wages") and [precarious work](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precarious_work "Precarious work") is common even for [essential workers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_workers "Essential workers").[^343]

[^1]: [Transnistria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria "Transnistria"), internationally recognised as being a legal part of the [Republic of Moldova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova "Moldova"), although *de facto* control is exercised by its internationally unrecognised government which declared independence from Moldova in 1990

[^2]: Russia is a [transcontinental country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transcontinental_countries "List of transcontinental countries") spanning Eastern Europe and [North Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia "North Asia"). The vast majority of its population (80%) lives within its [European part](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Russia "European Russia").[^344] However, only the population figure includes the entire state.

[^3]: [Guernsey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey "Guernsey"), the [Isle of Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man "Isle of Man"), and [Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey "Jersey") are [Crown Dependencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Dependencies "Crown Dependencies") of the United Kingdom.

[^4]: [Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus "Cyprus") can be considered part of Europe or [West Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia "West Asia"); it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe. The population and area figures refer to the entire state, including the *de facto* independent part [Northern Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus "Northern Cyprus") which is not recognised as a sovereign nation by the vast majority of sovereign nations, nor the UN.

[^5]: Figures for [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") include the [Azores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores "Azores") and [Madeira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira "Madeira") archipelagos, both in the North Atlantic.

[^6]: Area figure for [Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia "Serbia") includes [Kosovo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo "Kosovo"), a province that unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, and whose sovereign status is unclear. Population and density figures are from the first results of 2011 census and are given without the disputed territory of [Kosovo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo "Kosovo").

[^7]: Figures for [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") include only [metropolitan France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France "Metropolitan France"): some [politically integral parts of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_France "Administrative divisions of France") are geographically located outside Europe.

[^8]: [Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") population for November 2014. Population and area details include European portion only: Netherlands and three entities outside Europe ([Aruba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba "Aruba"), [Curaçao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao "Curaçao"), and [Sint Maarten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Maarten "Sint Maarten"), in the [Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean")) constitute the [Kingdom of the Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands "Kingdom of the Netherlands"). [Amsterdam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam "Amsterdam") is the official capital, while [The Hague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague") is the administrative seat.

[^9]: [Kazakhstan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan") is physiographically considered a transcontinental country, mostly in Central Asia (UN region), partly in Eastern Europe, with European territory west of the [Ural Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains") and [Ural River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_River "Ural River"). However, only the population figure refers to the entire country.

[^10]: [Armenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia "Armenia") can be considered part of Eastern Europe or [West Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia "West Asia"); it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe. The population and area figures include the entire state, respectively.

[^11]: [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan") is physiographically considered a transcontinental country, mostly in Western Asia. A small portion of its territory is located north of [Greater Caucasus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Caucasus "Greater Caucasus"), considered part of Eastern Europe.[^345] However the population and area figures are for the entire state. This includes the [exclave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclave "Exclave") of the [Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic") and the region [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh "Nagorno-Karabakh").

[^12]: [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)") can be considered part of Eastern Europe or [West Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia "West Asia");[^345] it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe.[^346] The population and area figures include Georgian estimates for [Abkhazia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia "Abkhazia") and [South Ossetia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia "South Ossetia"), two regions that have declared and *[de facto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto "De facto")* [achieved](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition "List of states with limited recognition") independence. [International recognition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Abkhazia_and_South_Ossetia#Positions_taken_by_states "International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia"), however, is limited.

[^13]: [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") is physiographically considered a transcontinental country, mostly in West Asia (the Middle East). Turkey has a small part of its territory (3%) in Southeast Europe called [East Thrace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Thrace "East Thrace").[^347] However, only the population figure includes the entire state.

[^14]: The total figures for area and population include only European portions of transcontinental countries. The precision of these figures is compromised by the ambiguous geographical extent of Europe and the lack of references for European portions of transcontinental countries.

[^15]: [Kosovo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo "Kosovo") unilaterally declared its independence from [Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia "Serbia") on 17 February 2008.

[^16]: [Abkhazia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia "Abkhazia") and [South Ossetia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia "South Ossetia"), both of which can be considered part of Eastern Europe or [West Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia "West Asia") [^345] unilaterally declared their independence from [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)") on 25 August 1990 and 28 November 1991, respectively. Their status as sovereign nations is [not recognised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Abkhazia_and_South_Ossetia "International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia") by a vast majority of sovereign nations, nor the UN. Population figures stated as of 2003 census and 2000 estimates, respectively.

[^17]: [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh "Nagorno-Karabakh"), which can be considered part of Eastern Europe or [West Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia "West Asia"), unilaterally declared its independence from [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan") on 6 January 1992. Its status as a sovereign nation is not recognised by any sovereign nation, nor the UN. Population figures stated as of 2003 census and 2000 estimates, respectively.

[^18]: [Greenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland"), an autonomous constituent country within the [Danish Realm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Realm "Danish Realm"), is geographically a part of the continent of North America, but has been politically and culturally associated with Europe.

[^19]: The [Donetsk People's Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic "Donetsk People's Republic") and [Luhansk People's Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_People%27s_Republic "Luhansk People's Republic") are internationally recognised as being a legal part of [Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine"), although *de facto* control is exercised by governments which declared independence from Ukraine in 2014.

[^20]: Europe is normally considered its own continent in the English-speaking world, which uses the seven continent model.[^348] [^349] Other models consider Europe as part of a Eurasian or Afro-Eurasian continent. See [Continent § Number](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent#Number "Continent") for more information.

[^21]: The map shows one of the most commonly accepted delineations of the geographical boundaries of Europe, as used by [National Geographic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society "National Geographic Society") and [Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica"). Whether countries are considered in Europe or Asia can vary in sources, for example in the classification of the [CIA World Factbook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook "CIA World Factbook") or that of the [BBC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC"). Certain countries in Europe, such as France, have [territories lying geographically outside Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_spanning_more_than_one_continent#Non-contiguous "List of countries spanning more than one continent"), but which are nevertheless considered integral parts of that country.

[^22]: This number includes Siberia, (about 38 million people) but excludes European Turkey (about 12 million).

Retrieved 13 September 2020. \[Page 1\] ABSTRACT: Filipinos represent a significant contemporary demographic group globally, yet they are underrepresented in the forensic anthropological literature. Given the complex population history of the Philippines, it is important to ensure that traditional methods for assessing the biological profile are appropriate when applied to these peoples. Here we analyze the classification trends of a modern Filipino sample (n = 110) when using the Fordisc 3.1 (FD3) software. We hypothesize that Filipinos represent an admixed population drawn largely from Asian and marginally from European parental gene pools, such that FD3 will classify these individuals morphometrically into reference samples that reflect a range of European admixture, in quantities from small to large. Our results show the greatest classification into Asian reference groups (72.7%), followed by Hispanic (12.7%), Indigenous American (7.3%), African (4.5%), and European (2.7%) groups included in FD3. This general pattern did not change between males and females. Moreover, replacing the raw craniometric values with their shape variables did not significantly alter the trends already observed. These classification trends for Filipino crania provide useful information for casework interpretation in forensic laboratory practice. Our findings can help biological anthropologists to better understand the evolutionary, population historical, and statistical reasons for FD3-generated classifications. The results of our studyindicate that ancestry estimation in forensic anthropology would benefit from population-focused research that gives consideration to histories of colonialism and periods of admixture.
