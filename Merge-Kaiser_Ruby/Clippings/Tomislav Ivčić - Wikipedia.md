**Tomislav Ivčić** (6 January 1953 – 4 March 1993) was a [Croatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_people "Croatian people") [pop singer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_singer "Pop singer"), [songwriter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter "Songwriter") and [politician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician "Politician"). He died in a [car accident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_accident "Car accident") and is buried in Zagreb at the [Mirogoj Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirogoj_Cemetery "Mirogoj Cemetery").

A native of [Zadar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar "Zadar"), Tomislav Ivčić became one of the most popular singers and songwriters during his appearances on 1970s pop music festivals. His specialty was pop music inspired by [Dalmatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia") [folklore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore "Folklore"). One of his early hits included the [country-rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country-rock "Country-rock") influenced single "Nemam za kavu" from 1979. Ivčić also wrote and performed "Večeras je naša fešta", a song that would become a semi-official anthem of [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia"), often sung and performed whenever a Dalmatian athlete or sports team won a title or important game. He has written over two hundred songs and released twenty three albums during his career.

During the [war in Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_war_of_independence "Croatian war of independence"), Ivčić wrote the song " [Stop the War in Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_the_War_in_Croatia "Stop the War in Croatia") " which charted in the Top 10 in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") in 1991.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In February 1993 he ran as [HDZ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDZ "HDZ") candidate for House of Chambers of [Croatian Parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Parliament "Croatian Parliament"), and won a seat. A few weeks before he was supposed to take office, and shortly after a *[Globus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_\(weekly\) "Globus (weekly)")* [interview](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview "Interview") in which he was described as the "first Croatian senator," his automobile was involved in a traffic accident that would claim the lives of him and three other people.

His older half-brother [Đani Maršan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C4%90ani_Mar%C5%A1an&action=edit&redlink=1 "Đani Maršan (page does not exist)") is also an accomplished singer and songwriter, as well as his other older brother Vedran Ivčić, albeit to a lesser degree.
