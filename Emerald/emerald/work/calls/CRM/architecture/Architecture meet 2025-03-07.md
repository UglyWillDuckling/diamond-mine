## [[okta authentication on LUQA]]

will be option 3, on [[Okta]] only auth, the rest of the data in our db.
## [[Cypress testing suite|Cypress]] for testing

responsible: [[Ivan Culina]]

**<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">alternatives</mark>**: [[Playwright testing suite]], [[WebdriverIO]]

**decision**
- **not** on the [[golden path AVIV]]
	- not a mobile app
	- [[slmp project]] uses `Cypress`
- good developer exp.
- developers know it personally
- **not flaky**
- **no need** for cross-platfform support

note ðŸ“”: we might use [[Cucumber testing]]
