Intended to extend the functionality of [[work/Projects/Backyard/Backyard|Backyard]] without needing to put that much effort into modifying the existing code base as it is quite obsolete.

The modules should allow for much greater flexibility when two or more systems need to interact as the new module can serve as a **go between**  while at the same time being able to utilize new technical solutions without anybody knowing.

### example of using technical solutions

- A module can implement a queue or a cronjob on its side without any of the other systems knowing about it
