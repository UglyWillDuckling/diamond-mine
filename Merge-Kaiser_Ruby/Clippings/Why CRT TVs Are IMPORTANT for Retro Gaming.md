Hope you guys get some enjoyment out of watching this one, I put quite a bit of effort into it. Also I do wanna touch on how difficult it really is to record a CRT TV, these things will fight your camera tooth and nail. Given this it should be clear that this footage doesn't do my CRT justice, but I can assure you guys that this thing looks insane in person.  
  
I also wanted to say that the footage you see of NES games on my CRT is via the Wii emulator FCEUGX. So no Iâ€™m not using a modded NES or anything like that. But the Wii does output 240p so these NES games look as intended.
