***China Beach*** is an American [war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film "War film") drama television series set at an evacuation hospital during the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"). The title refers to My Khe Beach [^1] in the city of [Đà Nẵng, Vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang "Da Nang"), nicknamed "China Beach" in English by American and Australian soldiers during the Vietnam War.[^2] [^3] [^4] [^5] The series originally ran on [ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company") for four seasons from April 27, 1988, to July 22, 1991.

Created by [William Broyles Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Broyles_Jr. "William Broyles Jr.") and [John Sacret Young](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sacret_Young "John Sacret Young"), the series looks at the Vietnam War from the perspectives of the women, military personnel, and civilians who were present during the conflict. John Wells and Lydia Woodward joined the writing staff for *China Beach* beginning with the second season. Many of the show’s cast members appeared later on another Wells production, *ER*.

Set at the fictitious 510th Evacuation Hospital and [R&R](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%26R_\(military\) "R&R (military)") facility (the "Five-and-Dime"), the series' cast of characters includes [US Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army") doctors and nurses, officers, soldiers, [Red Cross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross "Red Cross") volunteers' and civilian personnel (American, French, and Vietnamese). The series also features the experiences of the characters when they return to the United States, either on leave or at the end of their tours of duty. The show does not shy away from showing the brutality of war; it provides a gritty view of the experience and its aftermath.

The show was inspired in part by the book *[Home Before Morning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Before_Morning "Home Before Morning")* (1983) written by the former U.S. Army Nurse [[Lynda Van Devanter]]. The show's character Nurse [[Colleen McMurphy]] roughly follows Van Devanter's experiences as a nurse in Vietnam. The book takes the reader from Van Devanter's wish to serve her country through the adventure she thought her deployment to Vietnam would be, her culture shock upon returning to "the States", and her struggles with [PTSD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD "PTSD"). The show was cancelled before it could fully address McMurphy's PTSD issues. Van Devanter died in 2002.[^6]

Season three *China Beach* cast (left to right): Ned Vaughn (Jeff Hyers), Ricki Lake (Holly Pelegrino), Michael Boatman (Sam Beckett), Dana Delany (Nurse Colleen McMurphy), Brian Wimmer (Boonie Lanier), Marg Helgenberger (K.C.), Jeff Kober (Dodger), Nancy Giles (Frankie Bunsen), Concetta Tomei (Lila Garreau), and Robert Picardo (Dr. Richard)

*China Beach* was a critically lauded, but poorly rated series. ABC persisted with the show for four seasons, but the final season was put on hiatus in December 1990 and did not air its finale until July 22, 1991. As a result of the scheduling, Dana Delany was eligible for (and ultimately won) a Best Actress [Emmy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award "Emmy Award") in the fall of 1992, a year after the series broadcast its final episode and over a year and a half after many of the scenes were filmed.

*China Beach* debuted in rerun syndication on [Lifetime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifetime_\(TV_network\) "Lifetime (TV network)"), on November 4, 1991.[^8]

Before being released on DVD, the series' only home video release was the 97-minute pilot movie on Warner Home Video, in 1990 (cat no. 11971).

Series Complete Collection Set cover

In December 2012, it was announced that the series, among the most-requested television shows not available through either VHS or DVD following its broadcast run, would be issued on DVD in a box set (including new interviews with cast members and various bonus features) and released on April 15, 2013, through StarVista Entertainment (affiliated with TimeLife). The collection includes 302 songs heard during the series.[^7] To mark the show's 25th anniversary, a 21-disc collector's set was released October 1, 2013.[^9]

Music rights long delayed the release on DVD. More than 250 songs were licensed; seventeen could not be, and were either deleted or replaced.[^10]

John Sacret Young stated prior to the show's October 2013 DVD release that he was working on a follow-up novel, titled *Reflections*, in which Colleen, now in her 60s and recently widowed, returned to Vietnam and reconnected with the retired Dick Richard and [venture capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capitalist "Venture capitalist") K.C. Koloski. Young had also hoped to adapt it into a TV movie.[^11] However, the novel was never published.

The show was inspired in part by a 1983 memoir by Lynda Van Devanter:
