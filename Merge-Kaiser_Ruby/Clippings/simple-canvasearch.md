## Obsidian Simple Canvasearch Plugin

Just install, set a shortcut for the search modal action, then you can use it to fuzzy-search and navigate within your canvas page.

## Settings

You can search note titles only or include note contents in the fuzzy search, but this can potentially slow you down if your canvas is very large as it is not optimized at all.
