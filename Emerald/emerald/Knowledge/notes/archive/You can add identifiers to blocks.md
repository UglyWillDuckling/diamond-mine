A **block** is a unit of text in your note, such as a paragraph, block quote, or list item.

You can link to a block by adding #^ at the end of your link destination followed by a unique block identifier. For example, [[2023-01-01#^37066d]].

`Fortunately`, you don't need to know the `identifier`. When you type the caret (^), you can select the block from a list of suggestions to insert the correct identifier.

## human readable
You can also create human-readable **block identifiers** by adding a blank space followed by the identifier. Block identifiers can only consist of Latin letters, numbers, and dashes.
