***Y: The Last Man*** is a [post-apocalyptic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction") [science fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") [comic book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book "Comic book") [series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_series "Ongoing series") by [Brian K. Vaughan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_K._Vaughan "Brian K. Vaughan") and [Pia Guerra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_Guerra "Pia Guerra") published by [Vertigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_\(DC_Comics\) "Vertigo (DC Comics)") from 2002 through 2008. The series centers on [Yorick Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorick_Brown "Yorick Brown") and his pet [Capuchin monkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_monkey "Capuchin monkey") Ampersand, the only males who survived the apparent global die-off. The series was published in sixty issues by [Vertigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_Comics "Vertigo Comics") and collected in [a series of ten paperback volumes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Y:_The_Last_Man_story_arcs "List of Y: The Last Man story arcs") and later a series of five hardcover "Deluxe" volumes. The series' covers were primarily by [J. G. Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Jones "J. G. Jones") and [Massimo Carnevale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Carnevale "Massimo Carnevale"). The series received three [Eisner Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_Award "Eisner Award").

A ten-episode [television series adaptation of the first volume](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man_\(TV_series\) "Y: The Last Man (TV series)") aired on [FX on Hulu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_on_Hulu "FX on Hulu") from September 13 to November 1, 2021.[^1]

On July 17, 2002, all living mammals with a [Y chromosome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome "Y chromosome") —including [embryos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryos "Embryos") and [sperm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm "Sperm") —simultaneously die, with the exception of a young amateur escape artist named Yorick Brown and his [Capuchin monkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_monkey "Capuchin monkey"), Ampersand. Many women die as a secondary effect of male deaths, such as plane crashes. Society is plunged into chaos as infrastructures collapse, and the surviving women everywhere try to cope with the loss of men, and the belief that, barring a rapid, major scientific breakthrough or other extraordinary event, humanity is doomed to [extinction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction "Extinction").

Yorick's mother, a member of the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives "U.S. House of Representatives"), commissions Agent 355 of the secret [Culper Ring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culper_Ring "Culper Ring") organization to protect Yorick. The two travel to meet geneticist and cloning expert Dr. Allison Mann, who works to discover why Yorick survived and find a way to save humankind. Due to damage at Mann's laboratory in Boston, the trio first travel across the country to Mann's other lab in San Francisco, then to Australia and Japan.

During the trip, the group is chased by multiple parties who know of Yorick's existence and want to capture or kill him for their own purposes, including an [Israeli army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_army "Israeli army") commando named Alter, the militant Daughters of the Amazon, and a ninja. They are aided by Yorick's sister, Hero, a Russian soldier named Natalya, an astronaut named Ciba, a former flight attendant named Beth who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with Yorick, and Rose, an Australian sailor.

In China, the group learns Mann's father, Dr. Matsumori, is also still alive and has created many clones of Allison Mann. He reveals to Yorick that Ampersand had been one of his lab animals he was experimenting on. He believes Ampersand had been inadvertently shielded by what killed off other Y-chromosome lifeforms as a result of one of his experiments and that this protection was transferred to Yorick via pathogens. He also reveals that Ampersand ended up in Yorick's care by accident. When Mann learns that Matsumori plans to murder Yorick before committing suicide, she kills him. Armed with the samples and information she needs, Mann stays in China to work on cloning.

Yorick and Agent 355 journey to [Paris, France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris,_France "Paris, France"), where Yorick is reunited with his ex-girlfriend, whom he wanted to marry before the die-off. After initially celebrating their reconnection, Yorick realizes he actually loves 355. After meeting up with 355, Yorick tells her how he feels and she reveals she feels the same for him. Agent 355 is killed by Alter using a sniper rifle shortly thereafter. When Alter attempts to capture Yorick, he defeats her and says he believes her dedicated pursuit of him was actually a roundabout way of suicide. He lets her live, and she is remanded into the custody of the Israelis. Yorick and Beth become a couple shortly thereafter and raise their daughter together.

Decades later, Dr. Mann has succeeded in cloning Yorick seventeen times, along with thousands of copies of a small number of deceased males. Most of the world enjoys peace and prosperity as economic and technological development has resumed. Yorick and Beth's daughter is [President of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France "President of France"). Yorick is institutionalized after making a joke interpreted as a suicide attempt. He is visited by one of his clones, who is the same age he was during the die-off event. After imparting advice to his clone, Yorick escapes.

The source of the plague that wiped out every living mammal with a [Y chromosome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome "Y chromosome") except [Yorick Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorick_Brown "Yorick Brown"), [Ampersand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand "Ampersand"), and [Doctor Matsumori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Matsumori "Doctor Matsumori") is never fully explained. A number of possible explanations are provided throughout the course of the series, but a definitive answer is left for the reader to decide. Discussing the cause of the plague, Vaughan is quoted as saying:

> I feel that there is a definitive explanation, but I like that people don't necessarily know what it is. In interviews we always said that we would tell people exactly what caused the plague. The thing was, we never said when we were going to tell. We weren't going to tell you when we were telling you, I should say. We might have told you in issue #3. There might have been something in the background that only a couple people caught. It might have been Dr. Mann's father's very detailed, scientific explanation. It might have been Alter's off-the-wall conspiracy theory. The real answer is somewhere in those 60 issues, but I prefer to let the reader decide which one they like rather than pushing it on them.[^2]

Three explanations are considered by the protagonists:

- **Failed clandestine attack on [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") (propagated by Lt. General Alter):** the Culper Ring created a chemical agent designed to prevent women from conceiving male children. This agent was introduced into China to cripple their economy; however, something went wrong, and the chemical agent instead killed males of all ages.
	- This is stated as the definitive cause of the plague in [Brian K. Vaughan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_K._Vaughan "Brian K. Vaughan") 's abridged script for *Y: The Last Man*, penned two years after the completion of the comic book series.[^3]
- **Dr. Matsumori's theory:[^2] viable cloning made males unnecessary, and thus mother nature destroyed them**  – the Y-chromosome had been "rationally self-destructing for hundreds of millions of years" and thus the birth of Dr. Matsumori's first successful human clone "triggered a time-bomb that had been ticking for millennia." In other words, the moment the [Y-chromosome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosome "Y-chromosome") became obsolete "nature righted its course." [^4]
	- Moreover, [Doctor Matsumori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Matsumori "Doctor Matsumori") had also discovered a "chemical compound that had an adverse effect on the genome of cloned mammals" which he injected into a [capuchin monkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_monkey "Capuchin monkey") (Ampersand) in an attempt to kill his daughter's unborn clone fetus. Yet, as fate would have it, Ampersand was misdelivered to Yorick and when the plague struck, the compound ended up having the opposite effect on non-cloned mammals, shielding all three of them from "God's wrath." [^4]
- **Cursed amulet (propagated by ancient mysticism and the Setauket Ring):** the plague struck the moment Agent 355 removed the sacred Amulet of Helene from the nation of [Jordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan"). The amulet carried a warning that if it was ever taken from its homeland, it would create a tragedy greater than the [Trojan War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War "Trojan War"). It is also suggested that the wedding ring Yorick bought for Beth may have protected him and Ampersand from the effect of this curse.
	- This was the first theory for the plague's cause presented in the series, with Agent 355 being warned about the amulet's curse in the opening pages.
	- Yorick's ring was a similarly supposedly mystical [Middle Eastern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") relic, alleged to muddle the bearer's gender in order to give a married man an aspect of his wife's femininity, and vice versa.

Other explanations put forth in the book include:

- The Earth cleansing herself of the Y chromosome, as believed by the Amazons.
- The [Rapture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture") taking all men and leaving women as a punishment for [original sin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin "Original sin"), as believed by an air traffic controller.
- The remaining (female) members of Sons of Arizona were convinced that the government was responsible for the plague, and the top government leaders were lying in wait to take over the country.
- Changes in the [Dreamtime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime "Dreamtime") affecting normal reality, as believed by some [Aboriginal Australians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians "Aboriginal Australians") and Beth.
- One member of the "Fish & Bicycle" traveling theater troupe advanced the theory the plague was a direct response to the exclusion of women from true parity in the performing arts, thereby upsetting the natural order. In support of this theory, it was speculated the total exclusion of women from the stage in [William Shakespeare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") 's day had resulted in pandemic outbreaks of the [Bubonic plague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague "Bubonic plague").

The film rights to the series were acquired by [New Line Cinema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema "New Line Cinema") (a [sister company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner "Time Warner") to Vertigo), and in July 2007 screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director [D. J. Caruso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Caruso "D. J. Caruso") were attached to the project with [David S. Goyer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Goyer "David S. Goyer") as a [producer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer "Film producer").[^5]

Caruso intended on finishing the script in the summer and filming during the fall of 2008. The script would be a rewrite of the original draft written by [Jeff Vintar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Vintar "Jeff Vintar"). Although Vintar's draft was faithful to the original comic book, the higher-ups at New Line Cinema seemed unable to fully embrace the material. A subsequent draft by Vaughan himself, which departed from his own comic considerably, was also unsuccessful in convincing the studio to proceed.[^6]

Caruso maintained that the source material was too much to be told in one film and his team decided to concentrate on the best first film they could, which would end somewhere around issue 14 of the comic series. The entire comic series as a whole would be plotted into three films.[^7] Actor [Shia LaBeouf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf "Shia LaBeouf"), who worked with the writers on the films *[Disturbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disturbia_\(film\) "Disturbia (film)")* and *[Eagle Eye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Eye "Eagle Eye")*, was considered to play the role of Yorick, but the actor considered the role too similar to the character [Sam Witwicky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witwicky_family#Samuel_James_Witwicky "Witwicky family"), which he portrayed in the [*Transformers* series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_\(film_series\) "Transformers (film series)").[^8] Caruso planned to use a real monkey, and not a [CGI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery "Computer-generated imagery") construct, to play Ampersand.[^6] Caruso also said he would like to have [Alicia Keys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Keys "Alicia Keys") for the part of Agent 355.[^9] [Zachary Levi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Levi "Zachary Levi"), who played the lead in the TV series *[Chuck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_\(TV_series\) "Chuck (TV series)")*, expressed interest in playing Yorick as he is a fan of the comic book series, even going as far as having his character [Chuck Bartowski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Bartowski "Chuck Bartowski") read the *Y: The Last Man* [graphic novel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel "Graphic novel") in the episode " [Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Versus_the_Nacho_Sampler "Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler") ".

Caruso remained "loosely attached" to the project, but New Line refused to acquiesce on its development as a stand-alone movie as opposed to the trilogy Caruso preferred.[^10] Caruso, maintaining "I didn't think that you could take Yorick's story and put it in to a two-hour movie and do it justice... I just feel like it's too much for one screenplay", ultimately walked away from the project.[^11]

In March 2012, former *[Jericho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_\(2006_TV_series\) "Jericho (2006 TV series)")* writers Matthew Federman and Stephen Scaia entered final negotiations to write New Line's adaptation of the series, following in the footsteps of Vintar, Vaughan, and Ellsworth. J.C. Spink, Chris Bender and [David S. Goyer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Goyer "David S. Goyer") were attached to produce; Mason Novick and Jake Weiner were named executive producers.[^12] Reports in September 2012 suggested [New Line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line "New Line") was enthusiastic about the draft screenplay produced by Federman and Scaia, and had begun meeting potential directors to hire for the project.[^13]

In January 2013, it was announced that [Dan Trachtenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Trachtenberg "Dan Trachtenberg") would direct the film.[^14] In June 2013, producer David S. Goyer announced having "a script that's as close as it's ever been," and suggested the film could go into production in 2014.[^15] However, in January 2014, Brian K. Vaughan stated, "It's my understanding that the rights to *Y: The Last Man* will revert to co-creator [Pia Guerra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_Guerra "Pia Guerra") and me for the first time in a decade if the planned New Line adaptation doesn't start shooting in the next few months." [^16] On September 24, Trachtenberg confirmed via [Twitter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") the film was "Not happening. But it's in trusted hands (the creators)." [^17] In a subsequent interview he noted that in fact, "The rights reverted back to Brian quite a few months ago." [^18]

In 2011, a loose adaptation of the graphic novel was made in Portugal by Luís Lobo and Bruno Telésforo as an independent [short feature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film "Short film") and school film produced by [Universidade Lusófona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidade_Lus%C3%B3fona "Universidade Lusófona"), which was premiered in the [Fantasporto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasporto "Fantasporto") film festival on contest.[^19]

In November 2010 French director [Louis Leterrier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Leterrier "Louis Leterrier") expressed interest in adapting the series for television.[^20] In October 2015, *[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter "The Hollywood Reporter")* reported that [FX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_\(TV_channel\) "FX (TV channel)") was developing a TV series of *Y: The Last Man* produced by [Nina Jacobson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Jacobson "Nina Jacobson") and Brad Simpson alongside Brian K. Vaughan, who would also be a writer for the show.[^21] In an interview with *Vulture* in July 2016, Vaughan commented the FX series was, "very slowly coming to life. No news I can share, other than that it’s all chugging along happily." [^22] In November 2016, it was reported that [Michael Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Green_\(writer\) "Michael Green (writer)") would be the showrunner for *Y: The Last Man*.[^23] [^24]

On April 5, 2018, FX announced it had handed out a formal pilot order and enlisted Aida Mashaka Croal to serve as co-showrunner alongside Green, with [Melina Matsoukas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melina_Matsoukas "Melina Matsoukas") as director.[^25] On July 11, 2018, FX confirmed the cast list for the lead characters in the TV pilot (titled "Y"), with [Barry Keoghan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Keoghan "Barry Keoghan") as Yorick Brown, [Diane Lane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Lane "Diane Lane") as Yorick's mother Senator Jennifer Brown, [Olivia Thirlby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Thirlby "Olivia Thirlby") as Yorick's sister Hero Brown, and [Lashana Lynch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashana_Lynch "Lashana Lynch") as Agent 355.[^26] Production commenced on August 20, 2018,[^27] [^28] and was ordered to series on February 4, 2019.[^29]

In April 2019, Green and Croal exited the series due to creative differences.[^30] In June 2019, it was announced that [Eliza Clark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Clark_\(American_writer\) "Eliza Clark (American writer)") would be replacing Croal and Green as the showrunner.[^31] In February 2020, it was reported that Barry Keoghan had exited the role of Yorrick and the character was being recast.[^32] Later that month, it was announced that [Ben Schnetzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Schnetzer "Ben Schnetzer") had been cast in the role of Yorick.[^33] The role of Agent 355 was also recast, with [Ashley Romans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Romans "Ashley Romans") replacing Lashana Lynch.[^34] The series premiered on September 13, 2021 on FX on Hulu. In October 2021, the series was canceled after one season, with FX citing financial disagreements over requests to extend the cast's contract by $3 million on renewal.[^35]

The comic series attracted wide-spread acclaim during its publication with *[Comic Book Resources](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Book_Resources "Comic Book Resources")* praising it as "a series that transcends the normal restrictions of most comic books" [^36] and *[Publishers Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly "Publishers Weekly")* claiming that it was "entirely convincing—and addictive." [^37] *[The Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")* called it "this wonderful, affecting, intelligent, humane story." [^38] Dan Phillips of [IGN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN") felt that "the conclusion of *Y: The Last Man* is as close to a perfect ending as you're likely to see anywhere in the history of comics." [^39]

Later reception was more mixed, with *[SyFy Wire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyFy_Wire "SyFy Wire")* writing that "the premise and execution are lazy, problematic" and "someone’s best imitation of what they think a feminist plot would be" [^40] and [Screen Rant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Rant "Screen Rant") writing of the series' "problematic treatment of trans men" and unintentional implication that "gender identity is a matter of choice." [^41]

The series currently holds a rating of 7.8 on ComicBookRoundup.[^42]
