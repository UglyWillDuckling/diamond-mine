The Game Boy Advance has gone from a has-been to a fond memory to a desirable old-school console. It is essentially a Super Nintendo you can cram in your pocket, and its library of games is one of the strongest in portable gaming history.

With so many incredible games, narrowing the list to the top 25 was a tough task, but all of these games stand out and have stood the test of time. Even if you might not agree with each game's specific placement within the top 25, you'll be hard-pressed to deny these titles' inclusion within the best games available for the Game Boy Advance.

Here are IGN's picks of the top 25 Game Boy Advance games of all time.

## 25\. Super Monkey Ball Jr.

**Image credit: SEGA**

Though THQ gave the Game Boy Advance rendition the moniker "junior," there is nothing small about this portable product. The Monkey Ball series began in the arcades and on the GameCube as a Marble Madness-inspired action game with tons of unlockable features and modes, and for the Game Boy Advance version the UK development studio Realism managed to squeak out every ounce of potential in the GBA's hardware to offer that same fun and frantic experience. The GBA version might not stand the test of time when compared to the rising power of other handhelds, but when it was released [Super Monkey Ball Jr](https://gameboy.ign.com/objects/480/480095.html). managed to really show off what the system could do, and it's rare to see a third-party developer pour so much effort into so many game modes on the portable system. Though the development studio didn't survive very long after Super Monkey Ball Jr.'s release, Realism went out with a bang with one of the finest console-to-handheld ports on the GBA.

## 24\. Golden Sun

Image credit: Nintendo

One of the first "hyped" games on the Game Boy Advance, Camelot – who had been making much of its money with Golf and Tennis games on the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy – returned to its RPG roots with an original adventure that gave Square's Final Fantasy teams a run for their money. [Golden Sun](https://www.ign.com/games/golden-sun) pushes amazing visuals, a dynamic soundtrack, and a complex story, and even though it focuses on the archaic "random turn-based battles" mechanic for half of its gameplay, it is still a fulfilling console-style experience on such a small system. Its sequel, [Golden Sun: The Lost Age](https://www.ign.com/games/golden-sun-the-lost-age), tweaked and streamlined a bit, and actually enabled data transfers from the first game in the series... but the original release had the biggest impact for Game Boy Advance gamers.

[Golden Sun and The Lost Age are now available on Nintendo Switch online](https://www.ign.com/articles/golden-sun-and-golden-sun-the-lost-age-rise-at-last-on-nintendo-switch-online), for those who want to revisit them on modern hardware,

## 23\. Ninja Five-O

Image credit: Konami

A bad name with even worse box-art, [Ninja Five-O](https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-five-o) hit the scene with a collective shrug from the gaming population. And then, suddenly, people started playing the game within. Its completely old-school inspired action design melds such classics as Capcom's Bionic Commando, Sega's Shinobi, and Namco's Rolling Thunder. What's more, it's incredibly fun and challenging – a side-scrolling arcade-style game that could only really thrive these days on the 2D-happy Game Boy Advance platform. It's one of the toughest games to find in the used cartridge market; finding it won't make you rich, though. It's only valuable in the "awesome gameplay" sense... and in this case, it's worth its weight in gold.

## 22\. Mario vs. Donkey Kong

**Image credit: Nintendo**

Way back in the black and white Game Boy days, Nintendo updated its classic Donkey Kong arcade game with a contemporary design that fleshed out the barrel-jumping, hammer-whacking mechanics into a huge assortment of full-screen puzzle games. That concept was the basis for this NST-developed production. The added power of the Game Boy Advance not just enhanced the visuals, but the team managed to squeeze in a bunch of new puzzle ideas in the update. It's a great game that fits the Game Boy Advance's pick-up-and-play environment since players could whip out the system, solve a puzzle, and put it away for later.

A [Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake](https://www.ign.com/games/mario-vs-donkey-kong-switch-remake) released for Nintendo Switch in 2024; read our [Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake review](https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-vs-donkey-kong-review) to see how it compares to the GBA version.

## 21\. Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town

Image credit: Marvelous Interactive/Natsume Inc.

You would think that hoeing the fields, milking the cows, and other menial tasks would make for an unbelievably boring videogame experience, but the Harvest Moon series manages to suck gamers into its economic-focused gameplay. The Game Boy Advance version works extraordinarily well because you can take the experience with you. In [Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town](https://www.ign.com/games/harvest-moon-friends-of-mineral-town), the goal is to live a full life on the farm, and you'll find hours upon hours just drifting away as you try to reach that mark. If you'd rather play as a girl, Natsume released Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town with slight tweaks to the translation and gameplay. This was a foundation for the Nintendo DS version of Harvest Moon, but its the original game that made the big splash.

## 20\. The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap

![[~/×/b99724c1605d72dea4664e54b902467a_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

Every Nintendo system needs a [Legend of Zelda game](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-games-in-order). It's almost the law or something. It took the Game Boy Advance several years before a development team hunkered down to create an original adventure for the portable system, and [The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap](https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap) is an incredibly fun and charming adventure that brought back a lot of the familiar 2D overhead game mechanics established in past games on the Super NES, NES, and Game Boy. The inclusion of the ability to shrink and grow was explored to some really good results, giving Link and players the ability to explore a world that would have normally gone unnoticed at the character's feet. There's a huge world to discover when you're the size of a bug, and the designers pushed some great ideas in this adventure.

You can currently play this Zelda game on the Switch with a [Nintendo Switch Online subscription](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost).

## 19\. Mario Kart Super Circuit

![[~/×/e5713b3090465e0832ecd7d665b70341_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

[Mario Kart Super Circuit](https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-super-circuit) was, literally, the premiere game for the Game Boy Advance. Though the game released several months after the launch of the system, it was the game Nintendo spotlighted at the debut of the hardware. It was the game that showed players that the Game Boy Advance had the ability to bring Super NES experiences to a portable machine, and in a way that blew away the visuals and audio of the 16-bit console. The game mechanics of Mario Kart were tweaked for Super Circuit, but the heart of the Super NES game is clearly here. The designers even exploited the GBA's single cartridge multiplayer function so that four players could hit some classic SNES courses without the need to buy a copy of the game. And after the competition? They went out and bought a copy anyway. Awesome work.

## 18\. Metroid Fusion

![[~/×/d5d2308bec72f866237ce14426af502f_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

By the time of [Metroid Fusion](https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion) 's development, the franchise had already been snagged by the GameCube as the ultimate first-person adventure. But for those who really wanted to go back to the roots of the series – and that's the void Metroid Fusion fills – the game is a throwback to the gameplay mechanics of the classic Metroid, Super Metroid, and Metroid I1, but it moves the story forward and gives Samus a sleek new look. It is an incredibly fun adventure with the traditional "Metroid Twist."

## 17\. Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2

![[~/×/a29991eecd186c08fbbdb0e4e9309911_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

Super Mario World is easily one of the top games in the 2D [Super Mario platforming series](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-super-mario-games) as it introduced new game mechanics to the mix, including branching paths, multiple exits, multiple endings, and, most importantly, Yoshi! The original game didn't lose a whole lot in the shrinking from console to portable 10 years later, which means you can get the same brilliant platform experience on the go with [Super Mario Advance 2](https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-advance-2-super-mario-world).

## 16\. Fire Emblem

![[~/×/a87d31de8ba35a55bef6d94cc85daaf9_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

Nintendo teased gamers with a couple of super secret hidden characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee, including Marth, from a game that was a Japan exclusive: [Fire Emblem](https://www.ign.com/games/fire-emblem-the-blazing-blade). Before then, most American gamers didn't have a clue what Fire Emblem was – or what they were missing out on. Nintendo used the release of Fire Emblem on the Game Boy Advance as an opportunity to bring this unique RPG-focused strategy game to the United States. And thank god it did, as it's easily one of the top games in the GBA library. Though many of the gameplay mechanics had been recycled in the more familiar (and available) [Advance Wars](https://gameboy.ign.com/objects/015/015424.html) game, the addition of characters who can permanently die really changed up players' techniques.

## 15\. Mario Tennis Power Tour

![[~/×/f9132600a3052ae14672c0857b103e6b_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

Camelot already proved itself in the realm of tennis and golf, so when the team announced that it was creating a follow-up to the Game Boy Color's Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Advance, we weren't surprised. [Mario Tennis Power Tour](https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-power-tour) features a much more fleshed out single player experience than its predecessor and adds more Mario characters and moves. The power moves are a cool addition, but luckily don't need to be in play at all times if you just want to hit the courts to play much more traditional tennis.

## 14\. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance

![[~/×/2b538dd8f7fd3d34a85cdcc3423a8ef5_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit Nintendo

At this point in the Game Boy Advance's life cycle, Square wasn't quite ready to bet the farm on the Nintendo handheld. The studio was carefully testing the waters, and one of its early games, [Final Fantasy Tactics Advance](https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-advance), revisted a PlayStation classic with a new and original storyline. This GBA game offers some great strategy, excellent characters, and really challenging gameplay in a take-anywhere form.

## 13\. Ultimate Card Games

![[~/×/d6adf5655d43523fbe69bb60741d6f6e_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Telegames

When you have a Game Boy Advance on you, you want to have a cartridge that has a tremendous amount of replay value. One with pick-up-and-play appeal. Telegames managed to create one of the few "must have" third-party games in the GBA line-up with a collection of card games that are near impossible to put down. Solitaire, Cribbage, Poker, Black Jack and a good number more are available in [Ultimate Card Games](https://www.ign.com/games/ultimate-card-games), and what's more, any multiplayer game can be sent to other systems without the need for an additional cart. On top of all this, the game has fantastic statistics tracking and a pretty awesome soundtrack to accompany the gameplay. If you haven't picked this one up, why the heck not?

## 12\. Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga

![[~/×/90526e10ce6a4cc2daab7d9b4c931cb9_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

The Super NES had Super Mario RPG. The Nintendo 64 and GameCube had Paper Mario. And the Game Boy Advance? Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga is the portable equivalent. Both Mario and Luigi work together in this unique action RPG game that borrows heavily from the Super Paper Mario design. The way players manipulate both plumbers together gives the game a unique feel, especially when you have to do very traditional Mario Bros. mechanics using both GBA buttons to do the jumping. The battles feature some real-time elements that add an extra element of player involvement to spice up the gameplay. And the adventure's also funny as hell. A can't miss, gang.

You can currently play [Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga](https://www.ign.com/games/mario-luigi-superstar-saga) on the Switch with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

## 11\. Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3

![[~/×/27cd1e1f55aef328ea936fcc41de3c8e_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

Even though this Super Mario game came before the time of Yoshi and other cool elements that were introduced in Super Mario World, this is one of the top games in the series. I mean, you can dress Mario up like a raccoon! Seriously, [Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3](https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-advance-4-super-mario-bros-3) features some of the most tough-as-nails level designs in the series. And if they weren't enough, you could buy a second Game Boy Advance, an e-Reader, a link cable, and a pack of cards to upload some brand new level designs that weren't built into the original cartridge. It was a concept ahead of its time.

## 10\. Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire

![[~/×/0318cec192415f4b583242cbdcc9af36_MD5.jpg]]

Image credit: Nintendo

We couldn't do a top game list without including [Pokémon](https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order), and [Ruby](https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/17/pokemon-ruby-version) and [Sapphire](https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sapphire-version) squeak in there with a place in the Top 10. And rightfully so, too. The Game Boy Advance game offers so much strategy, introducing multi-battles, double battles, innate abilities and natures, and the Condition status. These games might not be visual or audio marvels, but they've got it where it counts: gameplay.

## 9\. Metroid: Zero Mission

Image credit: Nintendo

Metroid Fusion may have brought the franchise to the Game Boy Advance, but it was [Metroid: Zero Mission](https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-zero-mission) that really validated its existence. The design, touted as a remake of the game that started it all – Metroid on the NES – was far more than that. It was a visual upgrade with familiar areas, but the designers took liberties with where the game went. Even when it ends, it doesn't – there is something else waiting for gamers, bringing a different style of gameplay that fits the overall Metroid theme. No spoilers here, nope!

## 8\. Final Fantasy 6 Advance

Image credit: Nintendo

Of all the remakes of the Final Fantasy series on the Game Boy Advance, none stands taller than the brilliant Super NES to GBA conversion of [Final Fantasy 3](https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vi). The numbering structure has changed to mirror the Japanese releases, but [Final Fantasy 6 Advance](https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vi-advance) is a remake of the final Final Fantasy game released on the 16-bit system in the US three decades ago. Awesome graphics, even better soundtrack, and the traditional Final Fantasy gameplay that can't be missed. It's known as the best 2D game in the series by the fans, and the fans have spoken: the game is the best one on the GBA as well. Even today, the GBA version of Final Fantasy 6 stands as the definitive version to many die-hard fans.

## 7\. Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island

Image credit: Nintendo

We'll go to the grave believing Yoshi's Island is close to, if not the best 2D platform game ever made. The original Super NES game introduced so many new gameplay elements that utilized the power of the FX chip to drive these ideas. The Game Boy Advance had enough power under the hood to bring back these elements without the need for additional processing hardware, and for those that missed out on the original console release nearly a decade prior, the Game Boy Advance does a brilliant job bringing the award winning gameplay and level designs to the handheld. It's a shame that Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy had to be destroyed in the move to portable. Otherwise, this is an incredible conversion that absolutely needs to be experienced on the GBA.

You can currently play [Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island](https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island) on the Switch with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

## 6\. Mario Golf: Advance Tour

Image credit: Nintendo

On the Game Boy Advance, "pick up and play" style gameplay is king. And nothing's more pick up and play than golf. [Mario Golf: Advance Tour](https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-advance-tour) is a portable follow-up to Camelot's incredible Game Boy Color golf game, which was a port of the Nintendo 64 console design. Almost mirroring that strategy, the GBA version took all of the elements of the GameCube game and shrunk them down for play on the portable. There are tons of course designs with tons of cool little hidden tricks that just can't be done on the real-world courses. Even with its 2D restrictions, Mario Golf: Advance Tour is one of the finest take-anywhere [golf games](https://www.ign.com/games/genre/golf).

## 5\. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2

Image credit: Activision

Back in 2001, Nintendo led us to believe that the in-development, soon-to-be-released Game Boy Advance system would be on-par with the Super NES for its gaming power. That's a pretty good place to be since, for years, we'd been playing Nintendo handhelds that were on the level of the NES system. We were certainly looking forward to playing lots of multi-layered side-scrolling platform games and racing titles using the system's Mode 7.

And then Vicarious Visions, best known for producing some great Spider-Man games for the Game Boy Color, stepped in with something absolutely breathtaking: a portable rendition of the brilliantly fun [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2](https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2-gba). Even though, due to system limitations, the game remains in a fixed overhead perspective, the Game Boy Advance version retains the look and feel of the home console skateboarding action game. It was an absolute stunner of a launch title for the handheld, and it's amazing to see how well it's held up over the years – even after a half dozen sequels over the course of the GBA's life-span, it's still a thrill to see the series' portable origins.

## 4\. Advance Wars

Image credit: Nintendo

In Japan, Nintendo fans had a series they could call their own: Famicom Wars, a turn-based strategy game that never made the localization move to North America. Which is a darn shame because the design's US premiere, [Advance Wars](https://www.ign.com/games/advance-wars) on the Game Boy Advance, has an unbelievably deep and fulfilling design that challenged console players in a unique way at the time.

Advance Wars offers it all: tough-as-nails strategic gameplay, an extensive single player campaign with tons of memorable characters and situations, tons of user customization in the form of a map creator, and full-on four player multiplayer mode where only one copy of the game is required for the network.

Advance Wars' release timing was unfortunate, shipping just a day after 9/11 in the US. The game was actually a US-exclusive release for quite some time, which was a surprise considering the game's origins as a Japan-only release on previous systems. The sequel added a few new gameplay elements that were followed up on a dual-screen version a couple year's later on the Nintendo DS, but the original game made the biggest splash on the GBA, by far.

## 3\. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords

Image credit: Nintendo

[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-w-the-four-swords) and Four Swords is, admittedly, a "mere" portable conversion of a Super NES game. But if any Super NES game deserved to be milked, it's A Link to the Past, easily one of the most memorable adventures in Link's career of saving Zelda. The GBA hardware handles the game admirably well, retaining the look, sound, and feel of the original Super NES game with very little compromise in the move to the handheld. The awesome classic remains a classic on the GBA.

What makes this game *truly* awesome is the multiplayer mode, Four Swords. Multiplayer Zelda? Are you serious? How could that be any fun? Only said by people who couldn't find four GBAs, four copies of the game, and enough link cables to keep everyone connected. This mode is a brilliant combination of cooperative adventuring and competitive ass-kicking, an idea that was expanded on in the GameCube game Four Swords Adventure. Traces of the Four Swords idea continued in the original GBA Zelda game Minish Cap, and there's more instances of the Four Swords influence in later Zelda games.

## 2\. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow

Image credit: Konami

Konami backed the Game Boy Advance horse from day one when it produced Castlevania: Circle of the Moon on the handheld as a launch title. The GBA series started out with a bang, and the arrival of the third game, [Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow](https://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow), ended its GBA run with a tremendous boom. Three games hit the system over the course of the GBA's life, and even though all three were amazing action adventures that offered something new with each iteration, Aria of Sorrow is the one we all remember the most. And it's not just because it was the final game on the GBA. All the new gameplay elements, additional characters, enhanced visuals, and amazing soundtrack pieces combined to produce one of the best games in the Castlevania series...for any system.

## 1\. WarioWare Twisted!

WarioWare Twisted!

If there was that one game that we would force into anyone's Game Boy Advance library, of all of the hundreds upon hundreds of games released for the system, it would be, without a doubt, [WarioWare Twisted](https://www.ign.com/games/warioware-twisted). WarioWare: Mega Microgames might have started the whole "five second gameplay" genre that's been sequeled and cloned over the years, but WarioWare Twisted took the concept in an innovative direction.

A gyroscopic sensor housed inside the cartridge turns the GBA into a twistable controller, and game designers had all sorts of fun coming up with awesome little challenges using this concept. Dial a phone. Turn a world upside down. Even play a modified version of Super Mario Bros. We should have seen it as a sign of things to come: the technology in the cartridge is what we're now enjoying in the Switch.

Unfortunately, even though this game can't be missed, it was missed. By many people. The game sold modestly and never really reached that coveted "million seller" that so many Nintendo published games enjoy. Perhaps it was the daunting size of the thick box on the shelves. Or perhaps it was Wario's ugly mug on the cover. Whatever the reason, it's disappointing to find that, with the tens of millions of Game Boy Advance systems and additional millions of GBA-compatible Nintendo DS games out there, only a small fraction of system owners played this one. Try to find a copy on clearance before you regret it and miss an opportunity to enjoy what we believe is the best game on the system.
