In the 90s and 2000s, technology was exciting and revolutionary. Cell phones, TVs, computer, cars, game consoles, and more were always introducing sleek new features that were changing the world. However, the past decade or so has seen a shift in how we perceive that nostalgic technology. With advancements in AI and addictive design, people are not so hyped about technological advancements anymore.  
  
This video goes over how revolutionary technology was in the 90s and 2000s, the homogenization of technology, and why we stopped loving tech so much in the 2010s.
