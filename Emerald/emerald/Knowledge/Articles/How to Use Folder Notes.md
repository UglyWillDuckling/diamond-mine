## folder notes plugin

Folder notes — This plugin is my current choice for using folder notes in Obsidian. It’s similar to AidenLx’s Folder Note plugin, but with a few added features including adding folder notes automatically and excluding folders from having a folder note created.

You can add a note in your vault that serves as a folder note template in this plugin, compared to having to input the template in the plugin settings with AidenLx’s offering. This is an improvement for me because I like to keep all of my templates in one folder, so I know where to access them for easy editing. When I store my templates in lots of different places, it starts to get confusing.

Another unique feature of this folder note plugin is that you can add an Obsidian `canvas` as the folder note instead of a markdown file. This is an excellent idea that caters to those who prefer laying out their content visually and drawing physical links between their notes that way.

Overall, this is a very capable plugin that I’d recommend above all others if you want a full folder note experience in Obsidian. It also appears to be under regular development, unlike some other folder note offerings.
