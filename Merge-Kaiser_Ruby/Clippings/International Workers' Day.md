**International Workers' Day**, also called **Labour Day** in some countries [^5] and often referred to as **May Day**,[^6] [^7] is a celebration of [labourers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour "Wage labour") and the [working classes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class "Working class") that is promoted by the international [labour movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement "Labour movement") and occurs every year on 1 May,[^8] [^9] or the first Monday in May.[^10] [^11]

Traditionally, 1 May is the date of the European [spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_\(season\) "Spring (season)") festival of [May Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day "May Day"). The [International Workers Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers_Congresses_of_Paris,_1889 "International Workers Congresses of Paris, 1889") held in Paris in 1889 established the [Second International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_International "Second International") for labor, socialist, and Marxist parties. It adopted a resolution for a "great international demonstration" in support of working-class demands for the [eight-hour day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day "Eight-hour day"). The date was chosen by the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") to commemorate a general strike in the United States, which had begun on 1 May 1886 and culminated in the [Haymarket affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair "Haymarket affair") on 4 May. The demonstration subsequently became a yearly event.[^9] The 1904 [Sixth Conference of the Second International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Socialist_Congress,_Amsterdam_1904 "International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904"), called on "all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the eight-hour day, for the class demands of the [proletariat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat"), and for [universal peace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace "World peace") ".[^12]

The 1st of May, or first Monday in May, is a national [public holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday "Public holiday") in many countries, in most cases known as "International Workers' Day" or a similar name. Some countries celebrate a [Labour Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day "Labour Day") on other dates significant to them, such as the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), which celebrate [Labor Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day "Labor Day") on the first Monday of September.[^13] In 1955, the [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") dedicated 1 May to " [Saint Joseph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph "Saint Joseph") the Worker". Saint Joseph is the [patron saint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint "Patron saint") of workers and craftsmen, among others.[^14] [^15]

Labor Celebration days existed in some European countries since the end of 18th century [^16] – sometimes on January 20 (France, 1793),[^17] sometimes on June 5 (France, 1867).[^18]

On 21 April 1856, Australian [stonemasons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonemasons "Stonemasons") in [Victoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_\(Australia\) "Victoria (Australia)") undertook a mass stoppage as part of the [eight-hour workday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day "Eight-hour day") movement.[^19] It became a yearly commemoration, inspiring American workers to have their first stoppage.[^20] 1 May was chosen to be International Workers' Day to commemorate the 1886 [Haymarket affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair "Haymarket affair") in [Chicago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago").[^21] In that year beginning on 1 May, there was a general strike for the eight-hour workday. On 4 May, the police acted to disperse a public assembly in support of the strike when an unidentified person threw a bomb. The police responded by firing on the workers. The event led to the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; sixty police officers were injured, as were one hundred and fifteen civilians.[^22] [^23] Hundreds of labour leaders and sympathizers were later rounded-up and four were executed by hanging, after a trial that was seen as a [miscarriage of justice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice "Miscarriage of justice").[^24] [^1] The following day on 5 May, in [Milwaukee, Wisconsin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee "Milwaukee"), the [state militia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_National_Guard "Wisconsin National Guard") fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard.[^26]

In 1889, the first [meeting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers_Congresses_of_Paris,_1889 "International Workers Congresses of Paris, 1889") of the [Second International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_International "Second International") was held in [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), following a proposal by [Raymond Lavigne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raymond_Lavigne_\(syndicalist\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Raymond Lavigne (syndicalist) (page does not exist)") that called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests.[^9] On 1 May 1890, demonstrations took place in the United States and most countries in Europe.[^27] Demonstrations were also held in Chile and Peru.[^27] International Workers' Day was formally recognized as an annual event at the International's [second congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Socialist_Labor_Congress_of_Brussels,_1891 "International Socialist Labor Congress of Brussels, 1891") in 1891.[^28] [^29] Subsequently, the [May Day riots of 1894](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day_riots_of_1894 "May Day riots of 1894") occurred. The [International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Socialist_Congress,_Amsterdam_1904 "International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904") called on "all [Social Democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy "Social democracy") Party organisations and [trade unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union") of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace." [^12] The congress made it "mandatory upon the [proletarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletarian "Proletarian") organisations of all countries to stop work on 1 May, wherever it is possible without injury to the workers." [^12]

In the United States and Canada, a September holiday, called Labor or [Labour Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day "Labour Day"), was first proposed in the 1880s. In 1882, [Matthew Maguire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Maguire_\(labor_activist\) "Matthew Maguire (labor activist)"), a [machinist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinist "Machinist"), first proposed a Labor Day holiday on the first Monday of September [^2] while serving as secretary of the [Central Labor Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Labor_Union "Central Labor Union") (CLU) of New York.[^30] Others argue that it was first proposed by [Peter J. McGuire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._McGuire "Peter J. McGuire") of the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") in May 1882,[^31] after witnessing the annual [labour festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day#Canada_\(country\) "Labour Day") held in [Toronto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto "Toronto"), [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada").[^32] In 1887, [Oregon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon "Oregon") was the first state of the United States to make it an official [public holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday "Public holiday"). By the time it became an official [federal holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holiday "Federal holiday") in 1894, thirty [US states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_state "US state") officially celebrated Labor Day.[^31] Thus by 1887 in North America, Labour Day was an established, official holiday but in September,[^33] not on 1 May.

International Workers' Day has also been a focal point for [demonstrations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_\(protest\) "Demonstration (protest)") by various socialist, communist and anarchist groups since the Second International. It is one of the most important holidays in communist countries such as [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [Vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam"), [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"), [Laos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos "Laos"), [North Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"), and the former [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") countries. Celebrations in these countries typically feature elaborate workforce parades, including displays of military hardware and soldiers.

In 1955, the [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") dedicated 1 May to " [Saint Joseph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph "Saint Joseph") the Worker". Saint Joseph is the [patron saint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint "Patron saint") of workers and craftsmen, among others.[^14] [^15]

Today, the majority of countries around the world celebrate a workers' day on 1 May.

[Eastern Bloc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc") countries such as the Soviet Union and most countries of central and eastern Europe that were under the rule of [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") governments held official Workers' Day celebrations in every town and city, during which party leaders greeted the crowds. Workers carried banners with political slogans and many companies decorated their company cars. The biggest celebration of 1 May usually occurred in the capital of a particular socialist country and usually included a military display and the presence of the president and the secretary general of the party. During the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), International Workers' Day became the occasion for large [military parades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade") in [Red Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square "Red Square") by the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and attended by the top leaders of the [Kremlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremlin "Kremlin"), especially the [Politburo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), atop [Lenin's Mausoleum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_Mausoleum "Lenin's Mausoleum"). It became an enduring symbol of that period. In [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), since 1982, party leaders led the official parades. In Hungary, International Workers' Day was officially celebrated under the communist rule, and remains a public holiday. Traditionally, the day was marked by dancing around designated "May trees".[^34] Some factories in socialist countries were named in honour of International Workers' Day, such as [1 Maja Coal Mine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maja_Coal_Mine "1 Maja Coal Mine") in Wodzisław Śląski, Poland. In [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"), the holiday was officially known as **Internationaler Kampf- und Feiertag der Werktätigen für Frieden und Sozialismus** ("International Day of the Struggle and Celebration of the Workers for Peace and Socialism"); similar names were used in other Eastern Bloc countries.

In [South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"), Workers' Day has been celebrated as a national public holiday on 1 May each year since 1995.[^50] Workers' Day started to get more attention by African workers in 1928, which saw thousands of workers in a mass march. In 1950, the [South African Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Communist_Party "South African Communist Party") called for a strike on 1 May in response to the [Suppression of Communism Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_Communism_Act,_1950 "Suppression of Communism Act, 1950") declaring it illegal. Police violence caused the death of 18 people across Soweto. It has its origins within the historical struggles of workers and their trade unions internationally for solidarity between working people in their struggles to win fair employment standards and more importantly, to establish a culture of human and worker rights and to ensure that these are enshrined in international law and the national law.[^51]

In 1986, the hundredth anniversary of the [Haymarket affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair "Haymarket affair"), the [Congress of South African Trade Unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_South_African_Trade_Unions "Congress of South African Trade Unions") (COSATU) called for the government to establish an official holiday on 1 May. It also called for workers to stay home from work that day.[^52] COSATU was joined by a number of prominent anti- [apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid") organizations, including the [National Education Crisis Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid#National_Education_Crisis_Committee "Internal resistance to apartheid") and the [United Democratic Front (South Africa)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_\(South_Africa\) "United Democratic Front (South Africa)").[^53] The call was also supported by a number of organizations regarded as conservative, such as the [African Teachers' Association of South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Teachers%27_Association_of_South_Africa "African Teachers' Association of South Africa"), the [National African Federated Chamber of Commerce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_African_Federated_Chamber_of_Commerce "National African Federated Chamber of Commerce"), and the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa, an organization that represented employers in the metal industries.[^53] More than 1,500,000 workers observed the call and stayed home, as did thousands of students, taxi drivers, vendors, shopkeepers, domestic workers, and self-employed people.[^53] In the following years, 1 May became a popular, if not official, holiday.[^52] As a result of the killings on 1 May 1950 and the success of COSATU's call in 1986, 1 May became associated with resistance to the apartheid government. After its [first universal election in 1994](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_South_African_general_election "1994 South African general election"), 1 May was adopted as a public holiday, celebrated for the first time in 1995.[^52] On its website, the city of [Durban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban "Durban") states that the holiday "celebrate\[s\] the role played by trade unions and other labour movements in the fight against South Africa's apartheid regime".[^54]

Celebration of the International Labour Day (or "International Workers' Day"; [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): *Journée internationale des travailleurs*) in [Montreal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal "Montreal") goes back to 1906, organized by the Mutual Aid circle. The tradition had a renaissance at the time of a mass strike in 1972. On the 1973 Labour Day, the first contemporary demonstration was organized by the major trade union confederations; over 30,000 trade unionists took part in this demonstration. Further, it is the customary date on which the [minimum wage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_Canada "Minimum wage in Canada") rises.[^65]

In 1947, 1 May was established as [Loyalty Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_Day "Loyalty Day") by the U.S. [Veterans of Foreign Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars "Veterans of Foreign Wars") as a way to counter communist influence and recruitment at International Workers' Day rallies.[^82] Loyalty Day was celebrated across the country with patriotic parades and ceremonies, however the growing conflict over U.S. involvement in Vietnam detracted from the popularity of these celebrations.[^82] In 1958, the [American Bar Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association "American Bar Association") campaigned to have 1 May designated as [Law Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Day_\(United_States\) "Law Day (United States)"), which was acknowledged in 1961 by a joint resolution of Congress.[^83] Law Day exercises, such as mock trials and courthouse tours, are often sponsored by the American Bar Association.

Unions and Political organizations including [anarchist groups and socialist and communist parties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Left "American Left") have kept the International Workers' Day tradition alive with rallies and demonstrations. In 1919 especially large demonstrations took place, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in [Boston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"), [New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), and [Cleveland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland "Cleveland") and [a number of people were killed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day_Riots_of_1919 "May Day Riots of 1919").[^84] [^85] In Milwaukee, an annual commemoration takes place at the site of the killing of seven workers during an 8-hour march.[^26] Some of the largest examples of this occurred during the [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") of the 1930s, when hundreds of thousands of workers marched in International Workers' Day [parades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade "Parade") in New York's [Union Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Square_\(New_York_City\) "Union Square (New York City)"), while cities like [Chicago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago") and [Duluth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota "Duluth, Minnesota") saw large demonstrations organized by the [Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA").

[San Jose, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California "San Jose, California"), Workers' Day March, 1 May 2006

In 2006, 1 May was chosen by mostly [Latino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans "Hispanic and Latino Americans") [immigrant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant "Immigrant") groups in the United States as the day for the [Great American Boycott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Boycott "Great American Boycott"), a [general strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike "General strike") of undocumented immigrant workers and supporters to protest [H.R. 4437](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Protection,_Anti-terrorism,_and_Illegal_Immigration_Control_Act_of_2005 "Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005"), immigration reform legislation that they felt was draconian. From 10 April to 1 May of that year, immigrant families in the U.S. called for immigrant rights, workers' rights and amnesty for undocumented workers. They were joined by socialist and other leftist organizations on 1 May.[^86] [^87] On 1 May 2007, a mostly peaceful demonstration in [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") in support of undocumented immigrant workers ended with a widely televised [dispersal by police officers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_May_Day_m%C3%AAl%C3%A9e "Los Angeles May Day mêlée"). In March 2008, the [International Longshore and Warehouse Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union "International Longshore and Warehouse Union") announced that [dockworkers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevedore "Stevedore") will move no [cargo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo "Cargo") at any [West Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States "West Coast of the United States") ports on 1 May 2008, as a protest against the continuation of the [Iraq War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War") and the diversion of resources from domestic needs.[^88]

On 1 May 2012, members of [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street "Occupy Wall Street") and labor unions held protests together in a number of cities in the United States and Canada to commemorate International Workers' Day and to protest the state of the economy and economic inequality.[^89] [^90]

[^93] Additionally, on the same day, there will be a [rent strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_strike "Rent strike"), the largest in nearly a century.[^94]

On 1 May 2021, [black bloc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc "Black bloc") protesters clashed with police in Oakland & Portland. Numerous other activities occurred across the country.[^95]

In Uruguay, 1 May – Workers' Day – is an official holiday. Even when it is associated with labour unions, almost all workers tend to respect it. Since the late 1990s, the main event takes place at the [First of May Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_of_May_Square,_Montevideo&action=edit&redlink=1 "First of May Square, Montevideo (page does not exist)") in Montevideo.[^96]

In [Venezuela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela "Venezuela"), Workers' Day (*El Día del Trabajador*) is celebrated on 1 May since 1936, but from 1938 to 1945 it was held on 24 July, by an order of [Eleazar López Contreras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_L%C3%B3pez_Contreras "Eleazar López Contreras"). However, [Isaías Medina Angarita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isa%C3%ADas_Medina_Angarita "Isaías Medina Angarita") changed it back to 1 May in 1945.[^97]

International Workers' Day celebration in Beijing on 1 May 1952

1 May is a statutory holiday in the [People's Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"). It was a three-day holiday before 2008, but was only one day from 2008 onward.[^98] [^99] During a [Golden Week](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_\(China\) "Golden Week (China)"), surrounding weekends are rescheduled so that workers have seven continuous days off before 2009 and four to five continuous days after 2018.[^100]

2011 [National Trade Union Council (*Zenrokyo*)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenrokyo "Zenrokyo") May Day march, Tokyo

International Workers' Day is not officially designated by the Japanese government as a national holiday, but as it lies between other national holidays, it is a day off work for the vast majority of Japanese workers. Many employers give it as a day off, and otherwise workers take it as "paid leave". 1 May occurs during " [Golden Week](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_\(Japan\) "Golden Week (Japan)") ", together with 29 April (" [Shōwa Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dwa_Day "Shōwa Day") "), 3 May (" [Constitution Memorial Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Memorial_Day "Constitution Memorial Day") "), 4 May (" [Greenery Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenery_Day "Greenery Day") ") and 5 May (" [Children's Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodomo_no_hi "Kodomo no hi") ").[^105] Workers generally take the day off work not so much to join street rallies or labour union gatherings, but more to go on holiday for several consecutive days (in Japanese corporate culture, taking weekdays off for personal pleasure is widely frowned upon).

Some major labour unions organize rallies and demonstrations in [Tokyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo"),[^106] [Osaka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka "Osaka"), and [Nagoya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya "Nagoya").[^107] Japan has a long history of labour activism and has had a communist and socialist party in the [Diet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Diet "Japanese Diet") since 1945. In 2008, the National Confederation of Trade Unions (*[Zenrōren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenr%C5%8Dren "Zenrōren")*) held a rally in [Yoyogi Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoyogi_Park "Yoyogi Park") attended by 44,000 participants, while the National Trade Unions Council (*[Zenrōkyō](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenrokyo "Zenrokyo")*) held its International Workers' Day rally at [Hibiya Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibiya_Park "Hibiya Park").*[Rengō](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RENGO "RENGO")*, the largest Japanese trade union, held its International Workers' Day rally on the following Saturday (3 May), allegedly to distance itself from the more radical labour unions.

In the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_People%27s_Republic_of_Korea "Democratic People's Republic of Korea"), 1 May is known as International Workers' Day, and is a public holiday. Celebrations, local meetings and rallies are held every year throughout the country to honor the holiday.[^108] The [Rungnado May Day Stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungnado_May_Day_Stadium "Rungnado May Day Stadium") in the capital of [Pyongyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang "Pyongyang") is named in honor of the holiday.

In the [Republic of Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea "Republic of Korea"), 1 May is known simply as "Workers' Day". It is not a public holiday, but a paid holiday for workers by the [Designation of Workers' Day Act](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/ko:%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD_%EA%B7%BC%EB%A1%9C%EC%9E%90%EC%9D%98%EB%82%A0%EC%A0%9C%EC%A0%95%EC%97%90%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%EB%B2%95%EB%A5%A0 "s:ko:대한민국 근로자의날제정에관한법률").[^3]

Most people celebrate this holiday by visiting natural parks and resorts. Additionally, in some places public events are organized. In its capital city, Sarajevo, 12 and 13 June are also celebrated as Labour day due to its many natural parks and springs.

Labour Day is one of the [public holidays in Bulgaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Bulgaria "Public holidays in Bulgaria"), where it is known as *Labour Day and International Workers' Solidarity Day* ([Bulgarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language "Bulgarian language"): Ден на труда и на международната работническа солидарност) and celebrated annually on 1 May.[^114] The first attempt to celebrate it was in 1890 by the Bulgarian Typographical Association. In 1939, Labour Day was declared an official holiday. Since 1945 the communist authorities in the [People's Republic of Bulgaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria "People's Republic of Bulgaria") began to celebrate the holiday every year. After the end of socialism in Bulgaria in 1989 Labour Day continues to be an official and public holiday, but state authorities are not committed to the organization of mass events.

In Croatia, 1 May is a national holiday, Labour Day. Many public events are organized and held all over the country where bean soup is given out to all people as a symbol of a real workers' dish. Red carnations are also handed out to symbolise the origin of the day. In [Zagreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb "Zagreb"), the capital, a major gathering is in [Maksimir Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maksimir_Park "Maksimir Park"), which is located in the east part of Zagreb. In Split, city on the coast, people go to Marjan, a park-forest at the western end of Split peninsula.[^115]

In Cyprus, 1 May ([Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Εργατική Πρωτομαγιά) is considered as an official Public Holiday (Labour Day). In general, all stores remain closed in public and private sector. The Labor Union and Syndicates celebrate with various festivals and events across the country.

In the Czech Republic, 1 May is an official and national holiday known as Labour Day ([Czech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language"): *Svátek práce*).[^116]

In [Denmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark "Denmark"), 1 May is not an official holiday, but a variety of individuals, mostly in the public sector, construction industry, and production industry, get a half or a whole day off. It was first celebrated in [Copenhagen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen "Copenhagen") in 1890. The location of the first celebration, the [Fælledparken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A6lledparken "Fælledparken"), still plays an important part today with speeches by politicians and trade unionists to mark the occasion. Many other events are also held around the country to commemorate the day.[^117]

A Workers' Day rally in [Helsinki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki "Helsinki"), Finland

In Finland, 1 May is an official and national holiday. It is mainly celebrated as a feast of students, and spring, called *[vappu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vappu "Vappu")* or Walpurgis Night.[^118] Finland also celebrates Workers' Day (officially: *suomalaisen työn päivä*, "day of Finnish labour") on the same day.

Workers' Day demonstration in [Lyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon "Lyon"), France

In France, 1 May is a public holiday called Workers' Day ([French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): *Fête du Travail*). It is, in fact, the only day of the year when employees are legally obliged to be given leave, save professions that cannot be interrupted due to their nature (such as workers in hospitals and public transport).[^119] Demonstrations and marches are a Labour Day tradition in France, where trade unions organize parades in major cities to defend workers' rights. It is also customary to offer a [lily of the valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_valley "Lily of the valley") to friends or family. This custom dates back to 1561, when king [Charles IX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IX_of_France "Charles IX of France"), aged 10, waiting for his accession to the throne, gave a lily of the valley to all ladies present. Today, the fiscal administration exempts individuals and workers' organizations from any tax or administrative duties related to the sales of lilies of the valley, provided they are gathered from the wild, and not bought to be resold.

In April 1933, the recently installed [Nazi government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") declared 1 May the "Day of National Work", an official state holiday, and announced that all celebrations were to be organized by the government. Any separate celebrations by [Communists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany "Communist Party of Germany"), [Social Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany "Social Democratic Party of Germany") or [labour unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union") were banned. After [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), 1 May remained a state holiday in both [East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") and [West Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany"). In communist [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"), workers were *de facto* required to participate in large state-organized parades on International Workers' Day. Today in Germany it is simply called "Labour Day" (*Tag der Arbeit*), and there are numerous demonstrations and celebrations by independent workers' organizations. Today, [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin") witnesses yearly demonstrations on Labour Day, the largest organised by labour unions, political parties, the [far left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_left "Far left") and the leftist *[Autonomen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomism "Autonomism")*.

Labour Day rally in [Hanover](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover"), Germany, 1 May 2013

Since 1987, Labour Day has also become known for riots in some districts of Berlin. After police actions against radical leftists in that year's annual demonstrations, the [Autonomen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomism "Autonomism") scattered and sought cover at the ongoing annual street fair in [Kreuzberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg "Kreuzberg"). Three years prior to the [reunification of Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_of_Germany "Reunification of Germany"), violent protests would only take place in the former [West Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin"). The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building [barricades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barricade "Barricade") after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance. Cars were set on fire, shops plundered and burned to the ground. The police eventually ended the riots the following night. These violent forms of protests by the radical left later increasingly involved participants without political motivation.[^120]

Annual street fairs have proven an effective way to prevent riots, and Labour Day in 2005 and 2006 have been among the most peaceful known to Berlin in nearly 25 years. In recent years, [neo-Nazis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism "Neo-Nazism") and other groups on the [far right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_right "Far right"), such as the [National Democratic Party of Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany "National Democratic Party of Germany"), have used the day to schedule public demonstrations, often leading to clashes with left-wing protesters, which turned especially violent in [Leipzig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig "Leipzig") in 1998 and 2005.

Labour Day violence flared up again in 2010. After an approved far-right demonstration was blocked by leftists, a parade by an estimated 10,000 leftists and anarchists turned violent and resulted in an active response by the [Berlin Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Police "Berlin Police").[^121]

In Greece, 1 May is an optional public holiday, but is treated by workers as a strike. The [Ministry of Labour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Labour_and_Social_Affairs_\(Greece\) "Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Greece)") retains the right to classify it as an official public holiday on an annual basis, and it customarily does so.[^122] The day is called *Ergatikí Proto-magiá* (Εργατική Πρωτομαγιά, lit. "Workers' 1 May") and celebrations are marked by demonstrations in which left-wing political parties, anti-authority groups, and workers' unions participate. On Workers' Day in 2010, there were major protests all over Greece, most notably [Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") and [Thessaloniki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki "Thessaloniki"), by many left, anarchist and communist supporters and some violent clashes with [riot police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police "Riot police") who were sent out to contain the protesters. They opposed economic reforms, an end to job losses and wage cuts in the face of the government's proposals of massive public spending cuts. These reforms are to fall in line with the [IMF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") - [EU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") - [ECB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank") loan proposals, which demand that Greece liberalize its economy and cut its public spending and private sector wages, which many believe will decrease living standards.[^123]

Hungary celebrates 1 May as a national holiday, Workers' Day ([Hungarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"): *A munka ünnepe*), with open-air festivities and fairs all over the country. Many towns raise May poles and festivals with various themes are organized around the holiday. Left-wing parties and trade unions hold public rallies commemorating Labour Day.[^124]

In Iceland, Labour Day ([Icelandic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language "Icelandic language"): *Baráttudagur verkalýðsins*) is a public holiday. The first demonstration for workers rights in Iceland occurred in 1923. A parade composed of trade unions and other groups marches through towns and cities across the country and speeches are delivered.[^125] However, some private businesses are open, mainly in the capital.[^126]

International Workers' Day parade in [Belfast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast "Belfast"), 2011

The [Irish Congress of Trade Unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Congress_of_Trade_Unions "Irish Congress of Trade Unions") (ICTU) marks International Workers' Day with rallies in [Belfast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast "Belfast") and [Dublin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin "Dublin") and other events such as lectures, concerts and film screenings also take place around a wider International Workers' Day festival.[^127] [^128] The first Monday in May has been a [public holiday in the Republic of Ireland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland "Public holiday in the Republic of Ireland") since 1994 [^129] and in Northern Ireland since 1978.[^130] In the Republic the public holiday was demanded by the ICTU [^131] and proposed by the [Labour Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(Ireland\) "Labour Party (Ireland)") in negotiating [its 1992–94 coalition government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_Government_of_Ireland "23rd Government of Ireland") with [Fianna Fáil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il "Fianna Fáil"), and marked the centenary of the ICTU's predecessor, the [Irish Trades Union Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Trades_Union_Congress "Irish Trades Union Congress").[^132] The public holiday has no official designation, as "Workers' Day" or otherwise.[^133] In 2005, Labour's [Ruairi Quinn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruairi_Quinn "Ruairi Quinn") condemned an alleged Fianna Fáil proposal to replace the May holiday with one on 24 April commemorating the [1916 Rising](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1916_Rising "1916 Rising") as a slight to workers. The proposal was, in actuality, for an extra holiday – rather than a replacement.[^134]

Traditional 1 May Concert in St. John Lateran square, [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome")

The first International Workers' Day celebration in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") took place in 1890. It started initially as an attempt to celebrate workers' achievements in their struggle for their rights and for better social and economic conditions. It was abolished under the [Fascist regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_under_Fascism_\(1922%E2%80%931943\) "Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)") and immediately restored after the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"). (During the fascist period, a "Holiday of the Italian Labour" (*Festa del lavoro italiano*) was celebrated on 21 April, the date of *[Natale di Roma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natale_di_Roma "Natale di Roma")*, when [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") was allegedly founded.) In 1947, following an unexpected electoral victory of the [Popular Democratic Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Front_\(Italy\) "Popular Democratic Front (Italy)") in [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily"), local secessionists and pro-USA mafia hitmen killed 14 and injured 27 firing machine guns at an International Workers' Day celebration in the [Portella della Ginestra Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre "Portella della Ginestra massacre"). International Workers' Day is now an important celebration in Italy and is a national holiday regardless of what day of the week it falls. The *Concerto del Primo Maggio* ("1st of May Concert"), organized by Italian labour unions in Rome in [Piazza di Porta San Giovanni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porta_San_Giovanni_\(Rome\) "Porta San Giovanni (Rome)") has become an important event in recent years. Every year the concert is attended by a large audience of mostly young people and involves the participation of many famous bands and songwriters, lasting from 15:00 until midnight. The concert is usually broadcast live on [Rai 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_3 "Rai 3").[^135] A second big concert is organised in the city of [Taranto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranto "Taranto") and it is transmitted locally by [TGR Apulia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGR "TGR").

In Lithuania, 1 May is an official public holiday celebrated as International Work Day ([Lithuanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language "Lithuanian language"): *Tarptautinė darbo diena*).[^136] Celebrations for workers' day were mandatory during the [Soviet occupation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states "Occupation of the Baltic states"), and carry a negative connotation as a result today. As Lithuania [declared its independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_the_Re-Establishment_of_the_State_of_Lithuania "Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania") in 1990, Work Day lost its public holiday status, but regained it in 2001.[^137] [^138]

In Latvia, Labour Day is an official public holiday celebrated as Convocation of the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of Latvia, Labour Day.[^139]

In Luxembourg, 1 May, called the *Dag vun der Aarbecht* ("Labour Day"), is a legal holiday traditionally associated with large demonstrations by trade unions in Luxembourg City and other cities.[^140]

In Malta, 1 May is an official public holiday celebrated as "Workers' Day",[^141] together with the [religious feast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_feast "Religious feast") of [Saint Joseph the Worker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph "Saint Joseph"). ([Saint Joseph's Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph%27s_Day "Saint Joseph's Day"), 19 March, the saint's main feast, is also a public holiday in Malta).[^141] A [Labour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(Malta\) "Labour Party (Malta)") mass meeting takes place on 1 May. [Nationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Party_\(Malta\) "Nationalist Party (Malta)") celebrate [accession to the European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union "2004 enlargement of the European Union") on 1 May 2004.

In Montenegro, 1 May is an official public holiday and a day off work and a day out of school. It is the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated.[^142]

In the Netherlands, 1 May or Labour Day ([Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language"): *Dag van de Arbeid*) is not an official holiday. This is due in part to its proximity to the national holiday, [Koningsdag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koningsdag "Koningsdag"), which was celebrated on the day before until 2013. Labour movements also didn't see the need to agitate for an extra day off during the [Post–World War II recovery efforts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion "Post–World War II economic expansion"). [Liberals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism") who joined the [Labour Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(Netherlands\) "Labour Party (Netherlands)") in this same period also wanted to distance themselves from the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") because of [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") sentiments.[^143] A small number of public servants has the day off, as well as bank employees and financial traders as the European banking system is not open that day.

First Workers' Day celebration of the [Ottoman period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") in [Skopje](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje "Skopje"), 1909

In North Macedonia, 1 May ([Macedonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language "Macedonian language"): Ден на Трудот, *Den na Trudot*) is an official public holiday. Before 2007, 2 may was also a public holiday. People celebrate with friends and family at traditional picnics across the country, accompanied by the usual outdoor games, various grilled meats and beverages. Left organizations and some trade unions organize protests on 1 May.[^144]

Norway's then Prime Minister [Jens Stoltenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg") gives his 1 May speech in 2009 in [Oslo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo"), Norway.

In Norway, Labour Day ([Norwegian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"): *Arbeidernes Dag*) is celebrated 1 May and has been an official public holiday since 1947.[^145] It was first introduced by the workers movement in 1890,[^146] and recognized as an official flag day in 1935.[^147] The program for the day is presented by local unions and labour organizations.

[1 May Coal Mine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maja_Coal_Mine "1 Maja Coal Mine") in Wodzisław Śląski, Poland

In Poland, since the fall of communism, 1 May is officially celebrated as [Labour Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Poland "Public holidays in Poland").[^148] [^149] It is customary for labour activists to organize parades in cities and towns across Poland. The holiday is also commonly referred to as "Labour Day" ([Polish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"): *Święto Pracy*).

In Poland, Labour Day is closely followed by [May 3rd Constitution Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_3rd_Constitution_Day "May 3rd Constitution Day"). These two dates combined often result in a [long weekend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_weekend "Long weekend") called *Majówka*, which may last for up to 9 days from 28 April to 6 May, at the cost of taking only 3 days off. People often travel, and *Majówka* is unofficially considered the start of barbecuing season in Poland.

Between these two, on 2 May, there is a patriotic holiday, the Day of the Polish Flag (*[Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzie%C5%84_Flagi_Rzeczypospolitej_Polskiej "pl:Dzień Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej")*), introduced by a parliamentary act of 20 February 2004. The day, however, does not force paid time off.

In Soviet times, streets, places, squares, parks and also factories were frequently named in honor of International Workers' Day, such as [1 Maja Coal Mine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maja_Coal_Mine "1 Maja Coal Mine") in [Wodzisław Śląski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wodzis%C5%82aw_%C5%9Al%C4%85ski "Wodzisław Śląski").

In Portugal, Workers' Day ([Portuguese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"): *Dia do Trabalhador*) on 1 May was suppressed during the [Estado Novo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_Novo_\(Portugal\) "Estado Novo (Portugal)") dictatorship. The first workers' day demonstration was held a week after the [Carnation Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution "Carnation Revolution") of 25 April 1974. It is still the largest demonstration in the history of Portugal. It is used as an opportunity for workers and workers' groups to voice their discontent over working conditions in demonstrations across Portugal, the largest being held in Lisbon. It is an official public holiday.[^150]

Delegates of the Romanian Communist Party on 1 May 1965

In Romania, 1 May, known as the "International Labour Day" ([Romanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language "Romanian language"): *Ziua internațională a muncii*), the "International Workers' Day" (*Ziua internațională a muncitorilor*), or simply "1/First of May" (*1/Întâi Mai*), is an official [public holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Romania "Public holidays in Romania"). During the [communist regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Romania "Communist Romania"), like in all former Eastern Bloc countries, the day was marked by large state-organized parades in most towns and cities. After the [Romanian Revolution of 1989](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution_of_1989 "Romanian Revolution of 1989"), 1 May continues to be an official public holiday, but without any state organized events or parades. Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising [picnics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic "Picnic") and [barbecues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue "Barbecue"). It is also the first day of the year when people, especially those from the southeastern part of the country including the capital [Bucharest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest "Bucharest"), go to spend the day in one of the [Romanian Black Sea resorts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Black_Sea_resorts "Romanian Black Sea resorts").

Russian Communist Workers' Party demonstration on 1 May 2008 in [Izhevsk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izhevsk "Izhevsk")

In [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), the "Day of International Workers Solidarity, the 1st of May" ([Russian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): День международной солидарности трудящихся Первое ма́я) was celebrated illegally in the country until the [February Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution "February Revolution") enabled the first legal celebration in 1917. The following year, after the [Bolshevik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik "Bolshevik") [seizure of power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution"), the International Workers' Day celebrations were boycotted by [Mensheviks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensheviks "Mensheviks"), [Left Socialist Revolutionaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist_Revolutionaries "Left Socialist Revolutionaries") and [anarchists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Russia "Anarchism in Russia"). It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized in [Red Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square "Red Square"), where the [General Secretary of the CPSU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_CPSU "General Secretary of the CPSU") and other party and government leaders stood atop [Lenin's Mausoleum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_Mausoleum "Lenin's Mausoleum") and waved to the crowds. Until 1969, the holiday was marked by [military parades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade") throughout the [Russian SFSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_SFSR "Russian SFSR") and the union republics. The following was the order of the march past:

- [Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Band_Service_of_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Soviet_Union "Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union") (parade finale)

The first of these parades were held [1918](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_May_1_Parade "1918 May 1 Parade"), when [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") presided over a ceremony at [Khodynka Field](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khodynka_Field "Khodynka Field").[^152] Notable parades included the parade of 1941 (which saw the presence of a [Wehrmacht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht "Wehrmacht") delegation led by [Ernst August Köstring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_August_K%C3%B6string "Ernst August Köstring") [^153]) and 1963 (where Cuban leader [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro") was a guest). The only parades on 1 May to be cancelled were the parades scheduled during the years of the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") and the 1965 parade (this was cancelled to make way for the [1965 Moscow Victory Day Parade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_Moscow_Victory_Day_Parade "1965 Moscow Victory Day Parade") nine days later). In 1979, ten years after the last annual parade, a brief [exhibition drill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_drill "Exhibition drill") and [military tattoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tattoo "Military tattoo") of the forces of the Moscow Garrison took place.[^154]

In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, International Workers' Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as "a rally of communist-oriented organisations" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, [Viktor Anpilov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Anpilov "Viktor Anpilov"), "for early dismissal of President [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin"), ousting [Moscow Mayor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Mayor "Moscow Mayor") [Gavriil Popov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavriil_Kharitonovich_Popov "Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov") from power and putting the latter on trial". Since 1992, International Workers' Day is officially called "Spring and Labor Day", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.

In 1993, a Moscow Labor Day rally followed by a procession organized by the [National Salvation Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Salvation_Front_\(Russia\) "National Salvation Front (Russia)"), Labor Moscow, and the [Communist Party of the Russian Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Russian_Federation "Communist Party of the Russian Federation") turned into clashes between demonstrators and riot police near houses 30 and 37 along [Leninsky Avenue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninsky_Avenue,_Moscow "Leninsky Avenue, Moscow").[^155] [^4]

After the demonstrators broke through the cordon, OMON went on a counterattack near house 37 along Leninsky Avenue. "The demonstrators fought fiercely using banner poles." To overcome the barriers, the demonstrators used trucks as rams. One of the rams resulted in severe injuries to OMON Sergeant Vladimir Tolokneyev, who died four days later. Media reports on the number of victims varied: the initial figure of 150 people soon quadrupled.[^155]

1 May is celebrated annually by communists, anarchists, and other organizations as the Day of International Solidarity of Workers. These events are accompanied by the promotion of sharp social and political slogans ("Government of bankrupts - resign!", "WE do not want to pay for YOUR crisis!", "Self-organization! Self-government! Self-defense!" etc.).[^156] [^157]

The Spring and Labor Day, celebrated as a state holiday, is usually used for political actions under independent slogans by trade unions, parties, and movements of various orientations, from the left to the far right: [United Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Russia "United Russia") (together with the [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Independent_Trade_Unions_of_Russia "Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia") and the [Young Guard of United Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Guard_of_United_Russia "Young Guard of United Russia")), [A Just Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Just_Russia "A Just Russia"), the [Communist Party of the Russian Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Russian_Federation "Communist Party of the Russian Federation"), [Yabloko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yabloko "Yabloko"), [Solidarnost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarnost "Solidarnost"), the [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_of_Russia "Liberal Democratic Party of Russia"), and [Autonomous Action](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Action "Autonomous Action").[^158] [^159]

The slogans of official events organized by the authorities are far from the historical roots of the Labour Day demonstrations: "Putin's plan is a plan for Victory!", "Bonuses for pensioners", "Three kids in a family is the norm!".[^160]

A more radical attitude to the holiday in 2009 was expressed by the head of the metropolitan branch of the [Right Cause](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Cause "Right Cause") party, Igor Trunov: "To be honest, I didn't really want to celebrate 1 May, because I don't stand in solidarity with the workers of Chicago, where this holiday came from".[^161]

On 1 May 2013, several hundred thousand workers took to the streets of Russian cities. More than 100,000 people took part in the Labour Day demonstration in Moscow.[^162]

Since 2014 a national civil parade has been held on 1 May on Red Square, with similar events held in major cities and regional capitals.

In 2016, the celebration of Easter and Labour Day overlapped,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-%D0%A0%D0%98%D0%90_010516-163"><span>[</span>159<span>]</span></a></sup> which led to the abandonment of Labour Day events in some regions.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-%D0%AD%D1%85%D0%BE_210416-164"><span>[</span>160<span>]</span></a></sup>

In Serbia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition 1 May is celebrated by countryside picnics and outdoor barbecues. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia. In [Belgrade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade "Belgrade"), the capital, most people go to [Avala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avala "Avala") or [Košutnjak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C5%A1utnjak "Košutnjak"), which are parks located in Rakovica and Čukarica. People go around the country to enjoy nature. A major religious holiday of [Djurdjevdan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djurdjevdan "Djurdjevdan") is on 6 May so quite often days off work are given to connect these two holidays and weekend, creating a small spring break. 1 May is celebrated by most of the population regardless of political views.

In Slovakia, 1 May is an official holiday. Celebrations are held surrounding workers' day but are also connected with the commemoration of the [entry of the Slovak Republic into the European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union "2004 enlargement of the European Union") (1 May 2004).[^165]

In Slovenia, 1 May and 2 May are public holidays. There are many official events all over the country to celebrate workers' day. In [Ljubljana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana "Ljubljana"), the capital, the main celebration is held on [Rožnik Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro%C5%BEnik_\(hill\) "Rožnik (hill)") in the city. On the night of 30 April, bonfires are traditionally burned.[^166]

Labor Day rally in [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"), Spain

In Spain, the first Workers' Day (*Día del Trabajador*) was celebrated in 1889 but only became a public holiday with the beginning of the [Spanish Second Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Second_Republic "Spanish Second Republic") in 1931. It was banned afterwards by the [Franco regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francoist_Spain "Francoist Spain") in 1937.[^167] The year after it was decreed that the "Fiesta de la Exaltación del Trabajo," or Labor Festival, be held on 18 July, the anniversary of the [Francoist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_faction_\(Spanish_Civil_War\) "Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)") [military coup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_coup_of_July_1936 "Spanish coup of July 1936"), instead.[^168] After the death of [Francisco Franco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco "Francisco Franco") in 1975 and the move towards democracy, the first large rallies on 1 May began again in 1977. It was re-introduced as a public holiday in 1978.[^169] Commonly, peaceful demonstrations and parades occur in major and minor cities.[^170] [^171]

[Swedish Social Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Social_Democratic_Party "Swedish Social Democratic Party") at International Workers' Day demonstration in [Stockholm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm "Stockholm"), [Sweden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), in 2006. The party has dominated Swedish politics for nearly a century. The [trade union palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Trade_Union_Confederation "Swedish Trade Union Confederation") in Stockholm is seen at the end of the picture.

1 May has been an important part of Swedish history since the late 19th century. The day was made a [public holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday "Public holiday") in 1938 but had been celebrated by the [Swedish Social Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Social_Democratic_Party "Swedish Social Democratic Party") and the [left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4nsterpartiet "Vänsterpartiet") since 1890. The first International Workers' Day celebration gathered more than 50,000 people in central Stockholm. The crowd went to hear speeches by the leading figures in the [Swedish labour movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_labour_movement "Swedish labour movement") such as [Hjalmar Branting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Branting "Hjalmar Branting") (later [prime minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister "Prime minister")), [August Palm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Palm "August Palm") and [Hinke Bergegren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinke_Bergegren "Hinke Bergegren"). During [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") the demonstrations mainly had a peace message and the [Liberal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_People%27s_Party_\(Sweden\) "Liberal People's Party (Sweden)") also joined the demonstrations. The [eight-hour working day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-hour_working_day "8-hour working day") and [women's suffrage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage "Women's suffrage") were the principal themes during the troubled times after World War I.

Istanbul May Day clashes in 2013

Workers marching to [Taksim Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square "Taksim Square"), 1 May 2012

1 May is an official holiday celebrated in Turkey. It was a holiday as "Spring Day" until 1981 when it was canceled after the [1980 coup d'état](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1980 Turkish coup d'état"). In 2009, the Turkish government restored the holiday after some casualties and demonstrations. [Taksim Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square "Taksim Square") is the centre of the celebrations due to the [Taksim Square massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square_massacre "Taksim Square massacre").

Workers' Day was first celebrated in 1912 in [Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul") and in 1899 in [İzmir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0zmir "İzmir"). After the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the celebrations continued. In 1924, it was forbidden by a decree of the [Kemalist government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk") in both 1924 and 1925, demonstrations were intervened by arm floats. In 1935, The National Assembly declared 1 May as "Spring Day" to be a public holiday.[^179]

During the events leading to the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, a massacre occurred on 1 May 1977 (Taksim Square massacre), in which unknown people ([agents provocateurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur "Agent provocateur")) opened fire on the crowd. The crowd was the biggest in Turkish workers' history with the number of people approximating 500,000. In the next two years, provocations and confusion continued and peaked before the 1980 coup d'état. The 1 May holiday was cancelled after the coup d'état. Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces. Thus, 1 May 1996 has been remembered by workers' movements.[^179]

In 2007, the 30th anniversary of the Taksim Square Massacre, leftist workers' unions wanted to commemorate the massacre in [Taksim Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square "Taksim Square"). Since the government would not let them into the square, 580–700 people were stopped and 1 person died under police control. After these events, the government declared 1 May as "Work and Solidarity Day" but not as a holiday. In the next year, the day was declared as a holiday, but people were still not allowed to gather in Taksim Square.[^180] The year 2008 was remembered with police violence in Istanbul. Police fired tear gas grenades among the crowds, and into hospitals and a primary school. Workers pushed forward so that in 2010, 140,000 people gathered in Taksim, and in 2011 there were more than half a million demonstrators.

After three years of peaceful meetings in 2013, meetings in Taksim Square were forbidden by the government. Clashes occurred between police and workers; [water cannon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cannon "Water cannon") and [tear gas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas "Tear gas") have been widely used.[^181]

During the 1990s businesses began to treat it like a regular working day as the number of Labour Day-related activities decreased.[^223] 1 May is largely celebrated by the [former Soviet Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Soviet_Union "History of the Jews in the Soviet Union") who [immigrated to Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_post-Soviet_aliyah "1990s post-Soviet aliyah") in the 1990s.

[^4]: The clashes were preceded by two circumstances: "the organizers deviated from the route allowed by the mayor's office," and the Moscow authorities decided to "obstruct the movement of the column along Leninsky Avenue." Subsequently, the authorities failed to rationally justify such a decision: the movement took place in the direction *from* the city center. The version that "the demonstrators are going to smash Gorbachev's dacha" remained unconfirmed.  
The demonstrators, who were moving along Leninsky Avenue from Oktyabrskaya Square, noticing the truck barriers, as well as the cordon of police officers and OMON, reorganized, putting forward a vanguard of 500–600 people, the most organized part of which was the squad of the National Salvation Front. A few tens of meters before the cordon, the column stepped up and almost immediately broke through the cordon.
