Will Brics nations pose a real challenge to Donald Trump’s second term in office? And how do Trump’s tariffs stack up against this rising bloc?  
  
US economist Richard D. Wolff joined us for an extended conversation on Trump, tariffs Brics, as well as the US plan to ‘take over’ Gaza.  
  
“This is difficult here in the US for people to hear, but it’s the truth. The American empire is declining,” argues Wolff who claims that the Brics coalition (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) will have an economic edge over the US.
