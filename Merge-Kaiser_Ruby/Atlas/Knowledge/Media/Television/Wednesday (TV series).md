Filming took place in [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania") between September 2021 and March 2022.

*Wednesday* premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on November 23 to positive reviews from critics; Ortega's performance received critical acclaim.[^5] Within three weeks of release, it became the second- [most watched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_Netflix_original_programming "List of most-watched Netflix original programming") English-language Netflix series.

## Premise

[Wednesday Addams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday_Addams "Wednesday Addams") is expelled from her school after dumping live [piranhas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranhas "Piranhas") into the school's pool in retaliation for the boys' [water polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo "Water polo") team bullying her brother [Pugsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugsley_Addams "Pugsley Addams"). Consequently, her parents [Gomez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomez_Addams "Gomez Addams") and [Morticia Addams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morticia_Addams "Morticia Addams") transfer her to their high school alma mater Nevermore Academy, a private school for monstrous outcasts, in the town of [Jericho, Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho,_Vermont "Jericho, Vermont"). Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal Larissa Weems. However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's [psychic abilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_abilities "Psychic abilities"), which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.

In the second season, Wednesday returns to Nevermore and while developing her psychic abilities she must face a new tormentor and prevent Enid's death.
