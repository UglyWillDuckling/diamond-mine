**James Watt** [FRS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society "Fellow of the Royal Society") [FRSE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh "Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh") ([/ w ɒ t /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); 30 January 1736 (19 January 1736 [OS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates")) – 25 August 1819) [^1] was a Scottish inventor, engineer and chemist who improved on [Thomas Newcomen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen "Thomas Newcomen") 's 1712 [Newcomen steam engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_steam_engine "Newcomen steam engine") with his [Watt steam engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine "Watt steam engine") in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world.

While working as an instrument maker at the [University of Glasgow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow "University of Glasgow"), Watt became interested in the technology of [steam engines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine"). At the time engineers such as [John Smeaton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smeaton "John Smeaton") were aware of the inefficiencies of Newcomen's engine and aimed to improve it.[^3] Watt's insight was to realise that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the [cylinder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_\(engine\) "Cylinder (engine)"). Watt introduced a design enhancement, the [separate condenser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine#Separate_condenser "Watt steam engine"), which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Eventually, he [adapted his engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotative_beam_engine "Rotative beam engine") to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.

Watt attempted to commercialise his invention, but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with [Matthew Boulton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Boulton "Matthew Boulton") in 1775. The new firm of [Boulton and Watt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt "Boulton and Watt") was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man. In his retirement, Watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work.

As Watt developed the concept of [horsepower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower "Horsepower"),[^4] the [SI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") unit of power, the [watt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt"), was named after him.

## Biography

James Watt was born on 19 January 1736 in [Greenock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenock "Greenock"), [Renfrewshire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfrewshire_\(historic\) "Renfrewshire (historic)"), the eldest of the five surviving children of Agnes Muirhead (1703–1755) and James Watt (1698–1782).[^5] Watt was baptised on 25 January 1736 at [Old West Kirk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_West_Kirk "Old West Kirk"), in Greenock.[^6] His mother came from a distinguished family, was well educated and said to be of forceful character, while his father was a [shipwright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwright "Shipwright"), ship owner and contractor, and served as the Greenock's [chief baillie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie "Baillie") in 1751.[^5] [^7] The Watt family's wealth came in part from Watt's father's trading in slaves and slave-produced goods.[^8] Watt's parents were [Presbyterians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian "Presbyterian") and strong [Covenanters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenanters "Covenanters"),[^9] but despite his religious upbringing he later became a [deist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deist "Deist").[^10] [^11] Watt's grandfather, Thomas Watt (1642–1734), was a teacher of mathematics, surveying and navigation [^5] and [baillie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie "Baillie") to the [Baron of Cartsburn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_of_Cartsburn "Baron of Cartsburn").[^12]

Initially, Watt was [educated at home](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling "Homeschooling") by his mother, later going on to attend Greenock Grammar School. There he exhibited an aptitude for [mathematics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), while [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") failed to interest him.

Watt is said to have suffered prolonged bouts of ill-health as a child and from frequent headaches all his life.[^5] [^13]

After leaving school, Watt worked in the workshops of his father's businesses, demonstrating considerable dexterity and skill in creating engineering models. After his father suffered unsuccessful business ventures, Watt left Greenock to seek employment in [Glasgow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow "Glasgow") as a [mathematical instrument maker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument "Measuring instrument").[^5]

James Watt by [John Partridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Partridge_\(artist\) "John Partridge (artist)"), after Sir [William Beechey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Beechey "William Beechey") (1806) [^14] [^15]

Bust of Watt in the [Scottish National Portrait Gallery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Portrait_Gallery "Scottish National Portrait Gallery")

When he was 18, Watt's mother died and his father's health began to fail. Watt travelled to [London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") and was able to obtain a period of training as an instrument maker for a year (1755–56), then returned to Scotland, settling in the major commercial city of [Glasgow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow "Glasgow"), intent on setting up his own instrument-making business. He was still very young and, having not had a full [apprenticeship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship "Apprenticeship"), did not have the usual connections via a former master to establish himself as a [journeyman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman "Journeyman") instrument maker.

Watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from Jamaica of [astronomical instruments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronomical_instruments "List of astronomical instruments") bequeathed by [Alexander MacFarlane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_MacFarlane_\(judge\) "Alexander MacFarlane (judge)") to the [University of Glasgow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow "University of Glasgow") – instruments that required expert attention.[^16] Watt restored them to working order and was [remunerated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remuneration "Remuneration"). These instruments were eventually installed in the [Macfarlane Observatory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macfarlane_Observatory "Macfarlane Observatory"). Subsequently, three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university. It was initiated in 1757 and two of the professors, the [physicist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist") and [chemist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemist "Chemist") [Joseph Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black "Joseph Black") as well as the famed economist [Adam Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith"), became Watt's friends.[^17]

At first, he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university, helping with demonstrations, and expanding the production of [quadrants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_\(instrument\) "Quadrant (instrument)"). He made and repaired brass [reflecting quadrants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octant_\(instrument\) "Octant (instrument)"), [parallel rulers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_rulers "Parallel rulers"), [scales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale "Weighing scale"), parts for [telescopes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope"), and [barometers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer"), among other things.

Biographers such as [Samuel Smiles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Smiles "Samuel Smiles") assert that Watt struggled to establish himself in Glasgow due to opposition from the [Trades House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_House "Trades House"), but this has been disputed by other historians, such as [Harry Lumsden](https://archive.org/details/historyofhammerm00lums/page/n8 "iarchive:historyofhammerm00lums/page/n8"). The records from this period are fragmentary, but while it is clear that Watt encountered opposition, he was nevertheless able to work and trade as a skilled [metal worker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking "Metalworking"), suggesting that the [Incorporation of Hammermen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporated_Trades_of_Edinburgh "Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh") were satisfied that he met their requirements for membership, or that Watt managed to avoid their outright opposition.[^18]

In 1759, he formed a partnership with John Craig, an architect and businessman, to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys. This partnership lasted for the next six years, and employed up to 16 workers. Craig died in 1765. One employee, Alex Gardner, eventually took over the business, which lasted into the 20th century.[^19]

In 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret (Peggy) Miller, with whom he had 5 children, 2 of whom lived to adulthood: [James Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt_Jr. "James Watt Jr.") (1769–1848) and Margaret (1767–1796). His wife died in childbirth in 1773. In 1777, he married again, to Ann MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow [dye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye "Dye") -maker, with whom he had 2 children: Gregory (1777–1804), who became a geologist and mineralogist,[^20] and Janet (1779–1794). Ann died in 1832.[^21] Between 1777 and 1790 he lived in Regent Place, [Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham").

There is a popular story that Watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling, the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing Watt the power of steam. This story is told in many forms; in some Watt is a young lad, in others he is older, sometimes it's his mother's kettle, sometimes his aunt's, suggesting that it may be apocryphal. In any event, Watt did not *invent* the steam engine, but significantly *improved the efficiency* of the existing [Newcomen engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_atmospheric_engine "Newcomen atmospheric engine") by adding a [separate condenser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine#Separate_condenser "Watt steam engine"), consistent with the now-familiar principles of [thermal efficiency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency "Thermal efficiency"). The story was possibly created by Watt's son, [James Watt, Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt_junior "James Watt junior"), who was determined to preserve and embellish his father's legacy.[^22] In this light, it can be seen as akin to the story of [Isaac Newton and the falling apple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#Apple_incident "Isaac Newton") and his discovery of [gravity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").

Although likely a myth, the story of Watt and the kettle has a basis in fact. In trying to understand the [thermodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") of heat and steam, James Watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these, he used a kettle as a [boiler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler "Boiler") to generate steam.[^23]

[James Eckford Lauder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eckford_Lauder "James Eckford Lauder"): *James Watt and the Steam Engine: the Dawn of the Nineteenth Century*, 1855

[Original condenser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt%27s_separate_condenser "Watt's separate condenser") by Watt ([Science Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Museum_\(London\) "Science Museum (London)"))

In 1759 Watt's friend [John Robison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robison_\(physicist\) "John Robison (physicist)") called his attention to the use of steam as a source of [motive power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_\(physics\) "Power (physics)").[^24] The design of the Newcomen engine, in use for almost 50 years for pumping water from mines, had hardly changed from its first implementation. Watt began to experiment with steam, though he had never seen an operating steam engine. He tried constructing a model; it failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject. He came to realise the importance of [latent heat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat "Latent heat") —the [thermal energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy "Thermal energy") released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process—in understanding the engine, which, unknown to Watt, his friend [Joseph Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black "Joseph Black") had previously discovered years before. Understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state, for the science of [thermodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") would not be formalised for nearly another 100 years.

In 1763, Watt was asked to repair a model Newcomen engine belonging to the university.[^24] Even after repair, the engine barely worked. After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that about three-quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the [engine cylinder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_\(engine\) "Cylinder (engine)") on every cycle.[^25] This energy was wasted because, later in the cycle, cold water was injected into the cylinder to [condense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condense "Condense") the steam to reduce its pressure. Thus, by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder, the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into [mechanical energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy "Mechanical energy").

Watt's critical insight, arrived at in May 1765 as he crossed [Glasgow Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Green "Glasgow Green") park,[^26] was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the [piston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston "Piston"), and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a "steam jacket".[^25] Thus, very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle, making more available to perform useful work. Watt had a working model later that same year.

Despite a potentially workable design, there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a full-scale engine. This required more [capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capital "Financial capital"), some of which came from Black. More substantial backing came from [John Roebuck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roebuck "John Roebuck"), the founder of the celebrated [Carron Iron Works](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carron_Iron_Works "Carron Iron Works") near [Falkirk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkirk "Falkirk"), with whom he now formed a partnership. Roebuck lived at [Kinneil House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinneil_House "Kinneil House") in [Bo'ness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%27ness "Bo'ness"), during which time Watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house.[^28] The shell of the cottage, and a very large part of one of his projects, still exist to the rear.[^29]

The principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder. [Iron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_\(material\) "Iron (material)") workers of the day were more like [blacksmiths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith "Blacksmith") than modern [machinists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinist "Machinist"), and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision. Much capital was spent in pursuing a [patent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent") on Watt's invention. Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment—first as a [surveyor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveyor_\(surveying\) "Surveyor (surveying)"), then as a [civil engineer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineer "Civil engineer") —for 8 years.[^30]

Roebuck went [bankrupt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_Kingdom "Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom"), and [Matthew Boulton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Boulton "Matthew Boulton"), who owned the [Soho Manufactory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho_Manufactory "Soho Manufactory") works near [Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"), acquired his patent rights. An [extension](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_extensions "Patent extensions") of the patent to 1800 was successfully obtained in 1775.[^2]

Through Boulton, Watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world. The difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by [John Wilkinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkinson_\(industrialist\) "John Wilkinson (industrialist)"), who had developed precision boring techniques for [cannon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon "Cannon") making at [Bersham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bersham_Ironworks "Bersham Ironworks"), near [Wrexham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham "Wrexham"), [North Wales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales "North Wales"). Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership, [Boulton and Watt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt "Boulton and Watt"), which lasted for the next 25 years.

### First engines

Engraving of a 1784 [steam engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine "Watt steam engine") designed by [Boulton and Watt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt "Boulton and Watt")

In 1776, the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises. These first engines were used to power pumps and produced only [reciprocating motion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocating_motion "Reciprocating motion") to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft. The design was commercially successful, and for the next five years, Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in [Cornwall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall "Cornwall"), for pumping water out of mines.

These early engines were not manufactured by Boulton and Watt, but were made by others according to drawings made by Watt, who served in the role of [consulting engineer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulting_engineer "Consulting engineer"). The erection of the engine and its [shakedown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakedown_\(testing\) "Shakedown (testing)") was supervised by Watt, at first, and then by men in the firm's employ, with the actual work being accomplished by the purchaser of the engine. Supervising erectors included at various times [William Murdoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Murdoch "William Murdoch"), [John Rennie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rennie_the_Elder "John Rennie the Elder"), [William Playfair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair "William Playfair"), [John Southern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Southern_\(engineer\) "John Southern (engineer)"), [Logan Henderson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Henderson_\(engineer\) "Logan Henderson (engineer)"), [James Lawson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Lawson_\(engineer\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "James Lawson (engineer) (page does not exist)"), [William Brunton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brunton "William Brunton"), [Isaac Perrins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Perrins "Isaac Perrins"), and others.

These were large machines. The first, for example, had a cylinder with a diameter of 50 inches and an overall height of about 24 feet, and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it. Boulton and Watt charged an annual payment, equal to one-third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a Newcomen engine performing the same work.

The field of application for the invention was greatly widened when Boulton urged Watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce [rotational power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy "Rotational energy") for grinding, weaving and milling. Although a [crank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_\(mechanism\) "Crank (mechanism)") seemed the obvious solution to the conversion, Watt and Boulton were stymied by a patent for this, whose holder, [James Pickard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pickard "James Pickard") and his associates proposed to cross-license the external condenser. Watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their [sun and planet gear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_and_planet_gear "Sun and planet gear") in 1781.

Over the next six years, he made other improvements and modifications to the steam engine. A double-acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on both sides of the piston, was one. He described methods for working the steam "expansively" (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A [compound engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_engine "Compound engine"), which connected two or more engines, was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam [indicator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_diagram "Indicator diagram") which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a [trade secret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret "Trade secret"). Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the [parallel motion linkage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_motion "Parallel motion"), which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a [circular arc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc "Circular arc"). This was patented in 1784. A [throttle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttle "Throttle") valve to control the power of the engine, and a [centrifugal governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor "Centrifugal governor"), patented in 1788,[^31] to keep it from "running away" were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as [fuel efficient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency "Fuel efficiency") as the Newcomen engine.

Because of the danger of exploding boilers, which were in a very primitive stage of development, and the ongoing issues with leaks, Watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure.

### Patent trials

A steam engine built to James Watt's patent in 1848 at [Freiberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiberg,_Saxony "Freiberg, Saxony") in Germany

[Edward Bull](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bull "Edward Bull") started constructing engines for Boulton and Watt in Cornwall in 1781. By 1792, he had started making engines of his own design, but which contained a separate condenser, and so infringed Watt's patents. Two brothers, [Jabez Carter Hornblower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabez_Carter_Hornblower "Jabez Carter Hornblower") and [Jonathan Hornblower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Hornblower "Jonathan Hornblower") Jnr also started to build engines about the same time. Others began to modify Newcomen engines by adding a condenser, and the mine owners in Cornwall became convinced that Watt's patent could not be enforced. They started to withhold payments to Boulton and Watt, which by 1795 had fallen on hard times. Of the total £21,000 (equivalent to £2,740,000 as of 2023) owed, only £2,500 had been received. Watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims.[^32]

He first sued Bull in 1793. The jury found for Watt, but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial. In the meantime, injunctions were issued against the [infringers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_infringement "Patent infringement"), forcing their payments of the [royalties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment "Royalty payment") to be placed in [escrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow "Escrow"). The trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive, but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers, except for Jonathan Hornblower, all began to settle their cases. Hornblower was soon brought to trial in 1799, and the verdict of the four was decisively in favour of Watt. Their friend John Wilkinson, who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder, was a particularly grievous case. He had erected about 20 engines without Boulton's and Watts' knowledge. They finally agreed to settle the infringement in 1796.[^33] Boulton and Watt never collected all that was owed them, but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through [arbitration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration "Arbitration"). These trials were extremely costly in both money and time, but ultimately were successful for the firm.

### Copying machine

Portable Copying Machine by James Watt & Co. c. 1795

Before 1780, there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings. The only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using multiple linked pens. Watt at first experimented with improving this method, but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome. He instead decided to try to physically transfer ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet, moistened with a solvent, and pressed to the original. The second sheet had to be thin, so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light, thus reproducing the original exactly.[^34] [^35]

Watt started to develop the process in 1779, and made many experiments to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer. All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later. Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and [James Keir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Keir "James Keir") (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co. The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years. Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794.[^36] It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the 20th century.

### Chemical experiments

From an early age, Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by [Claude Louis Berthollet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Louis_Berthollet "Claude Louis Berthollet") in which he reacted [hydrochloric acid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid "Hydrochloric acid") with [manganese dioxide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_dioxide "Manganese dioxide") to produce [chlorine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine "Chlorine"). He had already found that an [aqueous solution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution "Aqueous solution") of chlorine could [bleach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach "Bleach") textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and [sulphuric acid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphuric_acid "Sulphuric acid") could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of [alkali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali "Alkali"), and obtained a [turbid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity "Turbidity") solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise, he tried to keep his method a secret.[^37]

With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1,500 yards (4,500 feet) of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time, Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it, so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when [Charles Tennant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Tennant "Charles Tennant") patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder ([calcium hypochlorite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite "Calcium hypochlorite")) that it became a commercial success.

By 1794, Watt had been chosen by [Thomas Beddoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Beddoes "Thomas Beddoes") to manufacture apparatuses to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new [Pneumatic Institution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_Institution "Pneumatic Institution") at [Hotwells](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotwells "Hotwells") in [Bristol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol "Bristol"). Watt continued to experiment with various gases, but by 1797, the medical uses for the " [factitious airs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_airs "Factitious airs") " (artificial gases) had come to a dead end.[^38]

Scientific apparatus designed by [Boulton and Watt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt "Boulton and Watt") in preparation of the [Pneumatic Institution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_Institution "Pneumatic Institution") in Bristol

### Personality

Watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically. The chemist [Humphry Davy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy "Humphry Davy") said of him, "Those who consider James Watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character; he was equally distinguished as a [natural philosopher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosopher "Natural philosopher") and a chemist, and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences, and that peculiar characteristic of genius, the union of them for practical application".[^39]

He was greatly respected by other prominent men of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution").[^40] He was an important member of the [Lunar Society of Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_of_Birmingham "Lunar Society of Birmingham"), and was a much sought-after conversationalist and companion, always interested in expanding his horizons.[^41] His personal relationships with his friends and business partners were always congenial and long-lasting.

According to Lord Liverpool (Prime Minister of the UK),[^42]

> A more excllent and amikable man in all the relations of life I believe never existed.

Watt was a prolific correspondent. During his years in [Cornwall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall "Cornwall"), he wrote long letters to Boulton several times per week. He was averse to publishing his results in, for example, the *[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society")* however, and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in [patents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patents "Patents").[^43] He was an excellent [draughtsman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafter "Drafter").

James Watt's letters from the [Science Museum Library & Archives in Wroughton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Museum_at_Wroughton "Science Museum at Wroughton"), near Swindon

He was a rather poor businessman, and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine. In a letter to [William Small](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Small "William Small") in 1772, Watt confessed that "he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain." [^44] Until he retired, he was always very concerned about his financial affairs, and was something of a worrier. His health was often poor and he suffered frequent nervous headaches and depression. When he retired in 1800, he became a rich enough man to pass the business on to his sons.

### Soho Foundry

At first, the partnership made the drawings and specifications for the engines, and supervised the work to erect them on the customers' property. They produced almost none of the parts themselves. Watt did most of his work at his home in Harper's Hill in Birmingham, while Boulton worked at the [Soho Manufactory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho_Manufactory "Soho Manufactory"). Gradually, the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts, and by 1795, they purchased a property about a mile away from the Soho Manufactory, on the banks of the [Birmingham Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCN_Main_Line "BCN Main Line"), to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines. The [Soho Foundry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho_Foundry "Soho Foundry") formally opened in 1796 at a time when Watt's sons, Gregory and James Jr. were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise. In 1800, the year of Watt's retirement, the firm made a total of 41 engines.[^45]

### Later years

An 1835 painting of " [Heathfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathfield_Hall "Heathfield Hall") ", Watt's house in [Handsworth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsworth,_West_Midlands "Handsworth, West Midlands"), by [Allen Edward Everitt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Edward_Everitt "Allen Edward Everitt")

James Watt's workshop

Watt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with Boulton expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men's sons, [Matthew Robinson Boulton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Robinson_Boulton "Matthew Robinson Boulton") and [James Watt, Junior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt_junior "James Watt junior"). The long-time firm engineer [William Murdoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Murdoch "William Murdoch") was soon made a partner and the firm prospered.

Watt continued to invent other things before and during his semi-retirement. Within his home in [Handsworth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsworth,_West_Midlands "Handsworth, West Midlands"), Staffordshire, Watt made use of a [garret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garret "Garret") room as a workshop, and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions.[^46] Among other things, he invented and constructed machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well, but which he never patented.[^47] One of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small [head](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_\(sculpture\) "Bust (sculpture)") of his old professor friend [Adam Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith"). He maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects. He proposed, for example, a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the [River Clyde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Clyde "River Clyde") at Glasgow.[^48]

He and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in mid-Wales at Doldowlod House, one mile south of [Llanwrthwl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanwrthwl "Llanwrthwl"), which he much improved.

In 1816, he took a trip on the [paddle-steamer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_steamer "Paddle steamer") *[Comet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS_Comet "PS Comet")*, a product of his inventions, to revisit his home town of Greenock.[^49]

He died on 25 August 1819 at his home " [Heathfield Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathfield_Hall "Heathfield Hall") " near Handsworth in Staffordshire (now part of Birmingham) at the age of 83.[^50] [^51] He was buried on 2 September in the graveyard of [St Mary's Church, Handsworth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Church,_Handsworth "St Mary's Church, Handsworth").[^52] The church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church.

## Family

On 14 July 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret Miller (d. 1773).[^6] They had two children, Margaret (1767–1796) and James (1769–1848). In 1791, their daughter married James Miller. In September 1773, while Watt was working in the [Scottish Highlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands "Scottish Highlands"), he learned that his wife, who was pregnant with their third child, was seriously ill. He immediately returned home but found that she had died and their child was [stillborn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillborn "Stillborn").[^5] [^53]

On 29 July 1776, he married Ann MacGregor (d. 1832).[^6] [^53]

## Freemasonry

He was Initiated into [Scottish Freemasonry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry_in_Scotland "Freemasonry in Scotland") in The Glasgow Royal Arch Lodge, No. 77, in 1763. The Lodge ceased to exist in 1810. A [Masonic Lodge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_Lodge "Masonic Lodge") was named after him in his home town of Glasgow – Lodge James Watt, No. 1215.[^54]

William Murdoch joined Boulton and Watt in 1777. At first, he worked in the [pattern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_\(casting\) "Pattern (casting)") shop in Soho, but soon he was erecting engines in Cornwall. He became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success including important inventions of his own.

John Griffiths, who wrote a biography [^55] of him in 1992, has argued that Watt's discouragement of Murdoch's work with high-pressure steam on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development: Watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe at higher pressures.[^56]

Watt patented the application of the [sun and planet gear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_and_planet_gear "Sun and planet gear") to steam in 1781 and a [steam locomotive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive "Steam locomotive") in 1784, both of which have strong claims to have been invented by Murdoch.[^57] The patent was never contested by Murdoch, however, and Boulton and Watt's firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their [rotative engines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotative_engine "Rotative engine"), even long after the patent for the crank expired in 1794. Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76.

## Legacy

A preserved [Watt beam engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine "Watt steam engine") at [Loughborough University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University "Loughborough University")

As one author states, Watt's improvements to the steam engine "converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the Industrial Revolution".[^58]

## Honours

Watt was much honoured in his own time. In 1784, he was made a fellow of the [Royal Society of Edinburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh "Royal Society of Edinburgh"), and was elected as a member of the [Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Society_for_Experimental_Philosophy "Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy"), of [Rotterdam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam "Rotterdam"), the Netherlands, in 1787. In 1789, he was elected to the elite group, the [Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeatonian_Society_of_Civil_Engineers "Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers").[^59] In 1806, he was conferred the honorary [Doctor of Laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Law "Doctor of Law") by the [University of Glasgow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow "University of Glasgow"). The [French Academy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy "French Academy") elected him a Corresponding Member and he was made a Foreign Associate in 1814.[^60]

The [watt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") is named after James Watt for his contributions to the development of the [steam engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine"), and was adopted by the Second Congress of the [British Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Science_Association "British Science Association") in 1889 and by the 11th [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") in 1960 as the unit of [power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_\(physics\) "Power (physics)") incorporated in the [International System of Units](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (or "SI").

On 29 May 2009, the [Bank of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") announced that Boulton and Watt would appear on a new [£50 note](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling#Historical_figures "Banknotes of the pound sterling"). The design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a Bank of England note, and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of Watt's steam engine and Boulton's Soho Manufactory. Quotations attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note: "I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—POWER" (Boulton) and "I can think of nothing else but this machine" (Watt). The inclusion of Watt is the second time that a Scot has featured on a Bank of England note (the first was [Adam Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") on the 2007 issue £20 note).[^61] In September 2011, it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on 2 November.[^62]

In 2011, he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the [Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Engineering_Hall_of_Fame "Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame").[^63]

## Memorials

The [James Watt Memorial College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt_College "James Watt College") in [Greenock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenock "Greenock")

Watt was buried in the grounds of [St. Mary's Church, Handsworth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Church,_Handsworth "St. Mary's Church, Handsworth"), in Birmingham. Later expansion of the church, over his grave, means that his tomb is now buried *inside* the church.[^64]

The [garret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic "Attic") room workshop that Watt used in his retirement was left, locked and untouched, until 1853, when it was first viewed by his biographer [J. P. Muirhead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Patrick_Muirhead "James Patrick Muirhead"). Thereafter, it was occasionally visited, but left untouched, as a kind of shrine. A proposal to have it transferred to the [Patent Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Property_Office_\(United_Kingdom\) "Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)") came to nothing. When the house was due to be demolished in 1924, the room and all its contents were presented to the [Science Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Museum_\(London\) "Science Museum (London)"), where it was recreated in its entirety.[^65] It remained on display for visitors for many years, but was walled-off when the gallery it was housed in closed. The workshop remained intact, and preserved, and in March 2011 was put on public display as part of a new permanent Science Museum exhibition, "James Watt and our world".[^66]

The approximate location of James Watt's birth in Greenock is commemorated by a statue. Other memorials in Greenock include street names and the Watt Memorial Library, which was begun in 1816 with Watt's donation of scientific books, and developed as part of the Watt Institution by his son (which ultimately became the [James Watt College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt_College "James Watt College")). Taken over by the local authority in 1974, the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of [Inverclyde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverclyde "Inverclyde"), and is dominated by a large seated statue in the [vestibule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_\(architecture\) "Vestibule (architecture)"). Watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in [George Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Square "George Square"), Glasgow and [Princes Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Street "Princes Street"), Edinburgh, as well as others in [Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"), where he is also remembered by the [Moonstones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_Moonstones "Lunar Society Moonstones") and a school is named in his honour.

The James Watt College has expanded from its original location to include campuses in [Kilwinning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwinning "Kilwinning") (North Ayrshire), Finnart Street and The Waterfront in Greenock, and the Sports campus in [Largs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largs "Largs"). [Heriot-Watt University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heriot-Watt_University "Heriot-Watt University") near [Edinburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh") was at one time the School of Arts of Edinburgh, founded in 1821 as the world's first [Mechanics Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics_Institute "Mechanics Institute"), but to commemorate George Heriot, the 16th-century financier to [King James VI and I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_VI_and_I "James VI and I"), and James Watt, after [Royal Charter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter "Royal charter") the name was changed to Heriot-Watt University. Dozens of university and college buildings (chiefly of science and technology) are named after him. Matthew Boulton's home, [Soho House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho_House "Soho House"), is now a museum, commemorating the work of both men. The [University of Glasgow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow "University of Glasgow") 's Faculty of Engineering has its headquarters in the James Watt Building, which also houses the department of Mechanical Engineering and the department of Aerospace Engineering. The huge painting *James Watt contemplating the steam engine* by [James Eckford Lauder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eckford_Lauder "James Eckford Lauder") is now owned by the [National Gallery of Scotland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Scotland "National Gallery of Scotland").

[Chantrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Legatt_Chantrey "Francis Legatt Chantrey") 's statue of James Watt

There is a statue of James Watt in [Piccadilly Gardens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly_Gardens "Piccadilly Gardens"), Manchester and [City Square, Leeds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Square,_Leeds "City Square, Leeds").

A colossal statue of Watt by [Francis Legatt Chantrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Legatt_Chantrey "Francis Legatt Chantrey") was placed in [Westminster Abbey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey "Westminster Abbey"),[^67] and later was moved to [St. Paul's Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul%27s_Cathedral "St. Paul's Cathedral"). On the [cenotaph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph "Cenotaph"), the inscription reads, in part, "JAMES WATT... ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY, INCREASED THE POWER OF MAN, AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE AND THE REAL BENEFACTORS OF THE WORLD".

A bust of Watt is in the Hall of Heroes of the [National Wallace Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wallace_Monument "National Wallace Monument") in [Stirling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling "Stirling"), Scotland.

The [French Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Navy "French Navy") [submarine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine "Submarine") [*Watt*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_submarine_Watt "French submarine Watt") was named for Watt.

[^1]: Although some otherwise reputable sources give his date of death as 19 August 1819, all contemporary accounts report him dying on 25 August and being buried on 2 September. The date 19 August originates from the biography *The Life of James Watt* (1858, p. 521) by [James Patrick Muirhead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Patrick_Muirhead "James Patrick Muirhead"). It draws its (supposed) legitimacy from the fact that Muirhead was a nephew of Watt and therefore should have been well-informed. In the Muirhead papers, 25 August date is mentioned elsewhere. The latter date is also given in contemporary newspaper reports (for example, page 3 of *[The Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")* of 28 August) as well as by an abstract of and codicil to Watt's last will. (In the pertinent burial register of St. Mary's Church (Birmingham-Handsworth) Watt's date of death is not mentioned.)

"His many and most valuable inventions must always place him among the leading benefactors of mankind," says the account of him in the *Dictionary of National Biography*. He was an accomplished man. He knew Greek, Latin, French, German and Italian and was very friendly with the great freethinking French scientists. Andrew Carnegie has written a life of him and describes him as a deist who never went to church.
