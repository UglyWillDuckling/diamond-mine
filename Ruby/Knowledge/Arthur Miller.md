**Arthur Asher Miller** (October 17, 1915 – February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist and screenwriter in the 20th-century [American theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_in_the_United_States "Theater in the United States"). Among his most popular plays are *[All My Sons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Sons "All My Sons")* (1947), *[Death of a Salesman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman "Death of a Salesman")* (1949), *[The Crucible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible "The Crucible")* (1953), and *[A View from the Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_View_from_the_Bridge "A View from the Bridge")* (1955). He wrote several screenplays, including *[The Misfits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_\(1961_film\) "The Misfits (1961 film)")* (1961). The drama *Death of a Salesman* is considered one of the best American plays of the 20th century.

Miller was often in the public eye, particularly during the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. During this time, he received a [Pulitzer Prize for Drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Drama "Pulitzer Prize for Drama"), testified before the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee"), and married [Marilyn Monroe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe "Marilyn Monroe"). In 1980, he received the [St. Louis Literary Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Literary_Award "St. Louis Literary Award") from the [Saint Louis University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_University "Saint Louis University") Library Associates.[^1][^2] He received the [Praemium Imperiale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praemium_Imperiale "Praemium Imperiale") prize in 2001, the [Prince of Asturias Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Asturias_Award "Prince of Asturias Award") in 2002, and the [Jerusalem Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Prize "Jerusalem Prize") in 2003, and the [Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_and_Lillian_Gish_Prize "Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize") in 1999.[^3]

## Early life and education

### 1940–1949: Early career

In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery.[^observer_obit-24] The couple had two children, Jane (born September 7, 1944) and Robert (May 31, 1947 – March 6, 2022).[^25] Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school [football](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football") injury to his left kneecap.[^times_obit-15] In 1944 Miller's first play was produced: *[The Man Who Had All the Luck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Had_All_the_Luck "The Man Who Had All the Luck")* won the Theatre Guild's National Award.[^26] The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews.[^shenton-27]

In 1947, Miller's play *[All My Sons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Sons "All My Sons")*, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on [Broadway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre "Broadway theatre") (earning him his first [Tony Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award "Tony Award"), [for Best Author](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Author "Tony Award for Best Author")) and his reputation as a playwright was established.[^28] Years later, in a 1994 interview with [Ron Rifkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rifkin "Ron Rifkin"), Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded *All My Sons* as "a very depressing play in a time of great optimism" and that positive reviews from [Brooks Atkinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Atkinson "Brooks Atkinson") of *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* had saved it from failure.[^29]

In 1948, Miller built a small studio in [Roxbury, Connecticut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxbury,_Connecticut "Roxbury, Connecticut"). There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of *[Death of a Salesman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman "Death of a Salesman")*. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play,[^chronology-19] one of the classics of world theater.[^times_obit-15][^bbc-obit-30] *Death of a Salesman* premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the [Morosco Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morosco_Theatre "Morosco Theatre"), directed by [Elia Kazan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan "Elia Kazan"), and starring [Lee J. Cobb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_J._Cobb "Lee J. Cobb") as [Willy Loman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Loman "Willy Loman"), [Mildred Dunnock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Dunnock "Mildred Dunnock") as Linda, [Arthur Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kennedy "Arthur Kennedy") as Biff, and [Cameron Mitchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Mitchell_\(actor\) "Cameron Mitchell (actor)") as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a [Tony Award for Best Author](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Author "Tony Award for Best Author"), the [New York Drama Circle Critics' Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Drama_Critics%27_Circle "New York Drama Critics' Circle"), and the [Pulitzer Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Pulitzer_Prize "1949 Pulitzer Prize") for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times.[^times_obit-15]

In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with [Eugene O'Neill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_O%27Neill "Eugene O'Neill") regarding Miller's production of *All My Sons*. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of *Death of a Salesman*. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his [Parkinson's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease") made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to [Boston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"), a trip that never occurred.[^31]

### 1950–1963: Critical years and HUAC controversy

In 1952, [Elia Kazan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan "Elia Kazan") appeared before the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee") (HUAC). Kazan named eight members of the [Group Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Theatre_\(New_York_City\) "Group Theatre (New York City)"), including [Clifford Odets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Odets "Clifford Odets"), [Paula Strasberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Strasberg "Paula Strasberg"), [Lillian Hellman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Hellman "Lillian Hellman"), [J. Edward Bromberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edward_Bromberg "J. Edward Bromberg"), and [John Garfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garfield "John Garfield"),[^32] who in recent years had been fellow members of the [Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA").[^ammasters-33] Miller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's testimony to the HUAC, the pair's friendship ended.[^ammasters-33] After speaking with Kazan about his testimony, Miller traveled to [Salem, Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Massachusetts "Salem, Massachusetts"), to research the [witch trials of 1692](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials "Salem witch trials").[^observer_obit-24] He and Kazan did not speak to each other for the next ten years. Kazan later defended his own actions through his film *[On the Waterfront](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront "On the Waterfront")*, in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.[^34] Miller would retaliate against Kazan's work by writing *[A View from the Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_View_from_the_Bridge "A View from the Bridge")*, a play where a longshoreman outs his co-workers motivated only by jealousy and greed. He sent a copy of the initial script to Kazan and when the director asked in jest to direct the movie, Miller replied "I only sent you the script to let you know what I think of [stool-pigeons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stool-pigeons "Stool-pigeons")."[^35]

In *[The Crucible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible "The Crucible")*, which was first performed at the Martin Beck Theatre on Broadway on January 22, 1953, Miller likened the situation with the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee") to [the witch hunt in Salem in 1692](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials "Salem witch trials").[^36][^37][^cakirtas-38] Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its release, *The Crucible* is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world.[^observer_obit-24] It was adapted into [an opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible_\(opera\) "The Crucible (opera)") by [Robert Ward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ward_\(composer\) "Robert Ward (composer)") in 1961. Earlier in 1955, a [one-act version](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-act_play "One-act play") of Miller's [verse drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_drama_and_dramatic_verse "Verse drama and dramatic verse"), titled *[A View from the Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_View_from_the_Bridge "A View from the Bridge")*, opened on [Broadway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre "Broadway theatre") in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, *[A Memory of Two Mondays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_of_Two_Mondays "A Memory of Two Mondays")*. The following year, Miller revised *A View from the Bridge* as a two-act [prose](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose "Prose") drama, which [Peter Brook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brook "Peter Brook") directed in London.[^39] A French-Italian co-production *[Vu du pont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_View_from_the_Bridge_\(film\) "A View from the Bridge (film)")*, based on the play, was released in 1962.[^40]

 While newsmen take notes, Chairman [Dies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Dies_Jr. "Martin Dies Jr.") of House Un-American Activities Committee reads and proofs his letter replying to Pres. Roosevelt's attack on the committee, October 26, 1938

The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after *The Crucible* opened, engineering the US State Department's denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954.[^chronology-19] When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his [passport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_passport "United States passport"), the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee") used this opportunity to [subpoena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena "Subpoena") him to appear before the committee. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman, [Francis E. Walter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_E._Walter "Francis E. Walter") (D-PA) agreed.[^bbconthisday-41] When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career,[^observer_obit-24] he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities.[^42] Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee demanded the names of friends and colleagues who had participated in similar activities.[^bbconthisday-41] Miller refused to comply, saying "I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him."[^bbconthisday-41] As a result, a judge found Miller guilty of [contempt of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress "Contempt of Congress") in May 1957. Miller was sentenced to a fine and a prison sentence, [blacklisted from Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist "Hollywood blacklist"), and disallowed a US passport.[^umich_early-43] In August 1958, his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of the HUAC.[^bbconthisday-41]

Miller's experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s, he joined other celebrities (including [William Styron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Styron "William Styron") and [Mike Nichols](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nichols "Mike Nichols")) who were brought together by the journalist Joan Barthel. Barthel's coverage of the highly publicized [Barbara Gibbons murder case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Roraback#Peter_Reilly_murder_case "Catherine Roraback") helped raise bail for Gibbons' son Peter Reilly, who had been convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence.[^44] Barthel documented the case in her book *A Death in Canaan*, which was made as a [television film of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Death_in_Canaan "A Death in Canaan") and broadcast in 1978.[^45] *[City Confidential](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Confidential "City Confidential")*, an [A&E Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26E_Network "A&E Network") series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the [Connecticut State Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_State_Police "Connecticut State Police") and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.[^46][^47]

Miller began work on writing the screenplay for *[The Misfits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_\(1961_film\) "The Misfits (1961 film)")* in 1960, directed by [John Huston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston "John Huston") and starring Monroe. It was during the filming that Miller's and Monroe's relationship hit difficulties, and he later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life.[^:0-48] Monroe was taking drugs to help her sleep and other drugs to help her wake up, arriving on the set late, and having trouble remembering her lines. Huston was unaware that Miller and Monroe were having problems in their private life. He recalled later, "I was impertinent enough to say to Arthur that to allow her to take drugs of any kind was criminal and utterly irresponsible. Shortly after that I realized that she wouldn't listen to Arthur at all; he had no say over her actions."[^49]

Shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, Miller and Monroe divorced after five years of marriage.[^chronology-19] Nineteen months later, on August 5, 1962, Monroe died of a likely drug overdose.[^50] Huston, who had also directed her in her first major role in *[The Asphalt Jungle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asphalt_Jungle "The Asphalt Jungle")* in 1950, and who had seen her rise to stardom, put the blame for her death on her doctors as opposed to the stresses of being a star: "The girl was an addict of [sleeping pills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic "Hypnotic") and she was made so by the God-damn doctors. It had nothing to do with the Hollywood set-up."[^51]

### 1964–2004: Later career

In 1964, *[After the Fall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Fall_\(play\) "After the Fall (play)")* was produced, and is said to be a deeply personal view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. It reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan; they collaborated on the script and direction. It opened on January 23, 1964, at the [ANTA Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANTA_Theatre "ANTA Theatre") in [Washington Square Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Square_Park "Washington Square Park") amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, Maggie, on stage.[^observer_obit-24] Robert Brustein, in a review in the *[New Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")*, called *After the Fall* "a three and one half hour breach of taste, a confessional autobiography of embarrassing explicitness ... There is a misogynistic strain in the play which the author does not seem to recognize. ... He has created a shameless piece of tabloid gossip, an act of exhibitionism which makes us all voyeurs ... a wretched piece of dramatic writing."[^52] That year, Miller produced *[Incident at Vichy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_at_Vichy "Incident at Vichy")*. In 1965, he was elected the first American president of [PEN International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEN_International "PEN International"), a position which he held for four years.[^53] A year later, he organized the 1966 PEN congress in New York City. He also wrote the penetrating family drama *[The Price](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_\(play\) "The Price (play)")*, produced in 1968.[^observer_obit-24] It was his most successful play since *Death of a Salesman*.[^umich_60s70s80s-54]

In 1968, Miller attended the [Democratic National Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention "1968 Democratic National Convention") as a delegate for [Eugene McCarthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy "Eugene McCarthy").[^55] In 1969, Miller's works were banned in the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") after he campaigned for the freedom of [dissident writers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_dissidents "Soviet dissidents").[^chronology-19] Throughout the 1970s, he spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as *Fame* and *The Reason Why*, and traveling with his wife, producing *In the Country* and *Chinese Encounters* with her. Both his 1972 comedy *[The Creation of the World and Other Business](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_the_World_and_Other_Business "The Creation of the World and Other Business")* and its musical adaptation, *[Up from Paradise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_from_Paradise "Up from Paradise")*, were critical and commercial failures.[^56][^57]

Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work. In 1978, he published a collection of his *Theater Essays*, edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller. Highlights of the collection included Miller's introduction to his *Collected Plays*, his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater. Reviewing this collection in the *Chicago Tribune,* [Studs Terkel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel "Studs Terkel") remarked, "In reading \[the *Theater Essays*\] ... you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what he's talking about."[^58]

In 1983, Miller traveled to China to produce and direct *Death of a Salesman* at the People's Art Theatre in [Beijing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing"). It was a success in China[^umich_60s70s80s-54] and in 1984, *Salesman in Beijing*, a book about Miller's experiences in Beijing, was published. Around the same time, *Death of a Salesman* was adapted into [a television film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman_\(1985_film\) "Death of a Salesman (1985 film)") starring [Dustin Hoffman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman "Dustin Hoffman") as Willy Loman. The film was broadcast on CBS, and garnered an audience viewership of 25 million.[^chronology-19][^59] In late 1987, Miller's autobiographical work, *Timebends*, was published. Before it was published, it was well known that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; however, in the book, he wrote extensively in detail about his experiences with Monroe.[^observer_obit-24]

During the early 1990s, Miller wrote three new plays: *[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ride_Down_Mt._Morgan "The Ride Down Mt. Morgan")* (1991), *[The Last Yankee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Yankee "The Last Yankee")* (1992), and *[Broken Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Glass_\(play\) "Broken Glass (play)")* (1994). In 1996, [a film adaptation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible_\(1996_film\) "The Crucible (1996 film)") of *The Crucible* starring [Daniel Day-Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis "Daniel Day-Lewis"), [Paul Scofield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scofield "Paul Scofield"), [Bruce Davison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Davison "Bruce Davison") and [Winona Ryder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Ryder "Winona Ryder") was released. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay.[^chronology-19]

*[Mr. Peters' Connections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Peters%27_Connections "Mr. Peters' Connections")* was staged [Off-Broadway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-Broadway "Off-Broadway") in 1998, and *Death of a Salesman* was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The 1999 revival ran for 274 performances at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre, starring [Brian Dennehy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dennehy "Brian Dennehy") as Willy Loman. Once again, it was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.[^60]

In 1993, Miller received the [National Medal of Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Arts "National Medal of Arts").[^61] He was honored with the [PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEN/Laura_Pels_Theater_Award "PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award") for a Master American Dramatist in 1998. In 2001, the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities "National Endowment for the Humanities") selected him for the [Jefferson Lecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lecture "Jefferson Lecture"), the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [humanities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities").[^jefflect-62] His lecture, "On Politics and the Art of Acting",[^63] analyzed political events (including the [U.S. presidential election of 2000](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election "2000 United States presidential election")) in terms of the "arts of performance". It drew attacks from some conservatives[^64] such as [Jay Nordlinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Nordlinger "Jay Nordlinger"), who called it "a disgrace";[^65] and [George Will](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Will "George Will"), who argued that Miller was not a legitimate "scholar".[^66]

In October 1999, Miller received [The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dorothy_and_Lillian_Gish_Prize "The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize"), given annually to "a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind's enjoyment and understanding of life".[^67] Additionally in 1999, [San Jose State University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_State_University "San Jose State University") honored Miller with the [John Steinbeck "In the Souls of the People" Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck_Award "John Steinbeck Award"), which is given to those who capture "Steinbeck’s empathy, commitment to democratic values, and belief in the dignity of people who by circumstance are pushed to the fringes."[^68] In 2001, he received the [National Book Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Book_Foundation "National Book Foundation")'s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.[^69] On May 1, 2002, he received Spain's [Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_de_Asturias_Prize_for_Literature "Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature") as "the undisputed master of modern drama". Later that year, Ingeborg Morath died of [lymphatic cancer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_cancer "Lymphatic cancer")[^70] at the age of 78. The following year, Miller won the [Jerusalem Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Prize "Jerusalem Prize").[^chronology-19]

In December 2004, 89-year-old Miller announced that he had been in love with 34-year-old [minimalist painter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism "Minimalism") Agnes Barley and had been living with her at his Connecticut farm since 2002, and that they intended to marry.[^71] Miller's final play, *[Finishing the Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finishing_the_Picture "Finishing the Picture")*, opened at the [Goodman Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodman_Theatre "Goodman Theatre"), Chicago, in the fall of 2004, with one character said to be based on Barley.[^72] It was reportedly based on his experience during the filming of *The Misfits*,[^73] though Miller insisted the play was a work of fiction with independent characters that were no more than composite shadows of history.[^74]

Miller's writing career spanned over seven decades, and at the time of his death, he was considered one of the 20th century's greatest dramatists.[^bbc-obit-30] After his death, many respected actors, directors, and producers paid tribute to him,[^85] some calling him the last great practitioner of the American stage,[^86] and Broadway theatres darkened their lights in a show of respect.[^87] Miller's alma mater, the [University of Michigan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan"), opened the Arthur Miller Theatre in March 2007. Per his express wish, it is the only theater in the world that bears his name.[^88]

Miller's letters, notes, drafts and other papers are housed at the [Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Ransom_Humanities_Research_Center "Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center") at the University of Texas at Austin. Miller is also a member of the [American Theater Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Theater_Hall_of_Fame "American Theater Hall of Fame"). He was inducted in 1979.[^89][^90] In 1993, he received the [Four Freedoms Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_Award "Four Freedoms Award") for Freedom of Speech.[^91] In 2017, his daughter, Rebecca Miller, a writer and filmmaker, completed a documentary about her father's life, *[Arthur Miller: Writer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller:_Writer "Arthur Miller: Writer")*.[^92] Minor planet [3769 Arthurmiller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3769_Arthurmiller "3769 Arthurmiller") is named after him.[^93] In the 2022 [Netflix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") film *[Blonde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_\(2022_film\) "Blonde (2022 film)")*, Miller was portrayed by [Adrien Brody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Brody "Adrien Brody").[^94]

The Arthur Miller Foundation was founded to honor the legacy of Miller and the New York City Public School education. Its mission is "Promoting increased access and equity to theater arts education in our schools and increasing the number of students receiving theater arts education as an integral part of their academic curriculum."[^95] Its other initiatives include certification of new theater teachers and their placement in public schools, increasing the number of theater teachers in the system from the current<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous. (December 2022)">as of?</span></a></i>]</sup> estimate of 180 teachers in 1800 schools, supporting professional development of all certified theater teachers, and providing teaching artists, cultural partners, physical spaces, and theater ticket allocations for students. The foundation's primary purpose is to provide arts education in the [New York City school system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Department_of_Education "New York City Department of Education"). Its current chancellor is Carmen Farina, a prominent proponent of the [Common Core State Standards Initiative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative "Common Core State Standards Initiative"). The Master Arts Council includes [Alec Baldwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin "Alec Baldwin"), [Ellen Barkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Barkin "Ellen Barkin"), [Bradley Cooper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper "Bradley Cooper"), [Dustin Hoffman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman "Dustin Hoffman"), [Scarlett Johansson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson "Scarlett Johansson"), [Tony Kushner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kushner "Tony Kushner"), [Julianne Moore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julianne_Moore "Julianne Moore"), [Michael Moore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore "Michael Moore"), [Liam Neeson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson "Liam Neeson"), [David O. Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Russell "David O. Russell"), and [Liev Schreiber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liev_Schreiber "Liev Schreiber"). Miller's son-in-law, [Daniel Day-Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis "Daniel Day-Lewis"), has served on the current board of directors since 2016.[^96]

The foundation celebrated Miller's 100th birthday with a one-night performance of his seminal works in November 2015.[^97] The Arthur Miller Foundation currently supports a pilot program in theater and film at the public school Quest to Learn, in partnership with the Institute of Play. The model is being used as an in-school elective theater class and lab. Its objective is to create a sustainable theater education model to disseminate to teachers at professional development workshops.[^98]

Miller donated thirteen boxes of his earliest manuscripts to the [Harry Ransom Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Ransom_Center "Harry Ransom Center") at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin "University of Texas at Austin") in 1961 and 1962.[^99] This collection included the original handwritten notebooks and early typed drafts for *Death of a Salesman*, *The Crucible*, *All My Sons*, and other works. In January, 2018, the Ransom Center announced the acquisition of the remainder of the Miller archive, totaling over 200 boxes.[^100][^101] The full archive opened in November, 2019.[^102]

### Literary and public criticism

[Christopher Bigsby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bigsby "Christopher Bigsby") wrote *Arthur Miller: The Definitive Biography* based on boxes of papers Miller made available to him before his death in 2005.[^times-103] The book was published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which Miller "bitterly attack\[ed\] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement".[^times-103] In his book *Trinity of Passion*, author [Alan M. Wald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_M._Wald "Alan M. Wald") conjectures that Miller was "a member of a writer's unit of the [Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA") around 1946", using the pseudonym Matt Wayne, and editing a drama column in the magazine *[The New Masses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Masses "The New Masses")*.[^wald01-104]

In 1999, the writer [Christopher Hitchens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens "Christopher Hitchens") attacked Miller for comparing the [Monica Lewinsky investigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal "Clinton–Lewinsky scandal") to the [Salem witch hunt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_hunt "Salem witch hunt"). Miller had asserted a parallel between the examination of physical evidence on Lewinsky's dress and the examinations of women's bodies for signs of the "Devil's Marks" in Salem. Hitchens scathingly disputed the parallel.[^105] In his memoir, *[Hitch-22](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitch-22 "Hitch-22")*, Hitchens bitterly noted that Miller, despite his prominence as a left-wing intellectual, had failed to support author [Salman Rushdie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie "Salman Rushdie") during the Iranian [fatwa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa "Fatwa") involving *[The Satanic Verses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses "The Satanic Verses")*.[^106]
