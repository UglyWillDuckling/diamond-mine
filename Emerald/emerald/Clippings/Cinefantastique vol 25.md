As a result, Lasseter and art director [[Ralph Eggleston]] did tests to determine how various colors would react on film, as opposed to video. “We had to learn that early on," said Eggleston.

It takes the film recorder approximately 50 seconds to record a single frame of film, meaning that after nine hours, it will have transferred only 30 seconds of finished film! Consequently, three recorders were operating 24 hours a day, to produce the final results. “It's a significant amount of time,” noted Peachey, “so [producer] Ralph Guggenheim is concerned that we get all the computer rendering and compositing done early enough, so it will be ready for the film recorder.”

Interestingly, the film is being rendered in an aspect ratio of 1.66 to 1, so it can be shown uncropped in European cinemas, but in America it will be projected in a 1.85 to 1 ratio, meaning some of the top and bottom of the image will be lost. “We do all the work in 1.66,” said Reeves, “but we have to remember that it's going to be cropped for 1.85. That means we have to keep the characters in the main action area. 
Sometimes if a character gets too high in a scene, you’ll get his head cropped off. To deal with that, we have guidelines, designed into the computer, which come up and show us the safe action area. Sometimes we forget, and we’ve had several shots that had to be redone, because they were out of the 1.85 frame area.”

For future films, a wide screen CinemaScope ratio of 2.35 to 1, could be easily obtained by a program built into the computer.

> “I could change the system for scope in about five minutes," said Reeves. “We can also change the pixel shape. In video, the pixels aren’t actually square, like they are on film, so we change them for video to make them square, and more squished together. The computer takes all those things into account and really makes it quite easy.”

Another exciting research project being done by DiFrancesco, is a computer program that will correct color fading in Eastman color films. When 3-strip Technicolor was largely abandoned in the fifties, the unstable color dyes used in the cheaper Eastman color process would eventually fade, making color films turn red as quickly as five years after they were made. “I came up with an algorithm to correct color fading,” said DiFrancesco. “Now we can indentify the correct colors, in both negative and print motion picture film, do the calculations on it, and bring it back to it’s normal state.”

Clearly, this process will be a boon to film restoration projects, when it becomes commercially available. One only had to look at such recent film restorations as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, SPARTACUS and MY FAIR LADY, all of which had major color fading problems, to see how valuable this new program will be for film preservation.
