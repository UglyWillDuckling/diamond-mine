## Introduction

The `yield from` keyword is used in PHP to delegate the generation of values to another generator. This allows you to chain multiple generators together, creating a pipeline of sorts that can be used to transform or filter data on-the-fly.

## Example

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `yield from` in PHP:

```php
<?php

function myGenerator()
{
  yield "Hello";
  yield "World";
}

function myOtherGenerator()
{
  yield "!";
}

function myCombinedGenerator()
{
  yield from myGenerator();
  yield from myOtherGenerator();
}

foreach (myCombinedGenerator() as $value) {
  echo $value . " ";
}
```

In the example above, we have three generator functions: `myGenerator()`, `myOtherGenerator()`, and `myCombinedGenerator()`. The first two generators each produce a single value, while the third generator delegates to the first two generators using the `yield from` keyword.

When `myCombinedGenerator()` is called, it first yields the values generated by `myGenerator()`, and then it yields the values generated by `myOtherGenerator()`. This creates a sequence of three values: "Hello", "World", and "!".

The `foreach` loop then uses `myCombinedGenerator()` to iterate over the sequence of values, producing the output: "Hello World!".

The `yield from` keyword can be particularly useful when working with nested data structures or when you need to perform a series of transformations on a dataset. By chaining multiple generators together, you can break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable pieces, making your code easier to read and maintain.
