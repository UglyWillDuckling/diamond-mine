**Colorado**[^2] is a [state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state") in the [Western United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States "Western United States"). It is one of the [Mountain states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_states "Mountain states"), sharing the [Four Corners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners "Four Corners") region with [Arizona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona"), [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), and [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah"). It is also bordered by [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming") to the north, [Nebraska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska "Nebraska") to the northeast, [Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas "Kansas") to the east, and [Oklahoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma "Oklahoma") to the southeast. Colorado is noted for its landscape of [mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains "Mountains"), [forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forests "Forests"), [high plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Plains_\(United_States\) "High Plains (United States)"), [mesas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesas "Mesas"), [canyons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyons "Canyons"), [plateaus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateaus "Plateaus"), [rivers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers "Rivers"), and [desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert") lands. It encompasses most of the [Southern Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rocky_Mountains "Southern Rocky Mountains"), as well as the northeastern portion of the [Colorado Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Plateau "Colorado Plateau") and the western edge of the [Great Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains "Great Plains"). Colorado is the [eighth-largest U.S. state by area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_area "List of U.S. states and territories by area") and the [21st by population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population "List of U.S. states and territories by population"). The [United States Census Bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau "United States Census Bureau") estimated the population of Colorado to be 5,957,493 as of July 1, 2024, a 3.2% increase from the [2020 United States census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census "2020 United States census").[^26]

The region has been inhabited by [Native Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States") and their [ancestors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indians "Paleo-Indians") for at least 13,500 years and possibly much longer. The eastern edge of the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains") was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. In 1848, much of the [Nuevo México](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_M%C3%A9xico "Santa Fe de Nuevo México") region was annexed to the United States with the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo "Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo"). The [Pike's Peak Gold Rush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike%27s_Peak_Gold_Rush "Pike's Peak Gold Rush") of 1858–1862 created an influx of settlers. On February 28, 1861, [U.S. President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")[James Buchanan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan "James Buchanan") signed [an act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Organic_Act "Colorado Organic Act") creating the [Territory of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Colorado "Territory of Colorado"),[^21] and on August 1, 1876, President [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant "Ulysses S. Grant") signed [Proclamation 230](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Statehood_Proclamation "Colorado Statehood Proclamation"), admitting Colorado to the [Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") as the 38th state.[^22] The Spanish adjective *"colorado"* means "colored red" or "ruddy". Colorado is nicknamed the "[Centennial State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_nicknames "List of U.S. state nicknames")" because it became a state 100 years (and four weeks) after the signing of the [United States Declaration of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence").

[Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver "Denver") is the capital, the [most populous city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_municipalities_by_population "Colorado municipalities by population"), and the center of the [Front Range Urban Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range_Urban_Corridor "Front Range Urban Corridor"). [Colorado Springs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado "Colorado Springs, Colorado") is the second-most populous city of the state. Residents of the state are known as [Coloradans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_from_Colorado "List of people from Colorado"), although the antiquated "Coloradoan" is occasionally used.[^31][^32] Major parts of the [economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Colorado "Economy of Colorado") include government and defense, mining, [agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Colorado#Agriculture "Economy of Colorado"), tourism, and increasingly other kinds of manufacturing. With increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability, Colorado's agriculture forestry and tourism economies are [expected to be heavily affected by climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Colorado "Climate change in Colorado").[^33]

## History

Main articles: [Prehistory of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory_of_Colorado "Prehistory of Colorado") and [History of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Colorado "History of Colorado")For a chronological guide, see [Timeline of Colorado history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Colorado_history "Timeline of Colorado history").![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Mesa-Verde---Cliff-Palace-in_1891_-_edit1.jpg/220px-Mesa-Verde---Cliff-Palace-in_1891_-_edit1.jpg)

The region that is today the State of Colorado has been inhabited by [Native Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") and their [Paleoamerican ancestors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indians "Paleo-Indians") for at least 13,500 years and possibly more than 37,000 years.[^34][^35] The eastern edge of the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains") was a major migration route that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [Lindenmeier site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenmeier_site "Lindenmeier site") in [Larimer County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larimer_County,_Colorado "Larimer County, Colorado") contains artifacts dating from approximately 8720 BCE. The [Ancient Pueblo peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Pueblo_peoples "Ancient Pueblo peoples") lived in the valleys and mesas of the [Colorado Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Plateau "Colorado Plateau") in far southwestern Colorado.[^36] The [Ute Nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_Nation "Ute Nation") inhabited the mountain valleys of the [Southern Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rocky_Mountains "Southern Rocky Mountains") and the [Western Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Rocky_Mountains "Western Rocky Mountains"), even as far east as the Front Range of the present day. The [Apache](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache "Apache") and the [Comanche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche "Comanche") also inhabited the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. In the 17th century, the [Arapaho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho_Nation "Arapaho Nation") and [Cheyenne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Nation "Cheyenne Nation") moved west from the [Great Lakes region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_region "Great Lakes region") to hunt across the [High Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Plains_\(United_States\) "High Plains (United States)") of Colorado and [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming").

The [Spanish Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") claimed Colorado as part of [Nuevo México](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_M%C3%A9xico "Santa Fe de Nuevo México"). The U.S. acquired the territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [Louisiana Purchase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase "Louisiana Purchase") from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [Arkansas River Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_River "Arkansas River"). In 1806, [Zebulon Pike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebulon_Pike "Zebulon Pike") led a [U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Expedition "Pike Expedition") into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his troops were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [San Luis Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Valley "San Luis Valley") the following February, taken to [Chihuahua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua,_Chihuahua "Chihuahua, Chihuahua"), and expelled from Mexico the following July.

The U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [Arkansas River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_River "Arkansas River") and south of [42nd parallel north](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/42nd_parallel_north "42nd parallel north") and west of the [100th meridian west](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/100th_meridian_west "100th meridian west") as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [Adams-Onís Treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams-On%C3%ADs_Treaty "Adams-Onís Treaty") of 1819. The treaty took effect on February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [Territory of Missouri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Territory "Missouri Territory") to the Union as the [state of Missouri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri "Missouri") on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became an unorganized territory and remained so for 33 years over the [question of slavery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States"). After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [Treaty of Córdoba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_C%C3%B3rdoba "Treaty of Córdoba") signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1831. The [Texian Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texian_Revolt "Texian Revolt") of 1835–36 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [Mexican–American War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War "Mexican–American War") in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo "Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo") after the war in 1848; this included much of the western and southern areas of Colorado.

Map of the [Mexican Cession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Cession "Mexican Cession"), with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [Republic of Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas "Republic of Texas")) after the [Mexican–American War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War "Mexican–American War"). Well over half of Colorado was received from this treaty.

Most American settlers first traveled to Colorado through the [Santa Fe Trail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail "Santa Fe Trail"), which connected the U.S. to [Santa Fe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico "Santa Fe, New Mexico") and the [Camino Real de Tierra Adentro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_Real_de_Tierra_Adentro "Camino Real de Tierra Adentro") southward. Others were traveling overland west to the [Oregon Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Country "Oregon Country"), the new [goldfields of California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush "California gold rush"), or the new [Mormon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon "Mormon") settlements of the [State of Deseret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret "State of Deseret") in the [Salt Lake Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Valley "Salt Lake Valley"), avoided the rugged [Southern Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rocky_Mountains "Southern Rocky Mountains"), and instead followed the [North Platte River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Platte_River "North Platte River") and [Sweetwater River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_River_\(Wyoming\) "Sweetwater River (Wyoming)") to [South Pass (Wyoming)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pass_\(Wyoming\) "South Pass (Wyoming)"), the lowest crossing of the [Continental Divide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide "Continental Divide") between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [State of Deseret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret "State of Deseret"), claiming the entire [Great Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Basin "Great Basin") and all lands drained by the rivers [Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_\(Colorado_River\) "Green River (Colorado River)"), [Grand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River "Colorado River"), and [Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River "Colorado River"). The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government because it was [theocratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Brigham_Young's_early_theocratic_leadership "History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints") and [sanctioned](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_\(law\) "Sanctions (law)")[plural marriage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_polygamy "Mormonism and polygamy"). Instead, the [Compromise of 1850](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1850 "Compromise of 1850") divided the [Mexican Cession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Cession "Mexican Cession") and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [state of California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_California "State of California"), the [Territory of New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_New_Mexico "Territory of New Mexico"), and the [Territory of Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Utah "Territory of Utah"). On April 9, 1851, [Hispano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanos_of_New_Mexico "Hispanos of New Mexico") settlers from the area of [Taos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos,_New_Mexico "Taos, New Mexico") settled the village of [San Luis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis,_Colorado "San Luis, Colorado"), then in the [New Mexico Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory "New Mexico Territory"), as Colorado's first permanent [Euro-American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_American "European American")[settlement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_\(migration\) "Settlement (migration)"), further cementing the traditions of [New Mexican cuisine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexican_cuisine "New Mexican cuisine") and [New Mexico music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_music "New Mexico music") in the developing [Southern Rocky Mountain Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rocky_Mountain_Front "Southern Rocky Mountain Front").[^37][^38]

In 1854, Senator [Stephen A. Douglas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas "Stephen A. Douglas") persuaded the [U.S. Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress "U.S. Congress") to divide the unorganized territory east of the [Continental Divide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide "Continental Divide") into two new organized territories, the [Territory of Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Kansas "Territory of Kansas") and the [Territory of Nebraska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Nebraska "Territory of Nebraska"), and an unorganized southern region known as the [Indian Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory "Indian Territory"). Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [free soil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_soil "Free soil") and [pro-slavery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proslavery_in_the_antebellum_United_States "Proslavery in the antebellum United States") factions.

The gold seekers organized the [Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Territory "Jefferson Territory") on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [Congress of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States "Congress of the United States") embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln") for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [secession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession "Secession") of nine southern [slave states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states "Slave states") and the threat of [civil war among the states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"). Seeking to augment the political power of the [Union states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_state_\(United_States\) "Free state (United States)"), the [Republican Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)")\-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [Territory of Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Kansas "Territory of Kansas") into the [Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") as the free [State of Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas "Kansas") on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

### Territory act

Main articles: [Organic act § List of organic acts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_act#List_of_organic_acts "Organic act"), [New Mexico Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory "New Mexico Territory"), [Utah Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Territory "Utah Territory"), [Kansas–Nebraska Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska_Act "Kansas–Nebraska Act"), [Kansas Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Territory "Kansas Territory"), [Nebraska Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Territory "Nebraska Territory"), [Colorado Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Territory "Colorado Territory"), and [Pike's Peak Gold Rush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike%27s_Peak_Gold_Rush "Pike's Peak Gold Rush")

The territories of [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory "New Mexico Territory"), [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Territory "Utah Territory"), [Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Territory "Kansas Territory"), and [Nebraska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Territory "Nebraska Territory") before the creation of the [Territory of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Colorado "Territory of Colorado")

Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [James Buchanan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan "James Buchanan") signed an Act of Congress organizing the [free](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_state_\(United_States\) "Free state (United States)")[Territory of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Colorado "Territory of Colorado").[^21] The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments. In 1776, Spanish priest [Silvestre Vélez de Escalante](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvestre_V%C3%A9lez_de_Escalante "Silvestre Vélez de Escalante") recorded that Native Americans in the area knew the river as *[el Rio Colorado](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Colorado "es:Rio Colorado")* for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.[^39] In 1859, a U.S. Army [topographic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography "Topography") expedition led by Captain [John Macomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Navarre_Macomb,_Jr. "John Navarre Macomb, Jr.") located the confluence of the [Green River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_\(Colorado_River\) "Green River (Colorado River)") with the [Grand River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_River_\(Colorado\) "Grand River (Colorado)") in what is now [Canyonlands National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyonlands_National_Park "Canyonlands National Park") in [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah").[^40] The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River.

On April 12, 1861, [South Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina "South Carolina") artillery opened fire on [Fort Sumter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumter "Fort Sumter") to start the [American Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"). While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [Confederacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America"), the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_\(American_Civil_War\) "Union (American Civil War)") cause.

In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [Territory of New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_New_Mexico "Territory of New Mexico") and captured [Santa Fe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico "Santa Fe, New Mexico") on March 10. The object of this [Western Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Campaign "New Mexico Campaign") was to seize or disrupt Colorado and California's gold fields and seize Pacific Ocean ports for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [Denver City, Colorado Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_City,_Colorado_Territory "Denver City, Colorado Territory"), to [Glorieta Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorieta_Pass "Glorieta Pass"), New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [Battle of Glorieta Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Glorieta_Pass "Battle of Glorieta Pass"), destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.[^41] The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [San Antonio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio") in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.

In 1864, [Territorial Governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Colorado "Governor of Colorado")[John Evans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Evans_\(Colorado_governor\) "John Evans (Colorado governor)") appointed the Reverend [John Chivington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chivington "John Chivington") as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [Cheyenne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne "Cheyenne") and [Arapaho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho "Arapaho") warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his troops to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that the bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [Andrew Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Johnson "Andrew Johnson") asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [Sand Creek massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre "Sand Creek massacre").

In the midst and aftermath of the Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [Argentine Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Pass "Argentine Pass"), the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [Union Pacific Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Railroad "Union Pacific Railroad") laid its tracks west to Weir, now [Julesburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julesburg,_Colorado "Julesburg, Colorado"), in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [Central Pacific Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Pacific_Railroad "Central Pacific Railroad") at [Promontory Summit, Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promontory_Summit,_Utah "Promontory Summit, Utah"), on May 10, 1869, to form the [First transcontinental railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad "First transcontinental railroad"). The [Denver Pacific Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Pacific_Railway "Denver Pacific Railway") reached Denver in June of the following year, and the [Kansas Pacific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Pacific "Kansas Pacific") arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [San Juan Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Mountains "San Juan Mountains") on the [Ute Indian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_tribe "Ute tribe") reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juan Mountains the following year.

The [United States Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-third_United_States_Congress "Forty-third United States Congress") passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the Territory of Colorado to become a state.[^42] On August 1, 1876 (four weeks after the [Centennial of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_of_the_United_States "Centennial of the United States")), U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state and earning it the moniker "Centennial State".[^22]

The discovery of a major silver lode near [Leadville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville,_Colorado "Leadville, Colorado") in 1878 triggered the [Colorado Silver Boom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Silver_Boom "Colorado Silver Boom"). The [Sherman Silver Purchase Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Silver_Purchase_Act "Sherman Silver Purchase Act") of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [Cripple Creek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cripple_Creek,_Colorado "Cripple Creek, Colorado") a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [universal suffrage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage "Universal suffrage") and the first one by a [popular vote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_Colorado_women%27s_suffrage_referendum "1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum") (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered. Between the 1880s and 1930s, Denver's floriculture industry developed into a major industry in Colorado.[^43][^44] This period became known locally as the [Carnation Gold Rush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Gold_Rush "Carnation Gold Rush").[^45]

### Twentieth and twenty-first centuries

16th Street in Denver in 1912

The ruins of the [Ludlow Colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_massacre "Ludlow massacre") in the aftermath of the 1914 massacre.

Poor labor conditions and discontent among miners resulted in several major clashes between strikers and the [Colorado National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Army_National_Guard "Colorado Army National Guard"), including the [1903–1904 Western Federation of Miners Strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Labor_Wars "Colorado Labor Wars") and [Colorado Coalfield War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War "Colorado Coalfield War"), the latter of which included the [Ludlow massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_massacre "Ludlow massacre") that killed a dozen women and children.[^46][^47] Both the 1913–1914 Coalfield War and the [Denver streetcar strike of 1920](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_streetcar_strike_of_1920 "Denver streetcar strike of 1920") resulted in federal troops intervening to end the violence.[^48] In 1927, the [1927-28 Colorado coal strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1927%E2%80%931928_Colorado_Coal_Strike "1927–1928 Colorado Coal Strike") occurred and was ultimately successful in winning a dollar a day increase in wages.[^49][^50] During it however the [Columbine Mine massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_Mine_massacre "Columbine Mine massacre") resulted in six dead strikers following a confrontation with [Colorado Rangers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rangers "Colorado Rangers").[^51][^52] In a separate incident in [Trinidad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad,_Colorado "Trinidad, Colorado") the mayor was accused of deputizing members of the KKK against the striking workers.[^53] More than 5,000 Colorado miners—many immigrants—are estimated to have died in accidents since records were first formally collected following an 1884 accident in [Crested Butte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Butte,_Colorado "Crested Butte, Colorado") that killed 59.[^54]

In 1924, the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan "Ku Klux Klan") Colorado Realm achieved dominance in Colorado politics. With peak membership levels, the [Second Klan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Second_Klan "Ku Klux Klan") levied significant control over both the local and state [Democrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") and [Republican parties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)"), particularly in the governor's office and city governments of Denver, [Cañon City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_City,_Colorado "Canon City, Colorado"), and [Durango](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango,_Colorado "Durango, Colorado"). A particularly strong element of the Klan controlled the [Denver Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Police_Department "Denver Police Department").[^55][Cross burnings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_burning "Cross burning") became semi-regular occurrences in cities such as [Florence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence,_Colorado "Florence, Colorado") and Pueblo. The Klan targeted African-Americans, [Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), Eastern European immigrants, and other non-White [Protestant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") groups.[^56] Efforts by non-Klan lawmen and lawyers including [Philip Van Cise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_S._Van_Cise "Philip S. Van Cise") led to a rapid decline in the organization's power, with membership waning significantly by the end of the 1920s.[^55]

Three [10th Mountain Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_Mountain_Division "10th Mountain Division") skitroopers above [Camp Hale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Hale "Camp Hale") in February 1944

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") met in Denver in 1908. By the [U.S. census in 1930](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census,_1930 "United States Census, 1930"), the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") and the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl") of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [United States Census Bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau "United States Census Bureau") estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

On September 11, 1957, a plutonium fire occurred at the [Rocky Flats Plant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant "Rocky Flats Plant"), which resulted in the significant [plutonium contamination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination_from_the_Rocky_Flats_Plant "Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant") of surrounding populated areas.[^57]

Skiers on [Aspen Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Mountain_\(ski_area\) "Aspen Mountain (ski area)") in 1961

From the 1940s and 1970s, many protest movements gained momentum in Colorado, predominantly in Denver. This included the [Chicano Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicano_Movement "Chicano Movement"), a [civil rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movements "Civil rights movements"), and social movement of [Mexican Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Americans "Mexican Americans") emphasizing a [Chicano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicano "Chicano") identity that is widely considered to have begun in Denver.[^58] The National [Chicano Youth Liberation Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicano_Youth_Liberation_Conference "Chicano Youth Liberation Conference") was held in Colorado in March 1969.[^59]

In 1967, Colorado was the first state to loosen restrictions on [abortion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Colorado "Abortion in Colorado") when governor [John Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arthur_Love "John Arthur Love") signed a law allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest, or threats to the woman's mental or physical health. Many states followed Colorado's lead in loosening abortion laws in the 1960s and 1970s.[^60]

Since the late 1990s, Colorado has been the site of [multiple major](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shootings_in_Colorado "List of shootings in Colorado")[mass shootings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting "Mass shooting"), including the infamous [Columbine High School massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre "Columbine High School massacre") in 1999 which made international news, where [two gunmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold "Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold") killed 12 students and one teacher, before committing suicide. The incident has spawned many [copycat incidents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_effect "Columbine effect").[^61] On July 20, 2012, a [gunman killed 12 people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora,_Colorado_shooting "2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting") in a movie theater in [Aurora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Colorado "Aurora, Colorado"). The state responded with tighter restrictions on firearms, including [introducing a limit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-capacity_magazine_ban "High-capacity magazine ban") on [magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_\(firearms\) "Magazine (firearms)") capacity.[^62] On March 22, 2021, a [gunman killed 10 people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Boulder_shooting "2021 Boulder shooting"), including a police officer, in a [King Soopers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Soopers "King Soopers") supermarket in [Boulder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado").[^63] In an instance of [anti-LGBT violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_LGBT_people "Violence against LGBT people"), a [gunman killed 5 people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs_nightclub_shooting "Colorado Springs nightclub shooting") at a nightclub in [Colorado Springs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado "Colorado Springs, Colorado") during the night of November 19–20, 2022.[^64]

Four warships of the [U.S. Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy "U.S. Navy") have been named the [USS *Colorado*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Colorado "USS Colorado"). The first USS *Colorado* was named for the Colorado River and served in the Civil War and later the [Asiatic Squadron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_Squadron "Asiatic Squadron"), where it was attacked during the 1871 [Korean Expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_expedition_to_Korea "United States expedition to Korea"). The later three ships were named in honor of the state, including [an armored cruiser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Colorado_\(ACR-7\) "USS Colorado (ACR-7)") and the [battleship USS *Colorado*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Colorado_\(BB-45\) "USS Colorado (BB-45)"), the latter of which was the lead ship of [her class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado-class_battleship "Colorado-class battleship") and served in [World War II in the Pacific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Pacific "War in the Pacific") beginning in 1941. At the time of the [attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "Attack on Pearl Harbor"), the battleship USS *Colorado* was located at the naval base in San Diego, California, and thus went unscathed. The most recent vessel to bear the name USS *Colorado* is [Virginia-class submarine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia-class_submarine "Virginia-class submarine")[USS *Colorado* (SSN-788)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Colorado_\(SSN-788\) "USS Colorado (SSN-788)"), which was commissioned in 2018.[^65]

## Geography

Main article: [Geography of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Colorado "Geography of Colorado")

Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. In 1861, the [United States Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-sixth_United_States_Congress "Thirty-sixth United States Congress") defined the boundaries of the new [Territory of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Colorado "Territory of Colorado") exclusively by lines of [latitude](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"), stretching from [37°N](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/37th_parallel_north "37th parallel north") to [41°N](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/41st_parallel_north "41st parallel north") latitude, and from [102°02′48″W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/25th_meridian_west_from_Washington "25th meridian west from Washington") to [109°02′48″W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/32nd_meridian_west_from_Washington "32nd meridian west from Washington") longitude ([25°W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/25th_meridian_west_from_Washington "25th meridian west from Washington") to [32°W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/32nd_meridian_west_from_Washington "32nd meridian west from Washington") from the [Washington Meridian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Meridian "Washington Meridian")).[^21] After 164 years of government surveys, the borders of Colorado were officially defined by 697 [boundary markers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_marker "Boundary marker") and 697 [straight boundary lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border "Border").[^66] Colorado, [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming"), and [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah") are the only states that have their borders defined solely by straight boundary lines with no natural features.[^67] The southwest corner of Colorado is the [Four Corners Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners_Monument "Four Corners Monument") at [36°59′56″N](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/37th_parallel_north "37th parallel north"), [109°2′43″W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/32nd_meridian_west_from_Washington "32nd meridian west from Washington").[^68][^3] The [Four Corners Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners_Monument "Four Corners Monument"), located at the place where Colorado, [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), [Arizona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona"), and [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah") meet, is the only place in the United States where four states meet.[^67]

### Plains

The arid high plains in Southeastern Colorado

Approximately half of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains is the [Colorado Eastern Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Eastern_Plains "Colorado Eastern Plains") of the [High Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Plains_\(United_States\) "High Plains (United States)"), the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from roughly 3,350 to 7,500 feet (1,020 to 2,290 m).[^69] The Colorado plains are mostly prairies but also include [deciduous forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_forests "Deciduous forests"), [buttes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte "Butte"), and canyons. Precipitation averages 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 mm) annually.[^70]

Eastern Colorado is presently mainly farmland and rangeland, along with small farming villages and towns. [Corn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), [wheat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat"), [hay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay "Hay"), [soybeans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean "Soybean"), and [oats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat "Oat") are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [grain elevator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_elevator "Grain elevator"). Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the [South Platte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Platte "South Platte"), the [Arkansas River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_River "Arkansas River"), and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [artesian wells](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesian_well "Artesian well"). Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.[^71]

### Front Range

[Front Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range "Front Range") Peaks west of Denver

Roughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [Front Range Urban Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range_Urban_Corridor "Front Range Urban Corridor") between [Cheyenne, Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming "Cheyenne, Wyoming"), and [Pueblo, Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado "Pueblo, Colorado"). This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The "Front Range" includes Denver, [Boulder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado"), [Fort Collins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Collins,_Colorado "Fort Collins, Colorado"), Loveland, [Castle Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock,_Colorado "Castle Rock, Colorado"), Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in western Colorado (which is known as "The Western Slope") are the cities of [Grand Junction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Junction,_Colorado "Grand Junction, Colorado"), [Durango](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango,_Colorado "Durango, Colorado"), and [Montrose](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose,_Colorado "Montrose, Colorado").

### Mountains

See also: [List of mountain peaks of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountain_peaks_of_Colorado "List of mountain peaks of Colorado")

[Mount Elbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elbert "Mount Elbert") at 14,440 feet (4,401.2 m) is the highest summit of the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains") and Colorado.

To the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains"). Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [Longs Peak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longs_Peak "Longs Peak"), [Mount Blue Sky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Blue_Sky "Mount Blue Sky"), [Pikes Peak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikes_Peak "Pikes Peak"), and the [Spanish Peaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Peaks "Spanish Peaks") near [Walsenburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsenburg,_Colorado "Walsenburg, Colorado"), in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [Mississippi River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River "Mississippi River") or the [Rio Grande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande "Rio Grande") into the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico").

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 true peaks and 58 named peaks[^72] that are 14,000 feet (4,267 m) or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [fourteeners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_fourteeners "Colorado fourteeners").[^73] These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [conifers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer "Conifer") and [aspens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen "Aspen") up to the [tree line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_line "Tree line"), at an elevation of about 12,000 feet (3,658 m) in southern Colorado to about 10,500 feet (3,200 m) in northern Colorado. Above this tree line, only alpine vegetation grows.

Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August except for a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [Colorado Mineral Belt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Mineral_Belt "Colorado Mineral Belt"), stretching from the [San Juan Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Mountains "San Juan Mountains") in the southwest to [Boulder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado") and [Central City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_City,_Colorado "Central City, Colorado") on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. The 30 [highest major summits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_mountain_peaks_of_the_Rocky_Mountains "Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains") of the Rocky Mountains of North America are all within the state.

The summit of Mount Elbert at 14,437.6 feet (4,400.58 m) elevation in [Lake County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Colorado "Lake County, Colorado") is the highest point in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains of North America.[^24][^74] Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above 1,000 meters elevation. The point where the [Arikaree River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arikaree_River "Arikaree River") flows out of [Yuma County, Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuma_County,_Colorado "Yuma County, Colorado"), and into [Cheyenne County, Kansas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_County,_Kansas "Cheyenne County, Kansas"), is the lowest in Colorado at 3,317 feet (1,011 m) elevation. This point, which is the highest low elevation point of any state,[^25][^75] is higher than the high elevation points of 18 states and the District of Columbia.

#### Continental Divide

[Grays Peak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grays_Peak "Grays Peak"), at 14,278 feet (4,352 m), is the highest point on the [Continental Divide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas "Continental Divide of the Americas") in North America.

The [Continental Divide of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas "Continental Divide of the Americas") extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [Western Slope of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Western_Slope "Colorado Western Slope"). West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [Colorado River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_\(U.S.\) "Colorado River (U.S.)") and the [Green River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_\(Colorado_River\) "Green River (Colorado River)") towards the [Gulf of California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California "Gulf of California").

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [North Park of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Park_\(Colorado_basin\) "North Park (Colorado basin)"). The North Park is drained by the [North Platte River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Platte_River "North Platte River"), which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [Middle Park of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Park_\(Colorado_basin\) "Middle Park (Colorado basin)"), which is drained by the Colorado River. The [South Park of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park_\(Park_County,_Colorado\) "South Park (Park County, Colorado)") is the region of the [headwaters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headwater "Headwater") of the South Platte River.

### South Central region

The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado

In south-central Colorado is the large [San Luis Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Valley "San Luis Valley"), where the headwaters of the [Rio Grande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande "Rio Grande") are located. The northern part of the valley is the [San Luis Closed Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Closed_Basin "San Luis Closed Basin"), an [endorheic basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin "Endorheic basin") that helped created the [Great Sand Dunes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sand_Dunes_National_Park_and_Preserve "Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve"). The valley sits between the [Sangre de Cristo Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangre_de_Cristo_Mountains "Sangre de Cristo Mountains") and [San Juan Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Mountains "San Juan Mountains"). The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. Across the [Sangre de Cristo Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangre_de_Cristo_Range "Sangre de Cristo Range") to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [Wet Mountain Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_Mountain_Valley "Wet Mountain Valley"). These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [Rio Grande rift](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_rift "Rio Grande rift"), a major [geological formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_formation "Geological formation") of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.

### Western Slope

[Maroon Bells](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_Bells "Maroon Bells"), at 14,163 ft (4,317 m), is part of [White River National Forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_River_National_Forest "White River National Forest") and a tourist destination

The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.

The Western Slope of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the area to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west to Utah. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument "Dinosaur National Monument"), which not only is a [paleontological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology "Paleontology") area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [Gunnison River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnison_River "Gunnison River"), [Green River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_\(Colorado_River\) "Green River (Colorado River)"), and the [San Juan River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_River_\(Colorado_River\) "San Juan River (Colorado River)")). The Colorado River flows through [Glenwood Canyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenwood_Canyon "Glenwood Canyon"), and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [Rifle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle,_Colorado "Rifle, Colorado") to [Parachute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute,_Colorado "Parachute, Colorado"), through the desert canyon of [De Beque Canyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beque_Canyon "De Beque Canyon"), and into the arid desert of [Grand Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Valley_\(Colorado-Utah\) "Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)"), where the city of Grand Junction is located.

Also prominent is the [Grand Mesa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mesa "Grand Mesa"), which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the north and west of the San Juan Mountains, the [Colorado Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Plateau "Colorado Plateau").

[Grand Junction, Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Junction,_Colorado "Grand Junction, Colorado"), at the confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers, is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [television broadcasting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_broadcasting "Television broadcasting") west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located at the juncture of [Interstate 70](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70_in_Colorado "Interstate 70 in Colorado") and US 50, the only major highways in western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [Union Pacific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific "Union Pacific"). This railroad also provides the tracks for [Amtrak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak "Amtrak")'s *[California Zephyr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Zephyr "California Zephyr")* passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction.

The Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [Glenwood Springs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenwood_Springs,_Colorado "Glenwood Springs, Colorado"), with its resort hot springs, and the [ski resorts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_resort "Ski resort") of [Aspen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado "Aspen, Colorado"), [Breckenridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breckenridge,_Colorado "Breckenridge, Colorado"), [Vail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vail,_Colorado "Vail, Colorado"), [Crested Butte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Butte,_Colorado "Crested Butte, Colorado"), [Steamboat Springs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Springs,_Colorado "Steamboat Springs, Colorado"), and [Telluride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluride,_Colorado "Telluride, Colorado").

Higher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [Colorado Mesa University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Mesa_University "Colorado Mesa University") in Grand Junction, [Western Colorado University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Colorado_University "Western Colorado University") in Gunnison, [Fort Lewis College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lewis_College "Fort Lewis College") in Durango, and [Colorado Mountain College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Mountain_College "Colorado Mountain College") in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.

The [Four Corners Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners_Monument "Four Corners Monument") in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), [Arizona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona"), and [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah"); the only such place in the United States.

## Climate

[Köppen climate types](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") of Colorado, using 1991–2020 [climate normals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatological_normal "Climatological normal")

The [climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [Mountain States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_States "Mountain States") region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect the local climate. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

### Eastern Plains

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [semi-arid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") ([Köppen climate classification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"): [*BSk*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_semi-arid_climate "Cold semi-arid climate")) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 millimeters) annually, although many areas near the rivers are semi-humid climate. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [diurnal temperature range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation "Diurnal temperature variation"). The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [precipitation shadow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow "Rain shadow") as a result of being on the [lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeward "Leeward") side of the Rocky Mountains.[^76]

In summer, this area can have many days above 95 °F (35 °C) and often 100 °F (38 °C).[^77] On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to −10 °F (−4 to −23 °C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.[^78]

In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [Chinook winds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_wind "Chinook wind") which warms the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70 °F (21 °C) or higher in the winter.[^78] The average July temperature is 55 °F (13 °C) in the morning and 90 °F (32 °C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18 °F (−8 °C) in the morning and 48 °F (9 °C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40 °F (4 °C).

### Front Range foothills

Just west of the plains and into the foothills, there is a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [alpine climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_climate "Alpine climate") at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (*Cfb/Cwb*), humid subtropical (*Cfa*), humid continental (*Dfa/Dfb*), Mediterranean (*Csa/Csb*) and subarctic (*Dfc*).[^79]

### Extreme weather

Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern Plains, especially the northeast part of the state. Hail is the most commonly reported warm-season severe weather hazard, and occasionally causes human injuries, as well as significant property damage.[^80] The eastern Plains are subject to some of the biggest hail storms in North America.[^70] Notable examples are the severe hailstorms that hit Denver on July 11, 1990,[^81] and May 8, 2017, the latter being the costliest ever in the state.[^82]

The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [Tornado Alley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley "Tornado Alley"); some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [Limon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limon,_Colorado "Limon, Colorado")[F3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujita_scale "Fujita scale") tornado and the [2008 Windsor EF3 tornado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak_of_May_22%E2%80%9327,_2008#Windsor,_Colorado "Tornado outbreak of May 22–27, 2008"), which devastated a small town.[^83] Portions of the eastern Plains see especially frequent tornadoes, both those spawned from [mesocyclones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesocyclone "Mesocyclone") in [supercell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell "Supercell") thunderstorms and from less intense [landspouts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landspout "Landspout"), such as within the [Denver convergence vorticity zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_convergence_vorticity_zone "Denver convergence vorticity zone") (DCVZ).[^80]

The Plains are also susceptible to occasional floods and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Notable examples include the [1965 Denver Flood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1965_Denver_Flood&action=edit&redlink=1 "1965 Denver Flood (page does not exist)"),[^84] the [Big Thompson River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Thompson_River "Big Thompson River") flooding of 1976 and the [2013 Colorado floods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Colorado_floods "2013 Colorado floods"). Hot weather is common during summers in Denver. The city's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90 °F (32 °C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.[^85]

Much of Colorado is very dry, with the state averaging only 17 inches (430 millimeters) of precipitation per year statewide. The state rarely experiences a time when some portion is not in some degree of drought.[^86] The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the [Hayman Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayman_Fire "Hayman Fire") of 2002. Other notable fires include the [Fourmile Canyon Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourmile_Canyon#Fourmile_Canyon_Fire "Fourmile Canyon") of 2010, the [Waldo Canyon Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo_Canyon_Fire "Waldo Canyon Fire") and [High Park Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Park_Fire "High Park Fire") of June 2012, and the [Black Forest Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest_Fire "Black Forest Fire") of June 2013. Even these fires were exceeded in severity by the [Pine Gulch Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Gulch_Fire "Pine Gulch Fire"), [Cameron Peak Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Peak_Fire "Cameron Peak Fire"), and [East Troublesome Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Troublesome_Fire "East Troublesome Fire") in 2020, all being the three largest fires in Colorado history (see [2020 Colorado wildfires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Colorado_wildfires "2020 Colorado wildfires")). And the Marshall Fire which started on December 30, 2021, while not the largest in state history, was the most destructive ever in terms of property loss (see [Marshall Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Fire "Marshall Fire")).

However, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [Yampa River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yampa_River "Yampa River"), the [Colorado River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River "Colorado River"), the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.

Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

### Climate change

These paragraphs are an excerpt from [Climate change in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Colorado "Climate change in Colorado").

[Climate change in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Colorado "Climate change in Colorado") encompasses the effects of [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"), attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric [carbon dioxide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), in the U.S. state of Colorado.

In 2019 *[The Denver Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denver_Post "The Denver Post")* reported that "\[i\]ndividuals living in southeastern Colorado are more vulnerable to potential health effects from climate change than residents in other parts of the state".[^87] The [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency "United States Environmental Protection Agency") has more broadly reported:

"Colorado's climate is changing. Most of the state has warmed one or two degrees (F) in the last century. Throughout the [western United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States "Western United States"), [heat waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave "Heat wave") are becoming more common, [snow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow") is melting earlier in spring, and less water flows through the Colorado River.[^88][^89] Rising temperatures[^90] and recent droughts[^91] in the region have killed many trees by drying out soils, increasing the risk of forest fires, or enabling outbreaks of forest insects. In the coming decades, the changing climate is likely to decrease water availability and agricultural yields in Colorado, and further increase the risk of [wildfires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire "Wildfire")".[^92]

### Records

The highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115 °F (46.1 °C) on July 20, 2019, at [John Martin Dam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Martin_Reservoir "John Martin Reservoir"). The lowest official air temperature was −61 °F (−51.7 °C) on February 1, 1985, at [Maybell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybell,_Colorado "Maybell, Colorado").[^93][^94]

### Earthquakes

Despite its mountainous terrain, Colorado experiences less seismic activity than states like California and Alaska. There are over 90 potentially active faults, and since 1867, Colorado has experienced 700 recorded earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher.[^97] The U.S. [National Earthquake Information Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Earthquake_Information_Center "National Earthquake Information Center") is located in [Golden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden,_Colorado "Golden, Colorado").[^98]

On August 22, 2011, a [5.3 magnitude earthquake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Colorado_earthquake "2011 Colorado earthquake") occurred 9 miles (14 km) west-southwest of the city of [Trinidad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad,_Colorado "Trinidad, Colorado").[^99] There were no casualties and only a small amount of damage was reported. It was the second-largest earthquake in Colorado's history, the largest being a [magnitude 6.6 earthquake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1882_Fort_Collins_earthquake "1882 Fort Collins earthquake"), recorded in 1882.[^100] Four minor earthquakes rattled Colorado on August 24, 2018, ranging from magnitude 2.9 to 4.3.[^101] As of June 2020, there were 525 recorded earthquakes in Colorado since 1973, a majority of which range 2 to 3.5 on the Richter scale.[^102]

## Fauna

Further information on the lists of: [amphibians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amphibians_of_Colorado "List of amphibians of Colorado"), [birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Colorado "List of birds of Colorado"), [mammals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_of_Colorado "List of mammals of Colorado"), and [reptiles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reptiles_of_Colorado "List of reptiles of Colorado")

Breckenridge naturalist [Edwin Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Carter "Edwin Carter") with a mounted [gray wolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf "Gray wolf") killed in the Colorado Rockies, c. 1890–1900

A process of extirpation by trapping and poisoning of the [gray wolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf "Gray wolf") (*Canis lupus*) from Colorado in the 1930s saw the last wild wolf in the state shot in 1945.[^103] A [wolf pack recolonized Moffat County, Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repopulation_of_wolves_in_Colorado "Repopulation of wolves in Colorado") in northwestern Colorado in 2019.[^104] Cattle farmers have expressed concern that a returning wolf population potentially threatens their herds.[^103] Coloradans [voted to reintroduce gray wolves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Colorado_Proposition_114 "2020 Colorado Proposition 114") in 2020, with the state committing to a plan to have a population in the state by 2022 and permitting non-lethal methods of driving off wolves attacking livestock and pets.[^105][^106]

While there is fossil evidence of [Harrington's mountain goat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrington%27s_mountain_goat "Harrington's mountain goat") in Colorado between at least 800,000 years ago and its extinction with [megafauna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafauna "Megafauna") roughly 11,000 years ago, the [mountain goat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_goat "Mountain goat") is not native to Colorado but was instead introduced to the state over time during the interval between 1947 and 1972. Despite being an artificially-introduced species, the state declared mountain goats a native species in 1993.[^107] In 2013, 2014, and 2019, an unknown illness killed nearly all mountain goat kids, leading to a [Colorado Parks and Wildlife](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife "Colorado Parks and Wildlife") investigation.[^108][^109]

The native population of [pronghorn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronghorn "Pronghorn") in Colorado has varied wildly over the last century, reaching a low of only 15,000 individuals during the 1960s. However, conservation efforts succeeded in bringing the stable population back up to roughly 66,000 by 2013.[^110] The population was estimated to have reached 85,000 by 2019 and had increasingly more run-ins with the increased suburban housing along the eastern Front Range. State wildlife officials suggested that landowners would need to modify fencing to allow the greater number of pronghorns to move unabated through the newly developed land.[^111] Pronghorns are most readily found in the northern and eastern portions of the state, with some populations also in the western San Juan Mountains.[^112]

Common wildlife found in the mountains of Colorado include [mule deer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_deer "Mule deer"), [southwestern red squirrel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_red_squirrel "Southwestern red squirrel"), [golden-mantled ground squirrel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-mantled_ground_squirrel "Golden-mantled ground squirrel"), [yellow-bellied marmot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-bellied_marmot "Yellow-bellied marmot"), [moose](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose "Moose"), [American pika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pika "American pika"), and [red fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox "Red fox"), all at exceptionally high numbers, though moose are not native to the state.[^113][^114][^115][^116] The foothills include [deer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer"), [fox squirrel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_squirrel "Fox squirrel"), [desert cottontail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_cottontail "Desert cottontail"), [mountain cottontail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_cottontail "Mountain cottontail"), and [coyote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote "Coyote").[^117][^118] The prairies are home to [black-tailed prairie dog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-tailed_prairie_dog "Black-tailed prairie dog"), the endangered [swift fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_fox "Swift fox"), [American badger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_badger "American badger"), and [white-tailed jackrabbit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_jackrabbit "White-tailed jackrabbit").[^119][^120][^121]

Like the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado's [state constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_State_of_Colorado "Constitution of the State of Colorado") provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.

The [Governor of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Colorado "Governor of Colorado") heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is [Jared Polis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis "Jared Polis"), a [Democrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)"). Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the [Lieutenant Governor of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Colorado "Lieutenant Governor of Colorado") (elected on a [ticket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_\(election\) "Ticket (election)") with the Governor), [Secretary of State of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Colorado "Secretary of State of Colorado"), [Colorado State Treasurer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_Treasurer "Colorado State Treasurer"), and [Attorney General of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Colorado "Attorney General of Colorado"), all of whom serve four-year terms.

The seven-member [Colorado Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Supreme_Court "Colorado Supreme Court") is the state's highest court. The [Colorado Court of Appeals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Court_of_Appeals "Colorado Court of Appeals"), with 22 judges, sits in divisions of three judges each. Colorado is divided into 23 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The state also has [specialized water courts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_water_courts "Colorado water courts"), which sit in seven distinct divisions around the state and which decide matters relating to water rights and the use and administration of water.

The state legislative body is the [Colorado General Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_General_Assembly "Colorado General Assembly"), which is made up of two houses – the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_House_of_Representatives "Colorado House of Representatives") and the [Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Senate "Colorado Senate"). The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. As of 2023, the [Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") holds a 23 to 12 majority in the Senate and a 46 to 19 majority in the House.

Most Coloradans are native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),[^122] and this is illustrated by the fact that the state did not have a native-born governor from 1975 (when [John David Vanderhoof](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_David_Vanderhoof "John David Vanderhoof") left office) until 2007, when [Bill Ritter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ritter "Bill Ritter") took office; [his election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Colorado_gubernatorial_election "2006 Colorado gubernatorial election") the previous year marked the first electoral victory for a native-born Coloradan in a gubernatorial race since 1958 (Vanderhoof had ascended from the Lieutenant Governorship when [John Arthur Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arthur_Love "John Arthur Love") was given a position in [Richard Nixon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon")'s administration in 1973).

Tax is collected by the [Colorado Department of Revenue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Department_of_Revenue "Colorado Department of Revenue").

Colorado was once considered a [swing state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state "Swing state"), but has become a relatively safe [blue state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states "Red states and blue states") in both state and federal elections since the late 2010s. In presidential elections, it had not been won until [2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Colorado "2020 United States presidential election in Colorado") by double digits since [1984](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election_in_Colorado "1984 United States presidential election in Colorado") and has backed the winning candidate in 9 of the last 11 elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") and 12 [Republicans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)") to the governorship in the last 100 years.

In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state in the 1990s. Since the mid-2000s, it has swung heavily to the Democrats, voting for [Barack Obama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") in 2008 and 2012, [Hillary Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton "Hillary Clinton") in 2016, [Joe Biden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") in 2020, and [Kamala Harris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris "Kamala Harris") in 2024.

Colorado politics exhibits a contrast between conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and Grand Junction, and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [metropolitan Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Metropolitan_Area "Denver Metropolitan Area"), the college towns of [Fort Collins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Collins,_Colorado "Fort Collins, Colorado") and [Boulder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado"), southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and several western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

Colorado is represented by two members of the [United States Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate"):

- [Class 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators#Class_2 "Classes of United States Senators"), [John Hickenlooper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hickenlooper "John Hickenlooper") ( [Democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") ), since 2021

In a 2020 study, Colorado was ranked as the seventh easiest state for citizens to vote in.[^124]

#### Significant initiatives and legislation enacted in Colorado

Colorado was the first state in the union to enact, by voter referendum, [a law extending](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_Colorado_women%27s_suffrage_referendum "1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum")[suffrage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage "Suffrage") to women. That initiative was approved by the state's voters on November 7, 1893.[^125]

On the November 8, 1932, ballot, Colorado approved the [repeal of alcohol prohibition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeal_of_Prohibition "Repeal of Prohibition") more than a year before the [Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution") was ratified.

Colorado has banned, via C.R.S. section 12-6-302, the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday since at least 1953.[^126]

In 1972, Colorado voters rejected a [referendum proposal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Denver_Winter_Olympics_referendum "1972 Denver Winter Olympics referendum") to fund the [1976 Winter Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Winter_Olympics "1976 Winter Olympics"), which had been scheduled to be held in the state. Denver had been chosen by the [International Olympic Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee") as the host city on May 12, 1970.[^127]

In 1992, by a margin of 53 to 47 percent, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize homosexuals or bisexuals as a [protected class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class "Protected class").[^128] In 1996, in a 6–3 ruling in *[Romer v. Evans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romer_v._Evans "Romer v. Evans")*, the U.S. Supreme Court found that preventing protected status based upon homosexuality or [bisexuality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality "Bisexuality") did not satisfy the [Equal Protection Clause](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause "Equal Protection Clause").[^129]

In 2006, voters passed [Amendment 43](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Colorado_Amendment_43 "2006 Colorado Amendment 43"), which banned [same-sex marriage in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Colorado "Same-sex marriage in Colorado").[^130] That initiative was nullified by the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States")'s 2015 decision in *[Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges "Obergefell v. Hodges")*. In 2024, Colorado residents voted to establish an explicit right to [abortion in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Colorado "Abortion in Colorado")'s state constitution[^131][^132] and to repeal Amendment 43's defunct marriage ban.[^133][^134]

In 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting the "personal use" of marijuana for adults, establishing a framework to regulate [cannabis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_\(drug\) "Cannabis (drug)") like [alcohol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage "Alcoholic beverage"). The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.[^135]

On 30 October 2019, Colorado became the first state to accept digital ID via its myColorado app.[^136] The state-issued digital identifications will be considered valid when Real ID enforcement begins in 2025, in line with the [Real ID Act of 2005](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_ID_Act "Real ID Act"). By November 2022 The Colorado Governor's Office of Information Technology announced that the myColorado app had over 1 million users.[^137]

On December 19, 2023, the [Colorado Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Supreme_Court "Colorado Supreme Court") ruled that [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") was disqualified from the [2024 United States presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election "2024 United States presidential election") in part due to his alleged incitement of the [January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack "January 6 United States Capitol attack").[^138] On March 4, 2024, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court "United States Supreme Court")[overruled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Anderson "Trump v. Anderson") the Colorado decision.[^139]

Main article: [List of counties in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Colorado "List of counties in Colorado")

The State of Colorado is divided into 64 [counties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_\(United_States\) "County (United States)"). Two of these counties, the [City and County of Broomfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broomfield,_Colorado "Broomfield, Colorado") and the [City and County of Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver "Denver"), have [consolidated city and county governments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_city-county "Consolidated city-county"). Counties are important units of government in Colorado since there are no [civil townships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township "Civil township") or other [minor civil divisions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_civil_division "Minor civil division").

The most populous county in Colorado is [El Paso County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso_County,_Colorado "El Paso County, Colorado"), the home of the [City of Colorado Springs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado "Colorado Springs, Colorado"). The second most populous county is the [City and County of Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver "Denver"), the state capital. Five of the 64 counties now have more than 500,000 residents, while 12 have fewer than 5,000 residents. The ten most populous Colorado counties are all located in the [Front Range Urban Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range_Urban_Corridor "Front Range Urban Corridor"). [Mesa County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_County,_Colorado "Mesa County, Colorado") is the most populous county on the [Colorado Western Slope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Western_Slope "Colorado Western Slope").[^4]

Some of these districts have the authority to levy sales tax as well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:

- The [Regional Transportation District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Transportation_District "Regional Transportation District") (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties

These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement, or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history, or cultural history.
	- As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three "tiers" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
		- Tier I includes regional organizations: the [Denver Art Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Art_Museum "Denver Art Museum"), the [Denver Botanic Gardens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Botanic_Gardens "Denver Botanic Gardens"), the [Denver Museum of Nature and Science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Museum_of_Nature_and_Science "Denver Museum of Nature and Science"), the [Denver Zoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Zoo "Denver Zoo"), and the [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts "Denver Center for the Performing Arts"). It receives 65.5%.
		- Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
		- Tier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding from the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
	- An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions by the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
- The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [Denver Broncos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos "Denver Broncos") ' stadium [Empower Field at Mile High](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empower_Field_at_Mile_High "Empower Field at Mile High").

Ethnic origins in Colorado

Map of counties in Colorado by racial plurality, per the 2020 U.S. censusLegend

[Coloradan Hispanics and Latinos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanics_and_Latinos_in_Colorado "Hispanics and Latinos in Colorado") (of any race and heritage) made up 20.7% of the population.[^153] According to the 2000 census, the largest ancestry groups in Colorado are [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Americans "German Americans") (22%), [Mexican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Americans "Mexican Americans") (18%), [Irish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans "Irish Americans") (12%), and [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Americans "English Americans") (12%). Persons reporting German ancestry are especially numerous in the Front Range, the Rockies (west-central counties), and Eastern parts/High Plains.

Colorado has a high proportion of [Hispanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic "Hispanic"), mostly [Mexican-American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American "Mexican-American"), citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and elsewhere. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado have a large number of Hispanos, the descendants of the early settlers of colonial Spanish origin. In 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Colorado's population as 8.2% Hispanic and 90.3% non-Hispanic White.[^154] The Hispanic population of Colorado has continued to grow quickly over the past decades. By 2019, Hispanics made up 22% of Colorado's population, and [Non-Hispanic Whites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_White "Non-Hispanic White") made up 70%.[^155] Spoken English in Colorado has many Spanish idioms.[^156]

Colorado also has some large African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. The state has sizable numbers of Asian-Americans of [Mongolian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_American "Mongolian American"), [Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_American "Chinese American"), [Filipino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_American "Filipino American"), [Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_American "Korean American"), [Southeast Asian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian "Southeast Asian"), and [Japanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American "Japanese American") descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.

The population of Native Americans in the state is small. Native Americans are concentrated in metropolitan Denver and the southwestern corner of Colorado, where there are two Ute reservations.[^157]

The majority of Colorado's immigrants are from [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), [India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [Vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam"), [Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "Korea"), [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") and [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada").[^158]

There were a total of 70,331 births in Colorado in 2006. (Birth rate of 14.6 per thousand.) In 2007, non-Hispanic Whites were involved in 59.1% of all births.[^159] Some 14.06% of those births involved a non-Hispanic White person and someone of a different race, most often with a couple including one Hispanic. A birth where at least one Hispanic person was involved counted for 43% of the births in Colorado.[^160] As of the [2010 census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_census "2010 United States census"), Colorado has the seventh highest percentage of Hispanics (20.7%) in the U.S. behind [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico") (46.3%), California (37.6%), [Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas") (37.6%), [Arizona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona") (29.6%), [Nevada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada "Nevada") (26.5%), and Florida (22.5%). Per the 2000 census, the Hispanic population is estimated to be 918,899, or approximately 20% of the state's total population. Colorado has the 5th-largest population of Mexican-Americans, behind California, Texas, Arizona, and [Illinois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois "Illinois"). In percentages, Colorado has the 6th-highest percentage of Mexican-Americans, behind New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.[^161]

### Birth data

In 2011, 46% of Colorado's population younger than the age of one were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic White.[^162][^163]

*Note: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.*

## Health

Colorado is generally considered among the healthiest states by behavioral and healthcare researchers. Among the positive contributing factors is the state's well-known outdoor recreation opportunities and initiatives.[^187] However, there is a stratification of health metrics with wealthier counties such as [Douglas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Colorado "Douglas County, Colorado") and [Pitkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitkin_County,_Colorado "Pitkin County, Colorado") performing significantly better relative to southern, less wealthy counties such as [Huerfano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huerfano_County,_Colorado "Huerfano County, Colorado") and [Las Animas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Animas_County,_Colorado "Las Animas County, Colorado").[^188]

Several nationally known brand names have originated in Colorado factories and laboratories. From [Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver#Economy "Denver") came the forerunner of telecommunications giant [Qwest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwest_Corporation "Qwest Corporation") in 1879, [Samsonite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsonite "Samsonite") luggage in 1910, [Gates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_Corporation "Gates Corporation") belts and hoses in 1911, and [Russell Stover Candies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Stover_Candies "Russell Stover Candies") in 1923. Kuner canned vegetables began in [Brighton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton,_Colorado "Brighton, Colorado") in 1864. From [Golden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden,_Colorado "Golden, Colorado") came [Coors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Brewing_Company "Coors Brewing Company") beer in 1873, [CoorsTek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoorsTek "CoorsTek") industrial ceramics in 1920, and [Jolly Rancher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Rancher "Jolly Rancher") candy in 1949. [CF&I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Fuel_and_Iron "Colorado Fuel and Iron") railroad rails, wire, nails, and pipe debuted in [Pueblo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo,_Colorado "Pueblo, Colorado") in 1892.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [income tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax "Income tax"), regardless of income level. On 3 November 2020 voters authorized an initiative to lower that income tax rate to 4.55 percent. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal *adjusted gross income*, Colorado taxes are based on *taxable income*—income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.[^202][^203] Colorado's state [sales tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax "Sales tax") is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, according to Colorado's [Taxpayer Bill of Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayer_Bill_of_Rights "Taxpayer Bill of Rights") legislation, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates, in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

Real estate and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break was scheduled to return for the assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

As of December 2018, the state's unemployment rate was 4.2%.[^204]

### Agriculture

[Corn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn "Corn") is grown in the [Eastern Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Plains "Eastern Plains") of Colorado. Arid conditions and drought negatively impacted yields in 2020[^206] and 2022.[^207]

### Natural resources

An [oil well](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_well "Oil well") in western Colorado

Colorado has significant [hydrocarbon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon "Hydrocarbon") resources. According to the [Energy Information Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration "Energy Information Administration"), Colorado hosts seven of the largest natural gas fields in the United States, and two of the largest [oil fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_field "Oil field"). Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically accounts for more than five percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado's [oil shale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_shale "Oil shale") deposits hold an estimated 1 trillion barrels (160 km<sup>3</sup>) of oil—nearly as much oil as the entire world's proven oil reserves.[^208] Substantial deposits of [bituminous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bituminous_coal "Bituminous coal"), [subbituminous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-bituminous_coal "Sub-bituminous coal"), and [lignite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignite "Lignite") coal are found in the state.

[Uranium mining in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining_in_Colorado "Uranium mining in Colorado") goes back to 1872, when pitchblende ore was taken from gold mines near Central City, Colorado. Not counting byproduct uranium from [phosphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate "Phosphate"), Colorado is considered to have the third-largest uranium reserves of any U.S. state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico. When Colorado and Utah dominated [radium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium") mining from 1910 to 1922, uranium and [vanadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium "Vanadium") were the byproducts (giving towns like present-day [Superfund site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfund_site "Superfund site")[Uravan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uravan,_Colorado "Uravan, Colorado") their names).[^209] Uranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted several companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. During the 1940s certain communities–including [Naturita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturita,_Colorado "Naturita, Colorado") and [Paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox,_Colorado "Paradox, Colorado")–earned the moniker of "[yellowcake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowcake "Yellowcake") towns" from their relationship with uranium mining. Price drops and financing problems in late 2008 forced these companies to cancel or scale back the uranium-mining project. As of 2016, there were no major uranium mining operations in the state, though plans existed to restart production.[^210]

Colorado is home to many nationally praised [microbreweries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbreweries "Microbreweries"),[^227] including [New Belgium Brewing Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Belgium_Brewing_Company "New Belgium Brewing Company"), [Odell Brewing Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Brewing_Company "Odell Brewing Company"),and [Great Divide Brewing Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divide_Brewing_Company "Great Divide Brewing Company"). The area of northern Colorado near and between the cities of Denver, [Boulder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado"), and [Fort Collins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Collins "Fort Collins") is known as the "Napa Valley of Beer" due to its high density of [craft breweries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft_breweries "Craft breweries").[^228]

### Marijuana and hemp

Colorado is open to [cannabis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_\(drug\) "Cannabis (drug)") (marijuana) [tourism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use "Recreational drug use").[^229] With the adoption of the [64th state amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Amendment_64 "Colorado Amendment 64") in 2012, Colorado became the first state in the union to [legalize marijuana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction "Legality of cannabis by U.S. jurisdiction") for [medicinal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States "Medical cannabis in the United States") (2000), industrial (referring to [hemp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp "Hemp"), 2012), and [recreational](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Colorado_Amendment_64 "2012 Colorado Amendment 64") (2012) use. Colorado's marijuana industry sold $1.31 billion worth of marijuana in 2016 and $1.26 billion in the first three-quarters of 2017.[^230] The state generated tax, fee, and license revenue of $194 million in 2016 on legal marijuana sales.[^231] Colorado regulates hemp as any part of the plant with less than 0.3% THC.[^232]

On April 4, 2014, Senate Bill 14–184 addressing oversight of Colorado's industrial hemp program was first introduced, ultimately being signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper on May 31, 2014.[^233]

#### Medicinal use

On November 7, 2000, 54% of Colorado voters passed Amendment 20, which amends the Colorado State constitution to allow the [medical use of marijuana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_use_of_cannabis "Medical use of cannabis").[^234] A patient's medical use of marijuana, within the following limits, is lawful:

- (I) No more than 2 ounces (57 g) of a usable form of marijuana; and
- (II) No more than twelve marijuana plants, with six or fewer being mature, flowering plants that are producing a usable form of marijuana.[^235]

Currently, Colorado has listed "eight medical conditions for which patients can use marijuana—cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, muscle spasms, seizures, severe pain, severe nausea and cachexia, or dramatic weight loss and muscle atrophy".[^236] While governor, [John Hickenlooper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hickenlooper "John Hickenlooper") allocated about half of the state's $13 million "Medical Marijuana Program Cash Fund"[^237] to medical research in the 2014 budget.[^238] By 2018, the Medical Marijuana Program Cash Fund was the "largest pool of pot money in the state" and was used to fund programs including research into pediatric applications for controlling autism symptoms.[^239]

#### Recreational use

On November 6, 2012, voters amended the state constitution to protect "personal use" of marijuana for adults, establishing a framework to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to [alcohol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_\(drug\) "Alcohol (drug)").[^240] The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.[^135]

## Transportation

Main article: [Transportation in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_in_Colorado "Transportation in Colorado")

A Colorado state welcome sign

Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [Interstate 25](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_25_in_Colorado "Interstate 25 in Colorado") (I-25) is the primary north–south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. [I-70](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70_in_Colorado "Interstate 70 in Colorado") is the primary east–west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Many smaller communities are connected to this network only via county roads.

The main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the [Front Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range "Front Range").

[Denver International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_International_Airport "Denver International Airport") (DIA) is the third-busiest domestic U.S. and [international airport in the world by passenger traffic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic "World's busiest airports by passenger traffic").[^241] DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States.

Public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's RTD services. The [Regional Transportation District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Transportation_District "Regional Transportation District") (RTD) operates the popular [RTD Bus & Rail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTD_Bus_%26_Rail "RTD Bus & Rail") transit system in the [Denver Metropolitan Area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Metropolitan_Area "Denver Metropolitan Area"). As of January 2013 the RTD rail system had 170 light-rail vehicles, serving 47 miles (76 km) of track. In addition to local public transit, intercity bus service is provided by [Burlington Trailways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington_Trailways "Burlington Trailways"), [Bustang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustang "Bustang") and [Greyhound Lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound_Lines "Greyhound Lines").

The westbound and eastbound *[California Zephyrs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Zephyr "California Zephyr")* meet in the [Glenwood Canyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenwood_Canyon "Glenwood Canyon").

[Amtrak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak "Amtrak") operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the *[California Zephyr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Zephyr "California Zephyr")* and *[Southwest Chief](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Chief "Southwest Chief")*. Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_and_Rio_Grande_Western_Railroad "Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad") which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the "Rio Grande" was acquired, but was merged into, the [Southern Pacific Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad "Southern Pacific Railroad") by their joint owner [Philip Anschutz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Anschutz "Philip Anschutz"). On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [Union Pacific Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Railroad "Union Pacific Railroad"), creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.

Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.[^242]

In August 2014, Colorado began to issue driver licenses to [aliens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(law\) "Alien (law)")[not lawfully in the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States "Illegal immigration to the United States") who lived in Colorado.[^243] In September 2014, [KCNC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCNC "KCNC") reported that 524 non-citizens were issued Colorado driver licenses that are normally issued to U.S. citizens living in Colorado.[^244]

## Education

Main articles: [List of colleges and universities in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Colorado "List of colleges and universities in Colorado") and [List of high schools in Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high_schools_in_Colorado "List of high schools in Colorado")See also: [Table of Colorado school districts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Colorado_school_districts "Table of Colorado school districts"), [Table of Colorado charter schools](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Colorado_charter_schools "Table of Colorado charter schools"), and [Auraria Campus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auraria_Campus "Auraria Campus")

The first institution of [higher education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_the_United_States "Higher education in the United States") in the Colorado Territory was the [Colorado Seminary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Seminary "Colorado Seminary"), opened on November 16, 1864, by the [Methodist Episcopal Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church "Methodist Episcopal Church"). The seminary closed in 1867 but reopened in 1880 as the [University of Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Denver "University of Denver"). In 1870, the Bishop [George Maxwell Randall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Randall_\(bishop\) "George M. Randall (bishop)") of the [Episcopal Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_\(United_States\) "Episcopal Church (United States)")'s [Missionary District of Colorado and Parts Adjacent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Diocese_of_Colorado "Episcopal Diocese of Colorado") opened the first of what become the [Colorado University Schools](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_University_Schools "Colorado University Schools") which would include the [Territorial School of Mines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_School_of_Mines "Colorado School of Mines") opened in 1873 and sold to the Colorado Territory in 1874. These schools were initially run by the Episcopal Church.[^245] An 1861 territorial act called for the creation of a public university in Boulder, though it would not be until 1876 that the [University of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder "University of Colorado Boulder") was founded.[^246] The 1876 act also renamed Territorial School of Mines as the [Colorado School of Mines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_School_of_Mines "Colorado School of Mines").[^247] An 1870 territorial act created the [Agricultural College of Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University "Colorado State University") which opened in 1879.[^248] The college was renamed the [Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University "Colorado State University") in 1935, and became [Colorado State University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University "Colorado State University") in 1957.

The first [Catholic college](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States "List of Catholic universities and colleges in the United States") in Colorado was the [Jesuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus "Society of Jesus") Sacred Heart College, which was founded in New Mexico in 1877, moved to [Morrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison,_Colorado "Morrison, Colorado") in 1884, and to Denver in 1887. The college was renamed Regis College in 1921 and [Regis University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_University "Regis University") in 1991.[^249] On April 1, 1924, armed students patrolled the campus after a [burning cross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_burning "Cross burning") was found, the climax of tensions between Regis College and the locally-powerful Ku Klux Klan.[^250]

Following a 1950 assessment by the Service Academy Board, it was determined that there was a need to supplement the [U.S. Military](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Military_Academy "U.S. Military Academy") and [Naval Academies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Naval_Academy "U.S. Naval Academy") with a third school that would provide commissioned officers for the newly independent Air Force. On April 1, 1954, President [Dwight Eisenhower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower "Dwight Eisenhower") signed a law that moved for the creation of a [U.S. Air Force Academy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force_Academy "U.S. Air Force Academy").[^251] Later that year, Colorado Springs was selected to host the new institution. From its establishment in 1955, until the construction of appropriate facilities in Colorado Springs was completed and opened in 1958, the Air Force Academy operated out of [Lowry Air Force Base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowry_Air_Force_Base "Lowry Air Force Base") in Denver. With the opening of the Colorado Springs facility, the cadets moved to the new campus, though not in the full-kit march that some urban and campus legends suggest.[^252] The first class of [Space Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force "United States Space Force")[officers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_\(armed_forces\) "Officer (armed forces)") from the Air Force Academy commissioned on April 18, 2020.[^253]

## Indigenous People

The two [Native American reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation") remaining in Colorado are the [Southern Ute Indian Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ute_Indian_Reservation "Southern Ute Indian Reservation") (1873; [Ute dialect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_dialect "Ute dialect"): *Kapuuta-wa Moghwachi Núuchi-u*) and [Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_Mountain_Ute_Indian_Reservation "Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation") (1940; [Ute dialect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_dialect "Ute dialect"): *Wʉgama Núuchi*).

The two abolished Indian reservations in Colorado were the [Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_and_Arapaho_Tribes "Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes") (1851–1870) and [Ute Indian Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_Indian_Reservation "Ute Indian Reservation") (1855–1873).
