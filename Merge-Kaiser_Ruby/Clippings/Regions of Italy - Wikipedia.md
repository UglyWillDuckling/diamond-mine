The **regions of Italy** ([Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): *regioni d'Italia*) are the first-level [administrative divisions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_division "Administrative division") of the [Italian Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), constituting its second [NUTS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics "Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics") administrative level.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-eurostat-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> There are twenty regions, [five of which are autonomous regions with special status](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Autonomous_regions_with_special_statute). Under the [Constitution of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy "Constitution of Italy"), each region is an autonomous entity with defined powers. With the exception of the [Aosta Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aosta_Valley "Aosta Valley") (since 1945), each region is divided into a number of [provinces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Italy "Provinces of Italy").
