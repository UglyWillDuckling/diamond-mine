[[Joseph Konrad]]
> Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski was born on **December 3, 1857**, in a Polish province in the Ukraine to parents ardently opposed to the Russian occupation of eastern Poland. From his father, **Apollo**, Conrad developed a great love of literature, and he read the works of James Fen imore Cooper, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Sir Walter Scott in Polish and French translations. After he lost his parents to tuberculosis in 1865 and 1869, Conrad was cared for by his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski until **1874, when he left for Marseilles to launch a career at sea that would span some twenty years**. ==He joined the British merchant marine in 1878==, climbing the ranks and passing his captain’s exam in **1886**—the same year he became a British subject. Conrad’s many ocean voyages took him all over the world and provided inspiration for his subsequent writing career, but it was his trip up the ==Congo River== on a **steamship** that left him <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disenchanted with humanity</mark> and that led him to write his seminal work [[Heart of Darkness]] (**1899**). Conrad had begun a decade earlier, at age thirty-one, to compose fiction in English, a language he had not learned until he was a young adult. He published his first novel, Almayer’s Folly,in 1895 under the pen name Joseph Conrad and, encouraged by the literary critic [[Edward Garnett]], then devoted himself to writing. Although he suffered from physical ailments, such as [[malaria]], as well as psychological problems, Conrad nonetheless produced a substantial body of work, including the great novels Lord Jim (1900), Nostromo (1904), The Secret Agent (1907), and Under Western Eyes (1911). **He is regarded as one of the premier prose stylists and writers of [[psychological fiction]] in the English language**. He died of a heart attack on August 3, 1924.
