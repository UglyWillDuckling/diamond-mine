**Jellyfin** is a [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source "Open-source") [media server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_server "Media server") and [suite of multimedia applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_suite "Software suite") designed to organize, manage, and share digital media files to [networked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") devices. Jellyfin consists of a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_\(computing\) "Server (computing)") application installed on a machine running [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS"), [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") or in a [Docker container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_\(software\) "Docker (software)"),[^2] and another application running on a client device such as a [smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone"), [tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer "Tablet computer"), [smart TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV "Smart TV"), [streaming media player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media_player "Digital media player"), [game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_console "Game console") or in a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser").[^3] Jellyfin also can serve media to [DLNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLNA "DLNA") and [Chromecast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast "Chromecast")\-enabled devices.[^4] It is a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_\(software_development\) "Fork (software development)") of [Emby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emby "Emby").[^5]

Jellyfin follows a [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") that allows for multiple users and clients to connect and stream digital media [remotely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleoperation "Teleoperation"). Because Jellyfin runs as a fully self-contained server, there is no [subscription-based consumption model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model "Subscription business model") that exists, and Jellyfin does not [utilize an external connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoning_home "Phoning home") nor third-party authentication for this functionality. This enables Jellyfin to work on an isolated [intranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet "Intranet") in much the same fashion as it does over the Internet. Because it shares a heritage with Emby, some clients for that platform are unofficially compatible with Jellyfin; however, as Jellyfin's [codebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase "Codebase") diverges from Emby, this becomes less possible. Jellyfin does not support a direct migration path from Emby.[^6]

Jellyfin is [extensible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_programming "Extensible programming"), and optional third-party [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_\(computing\) "Plug-in (computing)") exist to provide additional feature functionality. The project hosts an official [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository "Software repository"), however plugins need not be hosted in the official repository to be installable.[^7]

Version 10.6.0 of the server software introduced a feature known as "SyncPlay", which provides functionality for multiple users to consume media content together in a synchronized fashion. Support to read [epub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB "EPUB")\-format [ebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebooks "Ebooks") with Jellyfin was also added. Support for third-party plugin repositories was also added, allowing users to create and install plugins without the need for the official plugin repository. The web front end has been split off in a separate system in anticipation of the move towards a [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL "SQL") backend and [High Availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability "High availability") with multiple servers.[^8]

The project began on December 8, 2018, when co-founders Andrew Rabert and Joshua Boniface, among other users, agreed to fork Emby as a direct reaction to closing of [open-source development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development "Open-source software development") on that project.[^9][^10][^11][^12] A reference to streaming, Jellyfin's name was conceived of by Rabert the following day.[^13] An initial release was made available on December 30, 2018.

Jellyfin's unique version numbering began with version 10.0.0 in January 2019.
