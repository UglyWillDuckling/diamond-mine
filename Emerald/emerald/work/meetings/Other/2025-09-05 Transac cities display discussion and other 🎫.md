## who?

`=this.participants`

## why?

It is unclear what [[Vincent Dibiaggio]] wants to be shown and how.

## what?

Discuss about displaying cities on the transac page. The best would be to develop a concrete specification, maybe 80-90 percent complete. The rest can be be filled in as we  go and development progresses.

## notes 🗒

- not sure on the timeline for this 🤔

## discussion 🗨

### transac cities
https://avivgroup.atlassian.net/browse/TIB-90

- [x] what do we need to display and where?
	- city ids
	- search bar to search for a city instead of iris
- [x] why is this important?
- [x] what functionality is needed?
	- filtering, sorting
		- sorting by city name
	- search
		- by name and id
	- ~~other interactions,manipulations~~

**we need to see cities**.

do we need to change the review: **yes**
🎫
- it's good that it's separated into 2 lists
- **one city to many iris_ids**
- just `display` the cities
- we can leave entering by iris_id for now

- ideally we would add city ids
