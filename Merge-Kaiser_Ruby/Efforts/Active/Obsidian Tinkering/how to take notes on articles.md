### how to take notes

the best seems to be to take them in the same file. This is best for videos as they aren't taking any space on the page.

For **articles** you can read them and highlight them and add comments as well.

After you're done, you can make a **new note** based on what you just read. This seems the most beneficial way of understanding and remembering something.

:LiNotebookPen: you can make helper notes as well to quickly capture a piece of information that you might find useful later Independent of the article processing/reading/understaind itself.
