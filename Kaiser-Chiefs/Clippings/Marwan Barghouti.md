**Marwan Barghouti** (also transliterated **al-Barghuthi**; [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): مروان البرغوثي; born 6 June 1959) is a Palestinian political leader convicted and imprisoned for his role in deadly attacks against Israel.[^bbcprofile-1] He is regarded as a leader of the [First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada "First Intifada") and [Second Intifadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada "Second Intifada"). Barghouti at one time supported the [peace process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel-Palestine_peace_process "Israel-Palestine peace process"), but later became disillusioned after 2000, becoming a leader of [Tanzim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzim "Tanzim"), a paramilitary offshoot of [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah").[^2][^3]

Barghouti was born in the village of [Kobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobar "Kobar") in the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") in 1959. At the age of 15, he joined [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah") and co-founded its Youth Movement, and was consequently arrested by Israel three years later. During his four-year first imprisonment, Barghouthi completed his secondary education and gained fluency in Hebrew. In 1983, Barghouti enrolled at the [Birzeit University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birzeit_University "Birzeit University") and gained his B.A. in History and Political Science in 1994, earning soon after an M.A. in International Relations in 1998. In 1984, Barghouthi married a fellow student, [Fadwa Ibrahim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadwa_Ibrahim "Fadwa Ibrahim"), a prominent advocate for Palestinian prisoners, who later became the leading campaigner for her husband's release during his current imprisonment.

Israeli authorities have called Barghouti a terrorist, accusing him of directing numerous attacks, including suicide bombings, against civilian and military targets alike.[^mfa.gov.il-4] Barghouti was arrested by [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") in 2002 in [Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah "Ramallah").[^bbcprofile-1] He was tried and convicted on charges of murder, and sentenced to five life sentences. Marwan Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. Barghouti still exerts great influence in Fatah from within prison.[^5] With popularity reaching further than that, there has been some speculation whether he could be a unifying candidate in a bid to succeed [Mahmoud Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas "Mahmoud Abbas").[^6]

In the negotiations over the exchange of [Palestinian prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_prisoners "Palestinian prisoners") for the captured Israeli soldier [Gilad Shalit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit "Gilad Shalit"), Hamas insisted on including Barghouti in the deal with Israel;[^7][^haaretz1-8] however, Israel was unwilling to concede to that demand. Despite initial reports that he was going to be released in the 11 October 2011 deal between Israel and Hamas, it was soon denied by Israeli sources.[^9][^10] In November 2014, Barghouti urged the [Palestinian Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority "Palestinian Authority") to immediately end security cooperation with [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") and called for a [Third Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Intifada "Silent Intifada") against Israel.[^11]

## Biography

Barghouti was born in the village of [Kobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobar "Kobar") near [Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah "Ramallah"), and comes from the [Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barghouti_family "Barghouti family") clan, an extended family from [Deir Ghassaneh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Ghassaneh "Deir Ghassaneh"). [Mustafa Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti "Mustafa Barghouti"), a fellow Palestinian political figure, is a distant cousin. Barghouti was one of seven children, and his father was a migrant worker in Lebanon. His younger brother Muqbel described him as "a naughty and rebellious boy".[^nytbennet-12]

Barghouti joined Fatah at age 15,[^bbcprofile-1] and he was a co-founder of the Fatah Youth Movement (Shabiba) on the West Bank. By the age of 18 in 1976, Barghouti was arrested by Israel for his involvement with Palestinian militant groups. He completed his secondary education and received a high school diploma while serving a four-year term in jail, where he gained fluency in Hebrew.[^hajjar-13]

Barghouti enrolled at [Birzeit University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birzeit_University "Birzeit University") (BZU) in 1983, though arrest and exile meant that he did not receive his B.A. (History and Political Science) until 1994. He earned an M.A. in International Relations, also from Birzeit, in 1998. As an undergraduate, he was active in student politics on behalf of Fatah and headed the BZU Student Council. On 21 October 1984, he married a fellow student, [Fadwa Ibrahim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadwa_Ibrahim "Fadwa Ibrahim"). Fadwa took bachelor's and master's degrees in law and was a prominent advocate in her own right on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, before becoming the leading campaigner for her husband's release from his current jail term. The couple has a daughter, Ruba (born 1986), and three sons, Qassam (born 1985), Sharaf (born 1989) and Arab (born 1990).

## [[First Intifada]], the [[Oslo Accords]] and the aftermath

Barghouti became one of the major leaders in the West Bank of the [First Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada "First Intifada") in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation.[^bbcprofile-1] During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") for incitement,[^hajjar-13] where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords") in 1994.[^bbcprofile-1]

Although he was a strong supporter of the peace process he doubted that Israel was committed to land-for-peace deals.[^bbcprofile-1][^usherbarghouti1994-14] In 1996, he was elected to the [Palestinian Legislative Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council "Palestinian Legislative Council"),[^bbcprofile-1] following which he began his active advocacy of the establishment of an independent [Palestinian state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_state "Palestinian state"). Barghouti campaigned against corruption in Arafat's administration and human rights violations by its security services, and he established relationships with a number of Israeli politicians and members of Israel's peace movement.[^bbcprofile-1] The formal position occupied by Barghouti was Secretary-General of Fatah in the West Bank.[^kelly-15] By the summer of 2000, particularly after the Camp David summit failed, Barghouti was disillusioned and said that popular protests and "new forms of military struggle" would be features of the "next Intifada".[^bbcprofile-1][^hajjar-13]

## Second Intifada

### Tanzim leadership

In September 2000, the [Second Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada "Second Intifada") began. Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah armed branch, the [Tanzim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzim "Tanzim"), seen as one of the major forces fighting against the [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces"). Barghouti led marches to Israeli checkpoints, where riots broke out against Israeli soldiers and spurred on Palestinians in speeches at funerals and demonstrations, advocating the use of force to expel Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[^bbcprofile-1] He has stated that, "I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom" and has said, "I still seek peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine based on full withdrawal from Palestinian territories occupied in 1967."[^wp-oped-20020116-16]

As the Palestinian death toll in the Second Intifada increased, Barghouti called for Palestinians to target Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.[^hajjar-13] During the second intifada Barghouti was accused by Israel of being a senior member of the [Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Martyrs%27_Brigades "Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades"), an organization which conducted numerous attacks and suicide bombings on civilians both within and outside of Israel proper,[^bbcprofile-17] and has been accused of having directed some of these bombings personally.[^bbcprofile-17][^navonmfareport-18] While some Palestinian militants advocated adopting tactics based on those used by Hezbollah to drive the Israeli army out of Lebanon, Barghouti was seen as less radical, supporting violent actions based on popular movements but exclusively within the Palestinian territories.[^19]

According to [National Public Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio "National Public Radio"), Barghouti "cut his ideological teeth as the political leader of Fatah's armed militant wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.[^westervelt-20]

### Israeli trial and imprisonment

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%9F_28.jpg/220px-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%9F_28.jpg)

Barghouti being arrested by Israeli soldiers in Ramallah during [Operation Defensive Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Defensive_Shield "Operation Defensive Shield")

Israel accused him of founding the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and attempted to assassinate him in 2001.[^bbcprofile-1] The missile hit his bodyguard's car, killing the bodyguard.[^bbcprofile-1] Barghouti survived but was arrested by the [Israeli Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Army "Israeli Army") in [Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah "Ramallah"), on 15 April 2002 and transferred to the '[Russian Compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Compound "Russian Compound")' police station in Jerusalem.

Amos Harel wrote in *[Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")* that Barghouti was arrested by soldiers of the [Duchifat Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchifat_Battalion "Duchifat Battalion") who had approached the building hidden in an ambulance to avoid detection: "The Duchifat soldiers were squeezed into a protected ambulance in order to arrive as quickly as possible at the house where Barghouti was hiding, and to seal it off."[^21]

Several months later, he was indicted in an Israeli civilian court on 26 charges of murder and attempted murder stemming from attacks carried out by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades on Israeli civilians and soldiers.[^22][^mfa.gov.il-4]

Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate.[^medea-23] The Israeli verdict against him in effect removed Arafat's only political rival.[^24] Barghouti stressed that he supported armed resistance to the [Israeli occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories "Israeli-occupied territories"), but condemned attacks on civilians inside Israel. According to the case argued by Israel at his trial, he had supported and authorized such attacks.[^25] On 20 May 2004, he was convicted of five counts of murder: authorizing and organizing the [murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Georgios_Tsibouktzakis "Murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis") (aka Father Germanos, a [Greek Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox "Greek Orthodox") monk-priest), a shooting adjacent to [Giv'at Ze'ev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giv%27at_Ze%27ev "Giv'at Ze'ev") in which a civilian was killed, and the [Seafood Market attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood_Market_attack "Seafood Market attack") in [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv") in which three civilians were killed. In addition, he was convicted of attempted murder for a failed [car bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_bomb "Car bomb") attack near [Malha Mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malha_Mall "Malha Mall") that exploded prematurely, resulting in the deaths of two suicide bombers, and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. He was acquitted of 21 counts of murder in 33 other attacks as no proof was brought to link Barghouti directly with the specific decisions of the local leadership of the Tanzim to carry out these particular attacks.[^26] On 6 June 2004, he was sentenced to the maximum possible punishment for his convictions: five cumulative life sentences for the murders and an additional 40 years, consisting of 20 years each for attempted murder and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization.

The [Inter-Parliamentary Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union "Inter-Parliamentary Union") reviewed the case and released a report that criticized Barghouti's arrest, treatment while in detention, and trial. It said his rights were violated and international treaties and norms were contravened.[^foreman-27][^28]

### Campaign for release

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Kufr_ad-Deek.protest.4.JPG/250px-Kufr_ad-Deek.protest.4.JPG)

A portrait of Marwan Barghouti at a demonstration at [Kafr ad-Dik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_ad-Dik "Kafr ad-Dik").

Since Barghouti's arrest, many of his supporters have campaigned for his release. They include prominent Palestinian figures, members of European Parliament and the Israeli group [Gush Shalom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Shalom "Gush Shalom"). [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters "Reuters") reported that some see Barghouti "as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, the man who could galvanize a drifting and divided national movement if only he were set free by Israel".[^r20091119-29] According to *The Jerusalem Post*, "\[u\]nlike many in the Western media, Palestinian journalists and writers have rarely - if ever - referred to Barghouti as...the 'Palestinian Nelson Mandela.'"[^jp20091126-30]

Another approach is to suggest that Israel's freeing of Barghouti would be an excellent show of good faith in the peace process. This view gained popularity among the Israeli left after the 2005 [disengagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan "Israel's unilateral disengagement plan") from the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"). Still others, operating from a [realpolitik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik "Realpolitik") perspective, have pointed out that allowing Barghouti to re-enter Palestinian politics could serve to bolster Fatah against gains in [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")' popularity.[^31] According to [Pinhas Inbari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhas_Inbari "Pinhas Inbari") of the [Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Center_for_Public_Affairs "Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs"),

> "Hamas understands it needs to provide its supporters with some comfort, especially seeing the suffering of the Palestinian people. For this reason, Hamas is willing to accept Barghouti's release and to deal with him after he is free. Without the severe state of the Palestinian people, Hamas would object to the release of Barghouti."[^32]

Following Barghouti's January 2006 re-election to the [Palestinian Legislative Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council "Palestinian Legislative Council"), a debate over Barghouti's fate began anew in Israel, ranging from former MK [Yossi Beilin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossi_Beilin "Yossi Beilin") support for a Presidential pardon to the total refusal of any idea of early release. Israeli Foreign Minister [Silvan Shalom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvan_Shalom "Silvan Shalom") stated,

> "We must not forget that he is a cold-blooded murderer who was sentenced by the court to five life sentences… It is out of the question to free an assassin who has blood on his hands and was duly sentenced by a court."[^33][^34]

However several MKs, including Kadima MK [Meir Sheetrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Sheetrit "Meir Sheetrit"), suggested that Barghouti will likely be released as part of future peace negotiations, although they did not specify when. In January 2007, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister [Shimon Peres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres "Shimon Peres") declared that he would sign a presidential pardon for Marwan Barghouti if elected to the Israeli presidency.[^35] However, despite Peres winning the presidency, a pardon was not issued.

## Split from Fatah

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8_23.4.11_001.jpg/250px-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8_23.4.11_001.jpg)

A portrait of Marwan Barghouti at a demonstration at [Beit Ummar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_Ummar "Beit Ummar").

On 14 December 2005, Barghouti announced that he had formed a new political party, [al-Mustaqbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mustaqbal_\(electoral_list\) "Al-Mustaqbal (electoral list)") ("The Future"), mainly composed of members of Fatah's "Young Guard", who repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party. The list, which was presented to the Palestinian Authority's central elections committee on that day, included [Mohammed Dahlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Dahlan "Mohammed Dahlan"), [Kadoura Fares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadoura_Fares "Kadoura Fares"), [Samir Mashharawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Mashharawi "Samir Mashharawi") and [Jibril Rajoub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibril_Rajoub "Jibril Rajoub").[^medea-23]

The split followed Barghouti's earlier refusal of [Mahmoud Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas "Mahmoud Abbas")' offer to be second on the Fatah party's parliamentary list, behind Palestinian Prime Minister [Ahmed Qurei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Qurei "Ahmed Qurei"). Barghouti had actually topped the list,[^36] but this had not become apparent until after the new party had been registered.

Reactions to the news was split. Some suggested that the move was a positive step towards peace, as Barghouti's new party could help reform major problems in Palestinian government. Others raised concern that it could wind up splitting the Fatah vote, inadvertently helping Hamas. Barghouti's supporters argued that al-Mustaqbal would split the votes of both parties, both from disenchanted Fatah members as well as moderate Hamas voters who do not agree with Hamas' political goals, but rather its social work and hard position on corruption. Some observers also hypothesized that the formation of al-Mustaqbal was mostly a negotiating tactic to get members of the Young Guard into higher positions of power within Fatah and its electoral list.

Barghouti eventually was convinced that the idea of leading a new party, especially one that was created by splitting from Fatah, would be unrealistic while he was still in prison. Instead he stood as a Fatah candidate in the January 2006 [PLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council "Palestinian Legislative Council") elections, comfortably regaining his seat in the [Palestinian Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Parliament "Palestinian Parliament").

## Political activity in prison

In late 2004, Barghouti announced from his Israeli prison his intention to run in the Palestinian Authority [presidential election in January 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Palestinian_presidential_election "2005 Palestinian presidential election"), called for following the death of President [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat "Yasser Arafat") in November. On 26 November 2004, it appeared he would withdraw from the contest following pressure from the [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah") faction to support Abbas' candidacy. However, just before the deadline on 1 December, Barghouti's wife registered him as an independent candidate. On 12 December, facing pressure from Fatah to withdraw in favor of Abbas, he chose to abandon his candidacy for the benefit of Palestinian unity. On 11 May 2006, Palestinian leaders held in Israeli prisons released the [National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Prisoners%27_Document "Palestinian Prisoners' Document"). The document was a proposal initiated by Marwan Barghouti and leaders of [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas"), the [PFLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"), the [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad") and the [DFLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFLP "DFLP") that proposed a basis upon which a coalition government should be formed in the [Palestinian Legislative Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council "Palestinian Legislative Council"). This came as a result of the political stalemate in the [Palestinian territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories "Palestinian territories") that followed Hamas' election to the PLC in January 2006. Crucially, the document also called for negotiation with the state of Israel in order to achieve lasting peace. The document quickly gained popular currency and is now considered the bedrock upon which a national unity government should be achieved. According to Haaretz, Barghouti, although not officially represented in the negotiations of a Palestinian unity government in February 2007, played a major role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah and formulating the compromise reached on 8 February 2007.[^37] In 2009, he was elected to party leadership at the Fatah Conference in Bethlehem.[^haaretz1-8]

In April 2017 he organized a hunger strike of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails.[^38] He laid out the motivation<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="Statement needs to be more specific about the content to which it refers. (May 2017)">specify</span></a></i>]</sup> behind the strike in an op-ed in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")*.[^39] On 7 May, the [Israel Prison Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prison_Service "Israel Prison Service") released videos allegedly showing Barghouti hiding in the toilet stall of his cell while eating cookies and candy, then trying to flush the wrappers. The videos were recorded on 27 April and on 5 May, a period during which almost 1,000 of Barghouti's fellow prisoners were refusing all food.[^40][^41] Anonymous sources in the prison service confirmed the authenticity of the videos, saying that the food was made available to Barghouti to test his adherence to the hunger strike. Barghouti's attorney refused to respond to the videos, while his wife claimed that they had been "fabricated" to discredit him. Israeli media reported that this was not Barghouti's first time being caught secretly breaking a hunger strike, and that in 2004 he had been photographed hiding a plate after eating off it in his cell. [^42][^43][^44]

Barghouti remains popular among the Palestinian people. According to polling data in mid-2012, 60% of Palestinians would vote for him for president of the Palestinian Authority, beating both Abbas and Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh "Ismail Haniyeh").[^45]

In August 2023, Barghouti's wife Fadwa held meetings with senior officials and diplomats across the world, including Jordanian Foreign Minister [Ayman Safadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_Safadi "Ayman Safadi"), to advocate for her husband's release and position him as a successor to Abbas. According to [Al-Sharq al-Awsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Sharq_al-Awsat "Al-Sharq al-Awsat"), Barghouti would run in Palestinian presidential elections and maintained a polling lead over all other candidates.[^46] During the [Israel–Hamas war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war "Israel–Hamas war") in February 2024, Hamas called for Barghouti's release, but he has been placed in [solitary confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement "Solitary confinement").[^47]

Since [7 October 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel-Hamas_war "Israel-Hamas war") Barghouti has been held in solitary confinement, and according to his lawyer, denied medical treatment sustained during beatings. The [Public Committee Against Torture in Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Committee_Against_Torture_in_Israel "Public Committee Against Torture in Israel") has described the conditions under which he lives as 'torture'.[^48] In March 2024, Barghouti's family reported that he was [beaten by guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_abuse "Prisoner abuse") in prison.[^49][^50] The Prison Service denied any mistreatment, and stated that Barghouti had recently filed a petition that had been rejected by the courts.[^51] Israeli prison authorities were again accused of assaulting Barghouti in September 2024.[^52]
