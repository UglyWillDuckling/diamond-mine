**Woodrow Wilson Guthrie** (; July 14, 1912 – October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter and composer who was one of the most significant figures in [American folk music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music "American folk music"). His work focused on themes of [American socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Left "American Left") and [anti-fascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascism "Anti-fascism"). He inspired several generations both politically and musically with songs such as "[This Land Is Your Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land "This Land Is Your Land")".[^6][^7][^8]

Guthrie wrote hundreds of [country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music"), [folk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"), and [children's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_music "Children's music") songs, along with [ballads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad "Ballad") and improvised works. *[Dust Bowl Ballads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl_Ballads "Dust Bowl Ballads")*, Guthrie's album of songs about the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl") period, was included on *[Mojo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_\(magazine\) "Mojo (magazine)")* magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World,[^9] and many of his recorded songs are archived in the [Library of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress").[^10] Songwriters who have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence on their work include [Steve Earle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle "Steve Earle"), [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan"), [Lou Reed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed "Lou Reed"), [Phil Ochs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Ochs "Phil Ochs"), [Johnny Cash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash "Johnny Cash"), [Bruce Springsteen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen "Bruce Springsteen"), [Donovan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan "Donovan"), [Robert Hunter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_\(lyricist\) "Robert Hunter (lyricist)"), [Harry Chapin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Chapin "Harry Chapin"), [John Mellencamp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp "John Mellencamp"), [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger"), [Andy Irvine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Irvine_\(musician\) "Andy Irvine (musician)"), [Joe Strummer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer "Joe Strummer"), [Billy Bragg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bragg "Billy Bragg"), [Jerry Garcia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia"), [Bob Weir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weir "Bob Weir"), [Jeff Tweedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Tweedy "Jeff Tweedy"), [Tom Paxton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Paxton "Tom Paxton"), [Brian Fallon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fallon "Brian Fallon"), [Sean Bonnette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJJ_\(band\) "AJJ (band)"), and [Sixto Rodríguez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixto_Rodr%C3%ADguez "Sixto Rodríguez"). He frequently performed with the message "[This machine kills fascists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists "This machine kills fascists")" displayed on his guitar.

Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in [Okemah, Oklahoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okemah,_Oklahoma "Okemah, Oklahoma").[^ed_cray_2006_16-11] He married at 19, but with the advent of the [dust storms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm "Dust storm") that marked the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl") period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of [Okies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okie "Okie") who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station [KFVD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTNQ "KTNQ"), achieving some fame from playing [hillbilly music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_music "Hillbilly music"), made friends with [Will Geer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Geer "Will Geer") and [John Steinbeck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck "John Steinbeck"), and wrote a column for the [communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist "Communist") newspaper *[People's World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_World "People's World")* from May 1939 to January 1940.

Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with [United States communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUSA "CPUSA") groups, although he apparently did not belong to any.[^spivey-12] With the outbreak of World War II and the [Molotov–Ribbentrop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") non-aggression pact the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") had signed with Germany in 1939, the anti-Stalin owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings after he wrote a song praising the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the [Soviet invasion of Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland "Soviet invasion of Poland").[^kaufman2010-13] He left the station, ending up in New York, where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album *[Dust Bowl Ballads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl_Ballads "Dust Bowl Ballads")*, based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the "Dust Bowl Troubadour".[^14] In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, "[This Land Is Your Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land "This Land Is Your Land")". He said it was a response to what he felt was the overplaying of [Irving Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin "Irving Berlin")'s "[God Bless America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Bless_America "God Bless America")" on the radio.[^15]

Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son [Arlo Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlo_Guthrie "Arlo Guthrie") became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of [Huntington's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease "Huntington's disease"). His first two daughters also died of the disease.

Woody Guthrie's [Okfuskee County, Oklahoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okfuskee_County,_Oklahoma "Okfuskee County, Oklahoma"), childhood home as it appeared in 1979

Guthrie was born July 14, 1912, in [Okemah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okemah,_Oklahoma "Okemah, Oklahoma"), a small town in [Okfuskee County, Oklahoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okfuskee_County,_Oklahoma "Okfuskee County, Oklahoma"), the son of Nora Belle (née Sherman) and Charles Edward Guthrie.[^reitwiesner-16] His parents named him after [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson"), then Governor of New Jersey and the [Democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") candidate who was elected as President of the United States in [fall 1912](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election "1912 United States presidential election").[^17] Charles Guthrie was an industrious businessman, owning at one time up to 30 plots of land in Okfuskee County.[^ed_cray_2006_16-11] He was actively involved in Oklahoma politics and was a conservative Democratic candidate for office in the county. Charles Guthrie was reportedly involved in the 1911 [lynching of Laura and L. D. Nelson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Laura_and_L._D._Nelson "Lynching of Laura and L. D. Nelson").[^jackson136-18] (Woody Guthrie wrote three songs about the event in the 1960s. He said that his father, Charles, became a member of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan "Ku Klux Klan") during its revival beginning in 1915.[^jackson136-18][^19])

Three significant fires occurred during Guthrie's early life. In 1909, one fire caused the loss of his family's home in Okemah a month after it was completed.[^ed_cray_2006_16-11] When Guthrie was seven, his sister Clara died after setting her clothes on fire during an argument with her mother,[^20] and, later, in 1927, their father was severely burned in a fire at home.[^21] Guthrie's mother, Nora, was afflicted with [Huntington's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease "Huntington's disease"),[^celebrity_diagnosis-22] although the family did not know this at the time. What they could see was [dementia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia "Dementia") and muscular degeneration.[^23]

When Woody was 14, Nora was committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane. At the time his father Charles was living and working in [Pampa, Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampa,_Texas "Pampa, Texas"), to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support. The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends.

Guthrie had a natural affinity for music, learning old ballads and [traditional English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_folk_music "English folk music") and [Scottish songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_folk_music "Scottish folk music") from the parents of friends.[^clay28-24] Guthrie befriended an African-American [shoeshine boy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeshiner "Shoeshiner") named George, who played blues on his harmonica. After listening to George play, Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along with him.[^25][^26] He used to busk for money and food.[^clay28-24] Although Guthrie did not do well as a student and dropped out of high school in his senior year before graduation, his teachers described him as bright. He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics.[^clay44-27]

In 1929, Guthrie's father sent for Woody to join him in Texas,[^28] but little changed for the aspiring musician. Guthrie, then 18, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa; he spent most of his time learning songs by [busking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busking "Busking") on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa's city hall. He regularly played at dances with his father's half-brother Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player.[^clay44-27] His mother died in 1930 of complications of Huntington's disease while still in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane.

During the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl") period, Guthrie joined the thousands of [Okies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okies "Okies") and others who migrated to California to look for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by working-class people.

During the latter part of that decade in [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"), he achieved fame with radio partner [Maxine "Lefty Lou" Crissman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxine_%22Lefty_Lou%22_Crissman&action=edit&redlink=1 "Maxine \"Lefty Lou\" Crissman (page does not exist)") as a broadcast performer of commercial [hillbilly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly "Hillbilly") music and traditional folk music.[^29] Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family to join him from Texas. While appearing on the radio station [KFVD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTNQ "KTNQ"), owned by a populist-minded [New Deal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal "New Deal") Democrat, [Frank W. Burke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_W._Burke "Frank W. Burke"), Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that he eventually released on his album *[Dust Bowl Ballads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl_Ballads "Dust Bowl Ballads")*.

> This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright #154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin' it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don't give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that's all we wanted to do.

—Written by Guthrie in the late 1930s on a songbook distributed to listeners of his Los Angeles radio show *Woody and Lefty Lou*, who wanted the words to his recordings.[^curtis-30]

While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist [Thomas Mooney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mooney "Thomas Mooney"), wrongly convicted in a case that was a [cause célèbre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre "Cause célèbre") of the time.[^31] Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including Will Geer. (He introduced Guthrie to writer John Steinbeck.)[^32] Robbin remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the communist circles in Southern California.

Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that "the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the [Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA")",[^33] he was never a member of the party. He was noted as a [fellow traveler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_traveler "Fellow traveler")—an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while avoiding party discipline.[^34] Guthrie wrote a column for the communist newspaper, *[People's World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_World "People's World")*. The column, titled "Woody Sez", appeared a total of 174 times from May 1939 to January 1940. "Woody Sez" was not explicitly political, but it covered current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an [exaggerated hillbilly dialect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect "Eye dialect") and usually included a small comic.[^35] These columns were published posthumously as a collection after Guthrie's death.[^spivey-12]

With the outbreak of World War II and publicity about the [non-aggression pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff "spinning apologia" for the Soviet Union. They fired both Robbin and Guthrie.[^36] Without the daily radio show, Guthrie's employment chances declined, and he returned with his family to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer's invitation to New York City and headed east.[^:1-37]

### 1940s: Building a legacy

Arriving in New York, Guthrie, known as "the Oklahoma cowboy", was embraced by its folk music community.[^38][^39] For a time, he slept on a couch in [Will Geer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Geer "Will Geer")'s apartment. Guthrie made his first recordings—several hours of conversation and songs recorded by the folklorist [Alan Lomax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lomax "Alan Lomax") for the [Library of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress")—as well as an album, *[Dust Bowl Ballads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl_Ballads "Dust Bowl Ballads"),* for [Victor Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Records "Victor Records") in [Camden, New Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey "Camden, New Jersey").[^40]

Sample of Woody Guthrie's song, "This Land is Your Land"

In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, "[This Land Is Your Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land "This Land Is Your Land")", as a response to what he felt was an overplaying of [Irving Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin "Irving Berlin")'s "[God Bless America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Bless_America "God Bless America")" on the radio. Guthrie thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent.[^41] He adapted the melody from an old gospel song, "Oh My Loving Brother", which had been adapted by the country group the [Carter Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Family "Carter Family") for their song "Little Darling Pal Of Mine". Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment, "All you can write is what you see."[^ed_cray_2004_165-42] Although the song was written in 1940, it was four years before he recorded it for [Moses Asch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Asch "Moses Asch") in April 1944.[^43] Sheet music was produced and given to schools by [Howie Richmond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Richmond "Howie Richmond") sometime later.[^44]

In March 1940, Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by the John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Farm Workers, to raise money for migrant workers. There he met the folk singer [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger"), and the two men became good friends.[^ed_cray_2004_165-42] Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family. He recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie's mother, in which she asked for Seeger's help to persuade Guthrie to treat her daughter better.[^45]

From April 1940, Guthrie and Seeger lived together in the Greenwich Village loft of sculptor [Harold Ambellan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ambellan "Harold Ambellan") and his fiancée. Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS")'s radio program *Back Where I Come From* and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend [Huddie "Lead Belly" Ledbetter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_Belly "Lead Belly"). Ledbetter's Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the musician circle in New York at the time, and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends, as they had busked together at bars in Harlem.[^46]

In November 1941, Seeger introduced Guthrie to his friend the poet [Charles Olson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Olson "Charles Olson"), then a junior editor at the fledgling magazine *[Common Ground](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Ground_\(magazine\) "Common Ground (magazine)")*. The meeting led to Guthrie writing the article "Ear Players" in the Spring 1942 issue of the magazine. The article marked Guthrie's debut as a published writer in the mainstream media.[^cray2006-47]

In September 1940, Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program *Pipe Smoking Time*. Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940.[^cray197-48] He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary. He also brought her and the children to New York, where the family lived briefly in an apartment on [Central Park West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_West "Central Park West"). The reunion represented Woody's desire to be a better father and husband. He said, "I have to set \[*[sic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")*\] real hard to think of being a dad."[^cray197-48] Guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast, claiming he had begun to feel the show was too restrictive when he was told what to sing.[^cray200-49] Disgruntled with New York, Guthrie packed up Mary and his children in a new car and headed west to California.[^50]

Choreographer [Sophie Maslow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Maslow "Sophie Maslow") developed *[Folksay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Folksay&action=edit&redlink=1 "Folksay (page does not exist)")* as an elaborate mix of modern dance and ballet, which combined folk songs by Woody Guthrie with text from [Carl Sandburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sandburg "Carl Sandburg")'s 1936 book-length poem *[The People, Yes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People,_Yes "The People, Yes")*. The premiere took place in March 1942 at the Humphrey-Weidman Studio Theatre in New York City. Guthrie provided live music for the performance, which featured Maslow and her New Dance Group. Two-and-a-half years later, Maslow brought *[Folksay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Folksay&action=edit&redlink=1 "Folksay (page does not exist)")* to early television under the direction of Leo Hurwitz. The same group performed the ballet live in front of [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") TV cameras. The 30-minute broadcast aired on WCBW, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City (now [WCBS-TV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCBS-TV "WCBS-TV")), from 8:15–8:45 pm ET on November 24, 1944. Featured were Maslow and the New Dance Group, which included among others Jane Dudley, Pearl Primus, and William Bales. Woody Guthrie and fellow folk singer Tony Kraber played guitar, sang songs, and read text from *The People, Yes*. The program received positive reviews and was performed on television over WCBW a second time in early 1945.[^51]

Playing time 21:10.

In May 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved to [Portland, Oregon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon "Portland, Oregon"), in the [neighborhood of Lents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lents,_Portland,_Oregon "Lents, Portland, Oregon"), on the promise of a job. [Gunther von Fritsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunther_von_Fritsch "Gunther von Fritsch") was directing a documentary about the [Bonneville Power Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonneville_Power_Administration "Bonneville Power Administration")'s construction of the [Grand Coulee Dam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Coulee_Dam "Grand Coulee Dam") on the [Columbia River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River "Columbia River"), and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie's role. The [Department of the Interior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior "United States Department of the Interior") hired him for one month to write songs about the [Columbia River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River "Columbia River") and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack. Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he "couldn't believe it, it's a paradise",[^52] which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: "[Roll On, Columbia, Roll On](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_On,_Columbia,_Roll_On "Roll On, Columbia, Roll On")", "[Pastures of Plenty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastures_of_Plenty "Pastures of Plenty")", and "[Grand Coulee Dam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Coulee_Dam_\(song\) "Grand Coulee Dam (song)")".[^53] The surviving songs were released as *[Columbia River Songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Columbia_River_Collection_\(Woody_Guthrie_Album\) "The Columbia River Collection (Woody Guthrie Album)")*. The film "Columbia" was not completed until 1949 (see below). At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York. Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children.[^54] Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage. Divorce was difficult, since Mary was a [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943.[^55]

 Woody Guthrie, 1943

Following the conclusion of his work in the Northwest, Guthrie corresponded with [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger") about Seeger's newly formed folk-protest group, the [Almanac Singers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac_Singers "Almanac Singers"). Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group.[^56] The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called "[hootenannies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hootenanny "Hootenanny")", a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [Greenwich Village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village "Greenwich Village").

Initially, Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed "peace" songs while the Nazi–Soviet Pact was in effect. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger"), [Millard Lampell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Lampell "Millard Lampell") and [Lee Hays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hays "Lee Hays"). In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of "[Union Maid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Maid "Union Maid")", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.[^57]

In the Almanac House, Guthrie added authenticity to their work, since he was a "real" working class Oklahoman. "There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance," a friend of the group, [Irwin Silber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Silber "Irwin Silber"), would say.[^58] Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores. House member [Agnes "Sis" Cunningham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sis_Cunningham "Sis Cunningham"), another Okie, would later recall that Woody "loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual".[^59] Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger's post-Almanac Singers project *[People's Songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Songs "People's Songs")*, a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers, founded in 1945.[^ps1-60]

Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood.[^61] During this time, Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia (the professional name of Marjorie Greenblatt), a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the [Martha Graham Dance School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham_Center_of_Contemporary_Dance "Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance"), where she was assisting [Sophie Maslow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Maslow "Sophie Maslow") with her piece *Folksay*. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by [Carl Sandburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sandburg "Carl Sandburg"), *Folksay* included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's *Dust Bowl Ballads* for the dance.[^cray200-49] Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, [*Bound for Glory*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_for_Glory_\(book\) "Bound for Glory (book)"), was completed with editing assistance by Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943.[^62] It is told in the artist's down-home dialect. The *Library Journal* complained about the "too careful reproduction of illiterate speech". However, Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")*, remarked that "Someday people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like [Yellowstone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone "Yellowstone") and [Yosemite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite "Yosemite"), and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world."[^63]

This book was the inspiration for the movie *[Bound for Glory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_for_Glory_\(1976_film\) "Bound for Glory (1976 film)")*, starring [David Carradine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carradine "David Carradine"), which won the 1976 [Academy Award for Original Music Score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Original_Music_Score "Academy Award for Original Music Score") for Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Adaptation Score, and the [National Board of Review Award for Best Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review_Award_for_Best_Actor "National Board of Review Award for Best Actor"), among other accolades.

In 1944, Guthrie met [Moses "Moe" Asch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Asch "Moses Asch") of [Folkways Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkways_Records "Folkways Records"), for whom he first recorded "This Land Is Your Land". Over the next few years, he recorded "[Worried Man Blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worried_Man_Blues "Worried Man Blues")", along with [hundreds of other songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie_discography#1944_&_1945,_The_Asch_Recordings "Woody Guthrie discography"). These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records, which had joint distribution rights.[^64] The Folkways recordings are available (through the [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution "Smithsonian Institution") online shop); the most complete series of these sessions, culled from dates with Asch, is titled *[The Asch Recordings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asch_Recordings_\(Woody_Guthrie_Album\) "The Asch Recordings (Woody Guthrie Album)")*.

Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems in the United States was the best use of his talents.

In April 1942, *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* magazine reported that the [AFL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") (American Federation of Labor) and the [Congress of Industrial Organizations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations "Congress of Industrial Organizations") (CIO) had agreed to a joint radio production, called *Labor for Victory*. NBC agreed to run the weekly segment as a "public service". The AFL and CIO presidents [William Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Green_\(U.S._labor_leader\) "William Green (U.S. labor leader)") and [Philip Murray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Murray "Philip Murray") agreed to let their press chiefs, [Philip Pearl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Pearl&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philip Pearl (page does not exist)") and [Len De Caux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_De_Caux "Len De Caux"), narrate on alternate weeks. The show ran on NBC radio on Saturdays 10:15–10:30 pm, starting on April 25, 1942. *Time* wrote, "De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run, using labor news, name speakers and interviews with workmen. Labor partisanship, they promise, is out."[^65][^nbc-66] Writers for *Labor for Victory* included: Peter Lyon, a progressive journalist; [Millard Lampell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Lampell "Millard Lampell") (born Allan Sloane), later an American movie and television screenwriter; and Morton Wishengrad, who worked for the AFL.[^67][^68]

For entertainment on CIO episodes, De Caux asked singer and songwriter Woody Guthrie to contribute to the show. "Personally, I would like to see a phonograph record made of your 'Girl in the Red, White, and Blue.'"[^:1-37] The title appears in at least one collection of Guthrie records.[^69] Guthrie consented and performed solo two or three times on this program (among several other WWII radio shows, including *Answering You*, *Labor for Victory*, *Jazz in America*, and *We the People*).[^70][^71][^72] On August 29, 1942, he performed "The Farmer-Labor Train", with lyrics he had written to the tune of "[Wabash Cannonball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabash_Cannonball "Wabash Cannonball")". (In 1948, he reworked the "Wabash Cannonball" melody as "The Wallace-Taylor Train" for the [1948 Progressive National Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Progressive_National_Convention "1948 Progressive National Convention"), which nominated former U.S. Vice President [Henry A. Wallace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace "Henry A. Wallace") for president.)[^73][^74][^75] The [Almanac Singers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac_Singers "Almanac Singers") (of which Guthrie and Lampell were co-founders) appeared on *The Treasury Hour* and CBS Radio's *We the People*. The latter was later produced as a [television series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_\(U.S._TV_series\) "We the People (U.S. TV series)").[^76] (Also, [Marc Blitzstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Blitzstein "Marc Blitzstein")'s papers show that Guthrie made some contributions to four CIO episodes (dated June 20, June 27, August 1, August 15, 1948) of *Labor for Victory.*[^77]) While *Labor for Victory* was a milestone in theory as a national platform, in practice it proved less so. Only 35 of 104 NBC affiliates carried the show.[^nbc-66][^78][^79] Episodes included the announcement that the show represented "twelve million organized men and women, united in the high resolve to rid the world of Fascism in 1942". Speakers included [Donald E. Montgomery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_E._Montgomery "Donald E. Montgomery"), then "consumer's counselor" at the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Agriculture "U.S. Department of Agriculture").[^80][^81][^82]

Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a [USO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USO "USO") performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friends [Cisco Houston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Houston "Cisco Houston") and Jim Longhi persuaded the singer to join the [U.S. Merchant Marine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine "United States Merchant Marine") in June 1943.[^83] He made several voyages aboard merchant ships SS *William B. Travis*, SS *William Floyd*, and SS *Sea Porpoise*, while they traveled in [convoys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy "Convoy") during the [Battle of the Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic "Battle of the Atlantic"). He served as a mess man and dishwasher, and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages. His first ship, *William B. Travis*, hit a mine in the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"), killing one person aboard, but the ship sailed to [Bizerte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizerte "Bizerte"), Tunisia under her own power.[^84]

His last ship, *Sea Porpoise*, took troops from the United States to England and France for the [D-Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Day "D-Day") invasion. Guthrie was aboard when the ship was torpedoed off [Utah Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach "Utah Beach") by the [German submarine U-390](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-390 "German submarine U-390") on July 5, 1944, injuring 12 of the crew. Guthrie was unhurt and the ship stayed afloat; Sea Porpoise returned to England, where she was repaired at [Newcastle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne "Newcastle upon Tyne").[^85]<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s). (April 2023)">failed verification</span></a></i>]</sup> In July 1944, she returned to the United States.[^86]

Guthrie was an active supporter of the [National Maritime Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Maritime_Union "National Maritime Union"), one of many unions for wartime American merchant sailors. Guthrie wrote songs about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with them. Longhi later wrote about Guthrie's marine experiences in his book *Woody, Cisco and Me*.[^87] The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his [Merchant Marine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine "United States Merchant Marine") service, at one point describing how Guthrie referred to his guitar as a "Hoping Machine. But later during duty aboard the troop ship, Guthrie built an actual "Hoping Machine" made of cloth, whirligigs and discarded metal attached to a railing at the stern, aimed at lifting the soldiers' spirits. In 1945, the government decided that Guthrie's association with communism excluded him from further service in the Merchant Marine; he was drafted into the [U.S. Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army").[^88]

While he was on [furlough](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/furlough "wiktionary:furlough") from the Army, Guthrie married Marjorie.[^89] After his discharge, they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in [Coney Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island "Coney Island") and over time had four children: daughters Cathy and [Nora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_Guthrie "Nora Guthrie"); and sons [Arlo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlo_Guthrie "Arlo Guthrie") and Joady. Cathy died as a result of a fire at the age of four, and Guthrie suffered a serious depression from his grief.[^90] Arlo and Joady followed in their father's footsteps as singer-songwriters.

When his family was young, Guthrie wrote and recorded *[Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_to_Grow_on_for_Mother_and_Child "Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child")*, a collection of [children's music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_music "Children's music"), which includes the song "Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin')", written when Arlo was about nine years old. During 1947, he wrote *House of Earth*, an historical novel containing explicit sexual material, about a couple who build a house made of clay and earth to withstand the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl")'s brutal weather. He could not get it published.[^91] It was published posthumously in 2013, by [Harper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_\(publisher\) "Harper (publisher)"), under actor [Johnny Depp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp "Johnny Depp")'s publishing imprint, [Infinitum Nihil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitum_Nihil "Infinitum Nihil").

Guthrie was also a prolific sketcher and painter, his images ranging from simple, impressionistic images to free and characterful drawings, typically of the people in his songs.

In 1949, Guthrie's music was used in the documentary film *Columbia River*, which explored government dams and hydroelectric projects on the river.[^92] Guthrie had been commissioned by the US [Bonneville Power Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonneville_Power_Administration "Bonneville Power Administration") in 1941 to write songs for the project, but it had been postponed by World War II.[^93]

### Post-war: Mermaid Avenue

 This page from a collection of Guthrie's sheet music published in 1946 includes his Mermaid Avenue address and one of his [anti-fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascism "Anti-fascism") slogans

The years immediately after the war when he lived on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie's most productive as a writer. His extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by Marjorie and later his estate, mostly handled by his daughter Nora. Several of the manuscripts also contain writing by a young Arlo and the other Guthrie children.[^94]

During this time [Ramblin' Jack Elliott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramblin%27_Jack_Elliott "Ramblin' Jack Elliott") studied extensively under Guthrie, visiting his home and observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan") later, idolized Guthrie. He was inspired by the singer's idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of the decline caused by Guthrie's progressive [Huntington's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease "Huntington's disease"), Arlo Guthrie and Bob Dylan both later said that they had learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about this, Elliott said, "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from [Lead Belly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_Belly "Lead Belly")."[^95]

## Later life and death

### Deteriorating health due to Huntington's

By the late 1940s, Guthrie's health was declining, and his behavior was becoming extremely erratic. He received various diagnoses (including [alcoholism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism "Alcoholism") and [schizophrenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia "Schizophrenia")). In 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from [Huntington's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease "Huntington's disease"),[^celebrity_diagnosis-22] a genetic disorder inherited from his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children because of his behavior, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her. They eventually divorced.[^96]

Upon his return to California, Guthrie lived at the [Theatricum Botanicum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatricum_Botanicum "Theatricum Botanicum"), a [summer-stock type theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_stock_theatre "Summer stock theatre") founded and owned by [Will Geer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Geer "Will Geer"). Together with singers and actors who had been blacklisted by [HUAC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUAC "HUAC"), he waited out the [anti-communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communist "Anti-communist") political climate.

As his health worsened, he met and married his third wife, Anneke van Kirk. They had a child, Lorina Lynn. The couple moved to [Fruit Cove, Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_Cove,_Florida "Fruit Cove, Florida"), where they briefly lived. They lived in a bus on land called [Beluthahatchee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluthahatchee "Beluthahatchee"), owned by his friend [Stetson Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stetson_Kennedy "Stetson Kennedy"). Guthrie's arm was hurt in an accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York,[^97] living in the Beach Haven apartment complex owned and operated by [Fred Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump "Fred Trump") in [Gravesend, Brooklyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravesend,_Brooklyn "Gravesend, Brooklyn"); Guthrie composed there the song "[Old Man Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_Trump "Old Man Trump")". Shortly after, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Anneke left New York after arranging for friends to adopt Lorina Lynn. Lorina had no further contact with her birth parents. She died in a car accident in California in 1973 at the age of 19.[^ed_cray_2006_16-11] After the divorce, Guthrie's second wife, Marjorie, re-entered his life and cared for him until his death.

Increasingly unable to control his muscles, Guthrie was hospitalized at [Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greystone_Park_Psychiatric_Hospital "Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital") in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961; at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in [East Flatbush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Flatbush,_Brooklyn "East Flatbush, Brooklyn") until 1966;[^98] and finally at [Creedmoor Psychiatric Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedmoor_Psychiatric_Center "Creedmoor Psychiatric Center") in [Queens Village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Village,_Queens "Queens Village, Queens"), New York, until his death in 1967.[^99] Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and the children played on the hospital grounds. Eventually, a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to [Howard Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Beach,_Queens "Howard Beach, Queens"), New York, where Marjorie and the children then lived.

During the final few years of his life, Guthrie had become isolated except for family. By 1965, he was unable to speak, often moving his arms or rolling his eyes to communicate.[^100] The progression of Huntington's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states, causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke's.[^101] Huntington's symptoms include uncharacteristic aggression, emotional volatility, and social disinhibition.[^102]

Guthrie's death increased awareness of the disease. Marjorie helped found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the [Huntington's Disease Society of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_Disease_Society_of_America "Huntington's Disease Society of America").[^103] None of Guthrie's three surviving children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's.

His son Bill with his first wife Mary Guthrie died in an auto-train accident in [Pomona, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona,_California "Pomona, California"), at the age of 23.[^104] His and Mary's two daughters, Gwendolyn and Sue, both suffered from Huntington's disease. They each died at age 41.[^105]

### Folk revival and death

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new generation of young people were inspired by folk singers such as Guthrie. The [American Folk Revival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music_revival "American folk music revival") was beginning to take place, focused on the issues of the day, such as the [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") and [Free Speech Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Movement "Free Speech Movement"). Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places such as [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts "Cambridge, Massachusetts"), and the [Greenwich Village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village "Greenwich Village") neighborhood of New York City. One of Guthrie's visitors at Greystone Park was the 19-year-old [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan"),[^106] who idolized Guthrie. Dylan wrote of Guthrie's repertoire: "The songs themselves were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them."[^107] After learning of Guthrie's whereabouts, Dylan regularly visited him.[^108]

Woody Guthrie died at Creedmore State Hospital of complications of [Huntington's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease "Huntington's disease") on October 3, 1967.[^109] According to a Guthrie family legend, he was listening to his son Arlo's "[Alice's Restaurant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Restaurant "Alice's Restaurant")", a recording of which Arlo had delivered to Woody's bedside, shortly before he died.[^npr2005-110] His remains were cremated and scattered at sea.[^111] By the time of Guthrie's death, his work had been discovered by a new audience, introduced to them through Dylan, Pete Seeger, [Ramblin' Jack Elliott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramblin%27_Jack_Elliott "Ramblin' Jack Elliott"), his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival, including his son Arlo Guthrie.

For a December 3, 1944 radio show, Guthrie wrote a script explaining why he sang the kinds of songs he did, reading it on air:

> I hate a song that makes you think that you are not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim too ugly or too this or too that. Songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard traveling. I am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood. I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it's hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built, I am out to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work.[^112]

At age 20, Guthrie met and married his first wife, Oklahoma-born Mary Jennings (1917–2014), in Texas in 1931. They had three children together: Gwendolyn, Sue, and Bill.[^113][^114] Bill died at the age of 23 as the result of an automobile accident. The daughters both died of Huntington's disease at the age of 41, in the 1970s. Evidently the disease had been passed on from their father, although Guthrie himself was diagnosed with the condition later in life, in 1952, when he was 43 years old. Guthrie and Mary divorced in 1940.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="The article tells they were still together in 1941, and that Mary agreed to divorce only in 1943 (April 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Mary Esther Jennings Guthrie Bailey Boyle remarried, had another child, and died at the age of 97 in California.

Guthrie married twice more, to [Marjorie Greenblatt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Guthrie "Marjorie Guthrie") (1945–1953), and Anneke van Kirk (1953–1956), having a total of eight children.

### Political views and relation to the Communist Party

Socialism had an important impact on the work of Woody Guthrie. In the introduction to Will Kaufman’s book *Woody Guthrie an American Radical* Kaufman states that "Woody Guthrie spent his productive life on the warpath-against poverty, political oppression, censorship, capitalism, fascism, racism, and, ultimately, war itself."[^115] Guthrie would time and time again back these beliefs up in his lyrics, specifically against capitalism at the height of the depression in the United States.

On the matter of the Communist party specifically, Guthrie never publicly declared himself a communist, though he was closely associated with the Party. Kaufman says,

> As he once claimed: "If you call me a Communist, I am very proud because it takes a wise and hard-working person to be a Communist" (qtd. in Klein 303). Klein also says that Guthrie applied to join the Communist Party, but his application was turned down. In later years, he'd say, "I'm not a Communist, but I've been in the red all my life." He took great delight in proclaiming his hopes for a communist victory in the Korean War and more than once expressed his admiration for Stalin. Unlike his musical protégé, Pete Seeger, Guthrie never offered any regret for his Stalinism.[^kaufman2010-13]

The matter of Guthrie's membership, however, remains controversial. Scholar [Ronald Radosh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Radosh "Ronald Radosh") has written:

> \[H\]is friends Gordon Friesen and Sis Cunningham, the founders in the 1960s of Broadside, and former members of the Almanac Singers, told me in a 1970s interview that Woody was a member of the same CP club as they were, and was regularly given a stack of The Daily Worker which he had to sell on the streets each day.[^radosh-116]

Similarly, writer and historian [Aaron J. Leonard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_J._Leonard "Aaron J. Leonard"), in an article detailing Guthrie's Party membership for the [History News Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_News_Network "History News Network"), quoted [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger"):

> On the other hand, Sis Cunningham, who was a much more disciplined person than either me or Woody, was in a Greenwich Village Branch of the Party. She got Woody in. She probably said, I'll see Woody acts responsibly.' And so Woody was briefly in the Communist Party.[^117]

Leonard, in his book *[The Folk Singers and the Bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Folk_Singers_and_the_Bureau "The Folk Singers and the Bureau")* also documents how the FBI treated Guthrie as if he were a member, adding him to various iterations of their [Security Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Index "Security Index") – and keeping him on it till well into the early 1960s.[^118]

After the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact"), Guthrie took an anti-war U-turn and wrote one song describing the Soviet invasion of Poland as a favor to Polish farmers, and another attacking President Roosevelt's loans to Finland to help it defend against the Soviet Union's invasion in the 1939 Winter War. His attitude switched again in 1941 after the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union.[^kaufman2010-13]
