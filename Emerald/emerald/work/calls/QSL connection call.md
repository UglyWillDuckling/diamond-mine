## discussion
- [?] [[Paulo]] - go through the 2 options?
	- [?] [[Marc Jonot]] - Athena first option #diagram
		- [[Ievgen Demenikov]] - queries would be going to Athena: sql
		- & good thing is quries are going to [[Amazon Athena]]
		- ðŸ“” more flexibility with Athena since we can make any type of a [[query]]
	- [?] [[Paulo]] could something go wrong?
		- [i] [[Marc Jonot]] you can put requirements on the data in [[Amazon Athena]]
			- there are alerting channels on [[Slack]] #notify
		- [i] [[Ievgen Demenikov]] you can see metrics in [[data dog]]
			- you need to come up with metrics that you wish to see
				- examples: number of records, freshness of data
- [?] [[Paulo]] - can you handle the procedure? We will give you something from dev and prod
		on our side we will <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">shift</mark> to the **Athena query**
	- [?] do you have any examples?
		- @ [[Marc Jonot]] I have a bit of [[php]] knowledge , will send a link to an example in php
