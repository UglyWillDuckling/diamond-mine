***Inferno*** is a 2013 [mystery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction "Mystery fiction") [thriller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_\(genre\) "Thriller (genre)") novel by American author [Dan Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown "Dan Brown") and the fourth book in his [*Robert Langdon* series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Langdon_\(book_series\) "Robert Langdon (book series)"), following *[Angels & Demons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Demons "Angels & Demons")*, *[The Da Vinci Code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code "The Da Vinci Code")* and *[The Lost Symbol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Symbol "The Lost Symbol")*. The book was published on May 14, 2013, ten years after publication of *[The Da Vinci Code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code "The Da Vinci Code")* (2003), by [Doubleday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleday_\(publisher\) "Doubleday (publisher)").[^1] It was number one on the *New York Times* Best Seller list for hardcover fiction and Combined Print & E-book fiction for the first eleven weeks of its release, and also remained on the list of E-book fiction for the first seventeen weeks of its release. A [film adaptation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_\(2016_film\) "Inferno (2016 film)") was released in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") on October 28, 2016.

[Harvard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard "Harvard") symbolism professor [[Robert Langdon]] wakes up in a hospital in [Florence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), Italy, with a head wound and [no memory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia "Amnesia") of the last few days. [[Dr. Sienna Brooks]], one of the doctors tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia and hearing a woman's voice repeatedly saying "seek and find". When Vayentha, an assassin, shows up in the hospital and kills one of the doctors while attempting to kill Langdon, Brooks helps Langdon escape, and they flee to her apartment. Brooks plays a tape recording on which Langdon repeats what sounds like "very sorry", which he later discovers he mumbled "Vasari".

Langdon finds a cylinder with a [biohazard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biohazard "Biohazard") sign in his jacket and decides to call the U.S. [consulate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulate "Consulate"). He learns that they are searching for him but, prompted by Brooks, claims to be across the street from her apartment, to avoid getting her more involved. Soon, Langdon sees Vayentha pull up to the location he gave the consulate. He deduces that the U.S. government wants to kill him. Langdon opens the container and finds a small medieval bone cylinder fitted with a hi-tech projector (Faraday Pointer) that displays a modified version of [Botticelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botticelli "Botticelli") 's *[Map of Hell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_of_Hell "Map of Hell")*, which is based on Dante's *[Inferno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_\(Dante\) "Inferno (Dante)")*. A trail of clues leads them toward the Old City.

The [Palazzo Vecchio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Vecchio "Palazzo Vecchio") in Florence

Langdon goes there with Brooks but they see that a team of soldiers, and the Florentine [Carabinieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabinieri "Carabinieri") are searching for them. They flee, and Langdon examines the "Map of Hell" again, noticing several changes to the layers. Langdon discovers an anagram, *Catro Vacer*, which means to "seek and find" as heard by Langdon in his visions. They manage to evade the soldiers and get into the [Palazzo Vecchio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Vecchio "Palazzo Vecchio") using the [Vasari Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasari_Corridor "Vasari Corridor"). They discover the phrase in the painting *[The Battle of Marciano](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giorgio_Vasari_-_The_battle_of_Marciano_in_Val_di_Chiana_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg "c:File:Giorgio Vasari - The battle of Marciano in Val di Chiana - Google Art Project.jpg")* by [Vasari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasari "Vasari"), located in the Hall of the Five Hundred.

At the Palazzo, Langdon meets a guide of the museum, Marta Alvarez, who recognizes him, having met him and Ignazio Busoni, the director of [Il Duomo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral "Florence Cathedral"), the previous night, when she showed them Dante's [death mask](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_mask "Death mask"). Langdon asks to see the mask again in order to retrace his steps but they find the mask gone, and security footage shows Langdon and Busoni stealing the mask. Fleeing, Langdon and Sienna listen to a message left by Busoni, referring to "Paradise 25".

*Gates of Paradise* at [Florence Baptistry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Baptistry "Florence Baptistry")

Langdon and Brooks escape the guards but the soldiers arrive, and chase them across the attic. Vayentha also arrives, and while she attempts to shoot Langdon, Brooks pushes her to her death. Langdon connects the phrase "Paradise 25" to the [Florence Baptistry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Baptistry "Florence Baptistry"), where they find the Dante mask containing a hidden [riddle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddle "Riddle") from its current owner, a billionaire geneticist named Bertrand Zobrist. Brooks explains that Zobrist was a geneticist who advocated the halting of humanity's growth, and that he was rumored to be working on an engineered disease to do so.

Ferris, an agent keeping track of Langdon, follows them in and helps them escape the soldiers. They follow the riddle solution to [Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"). Brooks punches Ferris in his damaged ribs, with Brooks claiming he is suffering from massive internal bleeding, causing Langdon to suspect Ferris has been infected with Zobrist's plague. Langdon is captured by a group of soldiers while Brooks escapes.

Langdon is taken to Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey, the director-general of the WHO. She explains that Zobrist, who committed suicide the week before, had supposedly developed a new biological plague that will cause infertility in a third of the worlds' population in order to solve the problem of the world's impending [overpopulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation "Human overpopulation"), citing the [Doomsday Argument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Argument "Doomsday Argument"). Sinskey raided Zobrist's [safe deposit box](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_deposit_box "Safe deposit box"), found the cylinder, and flew Langdon to Florence to follow the clues; however, he stopped communicating with Sinskey after meeting with Alvarez and Ignazio, and the WHO feared he betrayed them and was working with Zobrist. The soldiers were the WHO's emergency response team, and were not meant to kill him.

Zobrist had paid a shadowy consulting group "The Consortium" to protect the cylinder until a certain date. He also left a video filled with disturbing Dante imagery, and then showed a picture of the plague container kept in a hidden underwater location. It is a slowly dissolving bag. The video claims that the world will be changed the following morning. When Sinskey retrieved it, the Consortium abducted Langdon and staged every event up to this point, to motivate him to solve it.

Tomb of [Enrico Dandolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Dandolo "Enrico Dandolo"), at the [Hagia Sophia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia "Hagia Sophia")

Brooks goes rogue and The Consortium realizes she was a secret supporter and lover of Zobrist. She learned where the plague was being kept after Langdon extracted the text from DorÃ¨'s illustration *Dandolo Preaching the Crusade* at St. Mark's Basilica and acquires a private jet to get to the Plague. Langdon, the WHO, and The Consortium team up to stop her. After watching Zobrist's video, they conclude that the bag containing the plague will be fully dissolved by the date the video specifies and that Zobrist's clues point to its location: the [Hagia Sophia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia "Hagia Sophia") in [Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul"). They find the plague is in the [Cistern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_Cistern "Basilica Cistern") but discover Brooks already there. The bag that held the plague had already been broken, spreading to the world via visiting tourists. Brooks runs out of the Cistern, causing panicked tourists to stampede, while Langdon gives chase.

Inside [Basilica Cistern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_Cistern "Basilica Cistern"), with water below and tourists above

Despite almost escaping, Brooks returns and reveals that the bag had already dissolved one week earlier. The date specified in Zobrist's video was the mathematical calculation of when the entire world would be infected, which has already happened. The plague that Zobrist created is revealed to be a [vector virus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector "Viral vector") that randomly activates to employ DNA modification to cause [sterility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility "Infertility") in one third of humans. Brooks reveals that she was trying to stop the virus herself, distrusting the WHO, fearing the virus would be weaponized if they found it. The leader of The Consortium tries to escape WHO custody but is caught later. Brooks receives amnesty in exchange for working with the WHO to address the crisis, since she has extensive knowledge of Zobrist's research and work.

Brown released the book's title on his website on January 15, 2013,[^2] after prompting readers to help reveal a digital [mosaic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic "Mosaic") using social media posts,[^3] and revealed the cover in late February 2013.[^4] The cover depicts the famous [Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_di_Santa_Maria_del_Fiore "Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore") located in [Florence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), Italy. He also published the first chapter of *Inferno* along with a free ebook of *The Da Vinci Code* on March 17. The ebook was distributed for free to readers worldwide through online e-book stores like Amazon, Google Play and Barnes & Noble until March 24, 2013. Transworld publishers, the official UK publisher of Dan Brown books, have also released the official book trailer through YouTube and others.

*Inferno* has been translated into French, Russian, Turkish, Greek, German, Dutch, Spanish, Catalan, Italian, Czech, Portuguese, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish for simultaneous release. The publishers hired a team of 11 translators who worked on the project at the headquarters of [Mondadori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondadori "Mondadori") in Milan between February and April 2013. They were reportedly sequestered in a basement, and worked intensively under strict security and secrecy, which inspired the 2019 film by [RÃ©gis Roinsard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R%C3%A9gis_Roinsard&action=edit&redlink=1 "RÃ©gis Roinsard (page does not exist)").[^5] It has been also translated into Persian by Afraz Publication, 3 months after first publishing.[^6] The book was translated into Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian and Azerbaijani and released simultaneously in January 2014.

[Sony Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures "Sony Pictures") announced a [film adaptation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation "Film adaptation") would be released on October 14, 2016,[^7] with [Ron Howard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard "Ron Howard") as director, [David Koepp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koepp "David Koepp") adapting the screenplay and [Tom Hanks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks "Tom Hanks") reprising his role as Robert Langdon.[^8] On December 2, 2014, [Felicity Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicity_Jones "Felicity Jones") was set to star in the film as Sienna Brooks.[^9] [Indian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people "Indian people") actor [Irrfan Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrfan_Khan "Irrfan Khan") was cast as The Provost.[^10] Danish actress [Sidse Babett Knudsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidse_Babett_Knudsen "Sidse Babett Knudsen") was added to the cast as Elizabeth Sinskey.[^11] Filming began on April 27, 2015, in [Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"), [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), and wrapped up on July 21, 2015.[^12] The first half of film is mostly faithful to the novel, deviating significantly toward the end, specifically that Langdon and his team arrive at the baths in time to prevent the release of the virus rather than arriving a week after it was deployed.

*Inferno* received mixed reviews from critics. *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* praised the book as being "jampacked with tricks" and said that Langdon is on "one of those book-length scavenger hunts that Mr. Brown creates so energetically." [^13] The New York *[Daily News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_News_\(New_York\) "Daily News (New York)")* reviewed the book favorably, calling it a book of "harrowing fun threaded with coded messages, art history, science, and imminent doom." [^14] *[The Boston Globe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe "The Boston Globe") '* s Chuck Leddy compared the book favorably to Brown's previous works, and deemed it "the kind of satisfying escapist read that summers were made for." [^15]

Other reviews were more negative. James Kidd of *[The Independent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent "The Independent")* panned Brown's awkward prose but expressed approval of the book's plot, writing: "Brown's fusion of gothic hyperbole with a pedant's tour-guide deliberately restrains the imagination through its awkward awfulness." [^16] Samra Amir of *[The Express Tribune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Express_Tribune "The Express Tribune")* was critical of the novel's predictability and [malapropism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism "Malapropism"), but noted that "Brown's art reigns over boredom. He manages to keep the reader glued." [^17] Writing for *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")*, Peter Conrad dismissed the book's content as "conspiratorial farrago" and further elaborated: " *Inferno* is also dreadful, abounding in malapropisms and [solecisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solecism "Solecism"), leaden restatements of the obvious and naive disinformation about the reality outside the bat-thronged belfry that is Brown's head." [^18]

The novel received backlash from [Filipinos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos "Filipinos") [^19] after a character named Sienna Brooks, narrating through flashbacks, recounts being sexually assaulted in a [Manila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila "Manila") slum after volunteering in a humanitarian mission in the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines"). In this flashback, the character described the capital as "the gates of hell".[^20] Several authorities expressed their disappointment over the grim and graphic representation of the city, in particular then [Metropolitan Manila Development Authority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Manila_Development_Authority "Metropolitan Manila Development Authority") chairman [Francis Tolentino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Tolentino "Francis Tolentino") through a letter of protest sent to the author.[^21]

*Inferno* initially sold 369,000 copies at outlets that report to [Nielsen BookScan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_BookScan "Nielsen BookScan"). It debuted as the #1 bestselling book in the US and was also atop the UK's book charts in its first week in shops, selling 228,961 copies. The book remained #1 on Nielsen BookScan for the week ending May 26, selling 211,000 copies and bringing its two-week total to 580,000. Despite slipping 42% in its second week, *Inferno* far outpaced the #2 book, [Khaled Hosseini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Hosseini "Khaled Hosseini") 's *[And the Mountains Echoed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_the_Mountains_Echoed "And the Mountains Echoed")*, which posted a debut of 91,000 copies. *Inferno* sold more than 6 million copies worldwide to date.
