## notes ðŸ—’

- ! [[Yoan Haouzi]] has access to [[Diabolocom]] production
- we will soon need to replace Diabolocom
- VPN access is on the [[service portal]]
- next ticket is the PHP upgrade

## conversation ðŸ—¨

- [ ] suggest that we have regular meeting for a week or so which would allow more time for the new people to form a concept of the project and formulate questions. On the other side, the onboarder can cover more topics in depth and explain things in several ways
	- should reduce knowledge omitions
	- reduces the pressure to know everthing and to cover everything
	- allows for more flexibility and to change course or priorities as more topics are covered
	-  allows for more communication between people
	- should enable easier generation of potential documenation for the project
