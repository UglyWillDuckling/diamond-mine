## who
- Marie-Lucile Jumel
- Thomas Sirgant
- [[Paulo]]

## what


---
## important âš 
- ! there is no way to ensure that the listing is correct
- ! no more bandwith on the other side
- we need an MVP
- & scope **creep**

## question
- [?] How will the [[Coach]]es be notified?
	- @ there is no `automation` at this point
- [?] How will the listing be shown? A person sees the one link to the listing?
	- [?] What happens if the listing is not the right one?
		- @ [[Paulo]] For now , we don't have support to do anything
- [?] any discussion  with Sona on the timeline and the future
	- for now no
- [?] Marie: could we get a screen of the new link?
	- yes

## decisions ðŸŒ³
- $ **no more** scope
	- we go with what we have
- `notifications` are not included

## notes ðŸ—’
- @ code `freeze` should be coming soon
- the [[Coach]] needs to make allot of calls even before the [[mandate]] is signed
	- In the current implementation, a person needs to confirm the listing([[classified]])
		- in the future, we this could be fully automated
- rebuilding the `URL`
	- ~ we **cannot ensure** that this will be correct
		- sometimes it will not work
		- this should be **rare**, a small percentage
