The base model of Pilet 7 is almost ready. We’re currently exploring the inclusion of an additional feature for Pilet 7: Detachable Modules. While it’s not finalized yet, it’s an exciting addition we’re working hard to make a reality. We’ll keep you updated as development progresses. ![](https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/047/211/834/334751f9b9b7c6a23d39a65ffc84a61b_original.png?fit=scale-down&origin=ugc&q=92&width=1000&sig=P2T9UilW3iRe3w%2B%2BRgJAuhh%2FU7qL8WNYnvlGDX8qlZ8%3D)The modular design enables the addition of various components, such as a keyboard, gamepad, or deck. Our aim is to make the modular mechanism fully 3D printable, allowing users to create and customize their own modules to seamlessly attach to the Pilet 7.

With proper funding, we aim to finalize the modular mechanism of Pilet 7, bringing this exciting feature to life.![](https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/047/218/539/42697c5cd8455047e72843de8547860a_original.jpg?fit=scale-down&origin=ugc&q=92&width=1440&sig=LzT259azKlCVrM%2BsVimcp4mt6fOm2JLDRBxrIjF7L8o%3D)

### Battery Management Module

Powering the Raspberry Pi 5 with batteries isn’t always straightforward, especially with heavy workloads or when using power-hungry peripherals. After six months of careful design, we’ve developed a reliable battery module featuring Texas Instruments’ TPS61088. This module ensures stable power delivery, meeting and exceeding the Raspberry Pi’s 5A requirement to keep your setup running smoothly without any undervoltage issues, regardless of the load.

![](https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/047/247/394/db8d9ffdb3c3d69bfb0462dbf6c119f3_original.png?fit=scale-down&origin=ugc&q=100&v=1731426498&width=680&sig=BRJhT5rclTGZqjC64e3YMzv0%2FzUBndMHmr8e7%2FF2ccM%3D)

The battery module features efficient charging with built-in reverse polarity and overcurrent protection for enhanced reliability. We’ve finalized the schematics and PCB design for the battery module. Huge thanks to PCBWay for generously sponsoring our prototyping, allowing us to create and test the module. It has undergone extensive testing to ensure reliable performance.![](https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/047/701/526/9565a64870e8db8edb312bf24016163f_original.jpeg?fit=scale-down&origin=ugc&q=92&v=1735708970&width=1500&sig=Ilo7g2LG0Gv7xG6EQMXmeEuVMKockLuzOOkamevrkJU%3D)

Typically, the Raspberry Pi 5 requires a power supply that can reliably deliver 5V and 5A. With Pilet, however, you're not limited to using a Raspberry Pi-specific power supply. You can charge your Pilet from any standard 5V USB source—whether it's your laptop, PC, car, airplane, or power bank—even if those sources can't provide 5A. The battery module automatically boosts current for more demanding applications.

#### Battery Options

The base kit doesn’t include batteries, but you can easily add them as an add-on when backing the project. Alternatively, you’re welcome to source your own. If you choose the DIY route, we’ll provide a detailed guide to help you source and crimp the batteries step-by-step.

The batteries in our battery add-on features dual rechargable 8000mAh lithium polymer batteries that provide 7-hours on-screen battery life. With power-saver mode enabled in Pilet OS, the battery life can stretch beyond seven hours. Pilet can also be used without batteries by connecting it directly to a USB power supply.

### Open-Source Design

We’re dedicated to making all our hardware and software fully open source upon release. The hardware will be licensed under CERN-OHL-S, while the software will be released under GPL. Unlike many projects that only share simplified schematics, we’re taking it further by providing complete schematics alongside the original KiCad PCB design files. Additionally, CAD and STEP files for all components will also be made available.

#### What Will Be Open Source

The following components will be available under CERN-OHL-S license:

#### Timeline for Open Sourcing

The source code will be released when the first units of Pilet are shipped. It will initially be available to testers and then later to the general public.

Once the design and code are published on our [GitHub](https://github.com/soulscircuit/pilet), we invite the community to contribute through pull requests, issue reports, and creative ideas. We encourage you to design and share custom modules for Pilet by submitting them as pull requests.
