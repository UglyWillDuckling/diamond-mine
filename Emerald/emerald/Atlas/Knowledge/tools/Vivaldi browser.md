## notes
### ðŸŒž

In general, Vivaldi offers an incredible amount of flexibility unmatched by any other browsers. From moving tabs to any side to customizing the smallest UI details, [[Vivaldi browser|Vivaldi]] has it all has it all.
### what I like (so far)

- [[#shortcuts]]
- [[#ability to edit almost anything]]
- [[#built on chromium]]
- the pause feature

### shortcuts

You can define shortcuts for just about any action
### ability to edit almost anything 

You can edit and customize everything. From position of the tabs,shortcuts, start page, sessions, themes, dark/light modes, address bars, panels... you name it.

### built on [[chromium]]

Since Vivaldi is built on [[chromium]] it supports **all** extensions for [[Chrome browser]], which means you don't have to worry about using your old(or new) extensions, it all works as before.
