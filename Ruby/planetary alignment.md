🌌 Viewers around the world will soon be able to witness the Grand Planetary Alignment of 2025! Here are all the details 👇🏻

Until now, six of the seven planets in the sky could be seen simultaneously. However, starting February 20, Mercury will join the spectacle in the west after sunset.

As twilight fades to darkness, look toward the southwestern horizon. There, you’ll spot Venus and Saturn appearing close together. Venus, the brighter of the two, will be unmissable.

Higher in the sky, you’ll find Jupiter, the second brightest speck of light in the night sky after Venus. Jupiter recently passed its opposition, making this one of the best times of the year to observe the gas giant with the naked eye.

Near the eastern horizon, Mars will shine brightly with its signature red hue, making it a captivating sight in the night sky. January and February are the best months of the year to observe the Red Planet, as it is around the closest to Earth after its opposition on January 15.

Uranus will be positioned near Jupiter, and Neptune will be close to Venus and Saturn. You will need optical aid to see both these ice giants, as their magnitude is beyond the naked eye limit.

Happy Sky-gazing 💜
