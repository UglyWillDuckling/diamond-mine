## discussion

### User **Management** screen [LUNA-384](https://avivgroup.atlassian.net/browse/LUNA-384)
> only covers the screen itself

- **no gemini** component
	- only for some parts

my estimate: 5
### User deletion [LUNA-379](https://avivgroup.atlassian.net/browse/LUNA-379)
%% [[Corentin]]: I removed the button  %%

==Ability== to delete the user **completely**

- the user can also be deactivated
- ? how often does this happen
	- @ not too often **but** we need to support this

> [!check] needs to be refined
> This will require further **discussion** and design
