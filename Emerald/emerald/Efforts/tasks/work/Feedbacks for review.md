## [[Natasa Bozic]]

**How would you describe Nataša’s overall impact on the team and projects?**

More than positive, I feel like without her we would be wondering about aimlessly not knowing what to do and where to look.
I feel like we wouldn't have a tenth of the project and business knowledge that we have.

**Are there any skills or behaviors Nataša could develop to be even more effective in her role?**
What skills? what behaviors?

## [[Paulo Baskovic]]

**How well does Paulo help resolve challenges and remove obstacles to your work?**

> Probably his greatest strength of all of the things listed.

The obstacles are removed quickly and with no fuss. Most of the time I feel like he's already expecting them to happen which is why he's so prepared.

Sometimes he even resolves things before they happen.

**How effectively does Paulo support your professional growth and career development?**

Extremely well, goes above and beyond his responsibilities.

Gives very practical and knowledegable advice.

Goes to great lengths to ensure that we have a solid plan for the future and that I stick to it.
