We are familiar with mathematical identities of algebra such as multiply anything by zero and we get zero or add zero to anything and we get the original value. In Boolean algebra, we have those identities and more.  
  
Takeaways: At the completion of this lesson, each student should be able to:  
• list the basic Boolean identities of the AND, OR, and XOR operations and  
• use a truth table to prove those basic identities.
