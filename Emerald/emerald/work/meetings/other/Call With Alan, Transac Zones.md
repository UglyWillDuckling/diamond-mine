# agenda

We need to discuss the Transac plan in general. We also need to cover [[Investigate Usage of product_coverage table on Backyard]] and beyond. This is especially important as it could impact many parts of the [[backyard]] application and even other apps and systems.

The goal is first to obtain any relevant information that is still missing, determine any points of missunderstanding that exist and perhaps discover new ones. 
Beyond that, we need to make a clear and realistic goal as to when this feature would be deployed, detailed delivery steps, and any prerequisites that need to be met before the deployment can proceed.
