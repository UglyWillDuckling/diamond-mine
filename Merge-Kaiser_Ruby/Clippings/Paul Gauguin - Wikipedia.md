**Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin** (; French: [\[øʒɛn ɑ̃ʁi pɔl ɡoɡɛ̃\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French "Help:IPA/French"); 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French painter, sculptor, [printmaker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaker "Printmaker"), [ceramist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramist "Ceramist"), and writer, whose work has been primarily associated with the [Post-Impressionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionist "Post-Impressionist") and [Symbolist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolism_\(arts\) "Symbolism (arts)") movements. He was also an influential practitioner of [wood engraving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_engraving "Wood engraving") and [woodcuts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcut "Woodcut") as art forms.[^1][^2] While only moderately successful during his lifetime, Gauguin has since been recognized for his experimental use of color and [Synthetist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetist "Synthetist") style that were distinct from [Impressionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism "Impressionism").

Gauguin was born in Paris in 1848, amidst the tumult of [Europe's revolutionary year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848"). In 1850, Gauguin's family settled in [Peru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"), where he experienced a privileged childhood that left a lasting impression on him. Later, financial struggles led them back to France, where Gauguin received formal education. Initially working as a stockbroker, Gauguin started painting in his spare time, his interest in art kindled by visits to [galleries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery "Art gallery") and [exhibitions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition "Exhibition"). The [financial crisis of 1882](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1884 "Panic of 1884") significantly impacted his brokerage career, prompting a full-time shift to painting. Gauguin's art education was largely [self-taught](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism "Autodidacticism") and informal, shaped significantly by his associations with other artists rather than [academic training](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art "Academic art"). His entry into the art world was facilitated by his acquaintance with [Camille Pissarro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Pissarro "Camille Pissarro"), a leading [Impressionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionist "Impressionist"). Pissarro took on a mentor role for Gauguin, introducing him to other Impressionist artists and techniques.

He exhibited with the Impressionists in the early 1880s, but soon began developing his distinct style, characterized by a bolder use of color and less traditional subject matter. His work in [Brittany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany "Brittany") and [Martinique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique "Martinique") showcased his inclination towards depicting [native life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples") and [landscapes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_painting "Landscape painting"). By the 1890s, Gauguin's art took a significant turn during his time in [Tahiti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti "Tahiti"), then a [French colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire "French colonial empire"), where he sought a refuge from the [Western civilization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_civilization "Western civilization"), driven by the [colonialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonialism "European colonialism") tropes of [exoticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoticism "Exoticism") prevalent at the time. During that time, he controversially married three adolescent [Tahitian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahitians "Tahitians") girls with whom he later fathered children.[^3] Gauguin's later years in Tahiti and the [Marquesas Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquesas_Islands "Marquesas Islands") were marked by health issues and financial struggles.

His paintings from that period, characterized by vivid colors and Symbolist themes, would prove highly successful among the European viewers for their exploration of the relationships between people, nature, and the [spiritual world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_world_\(Spiritualism\) "Spirit world (Spiritualism)"). Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of [dealer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_dealer "Art dealer") [Ambroise Vollard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroise_Vollard "Ambroise Vollard"), who organized [exhibitions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_exhibition "Art exhibition") of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.[^4][^5] His work was influential on the French [avant-garde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde "Avant-garde") and many modern artists, such as [Pablo Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso") and [Henri Matisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse "Henri Matisse"), and he is well known for his relationship with [Vincent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh "Vincent van Gogh") and [Theo van Gogh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_van_Gogh_\(art_dealer\) "Theo van Gogh (art dealer)").

## Historical significance

[Primitivism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitivism "Primitivism") was an art movement of late 19th-century painting and sculpture, characterized by exaggerated body proportions, animal totems, geometric designs, and stark contrasts. The first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin.[^238] The European cultural elite, discovering the art of Africa, Micronesia, and [Native Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") for the first time, were fascinated, intrigued, and educated by the newness, wildness, and the stark power embodied in the art of those faraway places. Like [Pablo Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso") in the early days of the 20th century, Gauguin was inspired and motivated by the raw power and simplicity of the so-called [Primitive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_culture "Primitive culture") Art of those foreign cultures.[^239]

Gauguin is also considered a [Post-Impressionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionist "Post-Impressionist") painter. His bold, colourful, and design oriented paintings significantly influenced [Modern art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art "Modern art"). Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include [Vincent van Gogh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh "Vincent van Gogh"), [Henri Matisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse "Henri Matisse"), [Pablo Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso"), [Georges Braque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Braque "Georges Braque"), [André Derain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Derain "André Derain"), [Fauvism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism "Fauvism"), [Cubism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism "Cubism"), and [Orphism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_\(art\) "Orphism (art)"), among others. Later, he influenced [Arthur Frank Mathews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Frank_Mathews "Arthur Frank Mathews") and the American [Arts and Crafts movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement "Arts and Crafts movement").

[John Rewald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rewald "John Rewald"), recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including *Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin* (1956) and an essay, *Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and André Fontainas* (included in Rewald's *Studies in Post-Impressionism*, 1986), discusses Gauguin's years in Tahiti and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others.[^240]
