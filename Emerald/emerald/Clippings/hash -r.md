  [[hash command]]
  
  The command "hash -r" is used in Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux
  and MacOS, to rebuild the hash table used by the shell to locate executable
  files more quickly.

  When you type the name of a command in the terminal, the shell uses the hash
  table to quickly locate the executable file associated with that command,
  without having to search through all the directories in your system's $PATH
  environment variable. The hash table is built and updated dynamically as you
  use commands, but sometimes it may become out of date or corrupted.

  The "hash -r" command rebuilds the hash table from scratch, which can be
  useful if you have added new directories to your $PATH variable or if you
  have moved or deleted executable files. This can help ensure that the shell
  is able to locate the correct executable files for the commands you type,
  improving the efficiency and accuracy of command execution.
