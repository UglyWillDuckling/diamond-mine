So… fair warning. This one’s rough—for all the obvious reasons, and some that crept up on me while I was making it. I tried to hold onto hope, I really did. But there’s grief in here. Grief for the stories stolen and the futures deliberately broken. And also personal grief. So fair warning before jumping into this one. I do think it ends hopeful.

That said - I’ve shown it to some friends—Aranock and a few others—who say it’s a good video. Maybe they’re right. But I have such mixed feelings about it. Not just emotionally, but even just structurally. It feels fractured to me. Uneven. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe that’s the shape power leaves us in.

Because power doesn’t just kill. It rewrites. It buries. It silences. This essay looks at how fascist and colonial systems erase history, not only through violence, but through the archive itself: who gets remembered, how, and why. From the boarding schools that tore Indigenous children from their families, to the erasure of trans lives from national memory, to the targeted destruction of Palestinian cultural sites - colonialism thrives on forgetting.

And it leaves behind broken timelines. Gaps where people should be. A story full of missing names and haunted places.

I hope, in some way, this video helps make sense of that mess. Or at least reminds you that you’re not alone inside it.
