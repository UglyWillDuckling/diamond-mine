Lyrics```
Look closely at the shadows on the ground beneath the trees
The labors of Hercules
Wild grasses on the hills
Rippling in the wind
Cybele unchained

The songs you sing at Christmastime
The stories that you tell
Well, I knew them well
Yes, I knew them well

Say your prayers to whomever you call out to in the night
Keep the chains tight
Make it through this year
If it kills you outright

The coins they toss at dancers whirling in the city square
 Music on the air
The places where we met to share our secrets now and then
We will see them again

Change will come
Stay warm inside the ripple of the Panasonic hum
It grinds and it roars
Headed somewhere better
If I have to crawl there on all fours

Say your prayers to whomever you call out to in the night
Keep the chains tight
Make it through this year
If it kills you outright
```

- "This is called 'Exegetic Chains', and any musical references you hear to my own stuff, to other people's stuff, Biblical references, are there on purpose... This is the last song on the tape, and it's called 'Exegetic Chains'." -- [YouTube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzMpxTechVI&t=4s)
- "I knew it was going to be the last one, and it was a phrase that Chuvin had used as he was wrapping up his book. Not wanting to be bound by exegetic chains in one's interpretation of history. And at this point -- I haven't read a text like this in years, but when I was a student of classics, I was a very excitable student.. I would read this stuff and get extremely excited. That sort of writing, that sort of thinking where you're deep enough inside your subject to say to your listener, well, look, let's not be bound by exegetic chains here, and the listener, instead of going, oh well, foofaraw, who's using fifty-cent words now, instead just goes 'I know what you're saying', right. I like being at that level of discourse with somebody, being able to share in that kind of discourse. And so -- but it's also still funny, it's always a little funny when you're, when you're in your academic-speak, right. I think it never stops being funny if you step back a little and make sure you don't -- I wrote that down, a perfect song title. But it immediately suggested, you know, readings. And that's what the song is about, about how to read things." -- [2020-06-15 - WNYC Session - New York, NY](https://themountaingoats.fandom.com/wiki/2020-06-15_-_WNYC_Session_-_New_York,_NY "2020-06-15 - WNYC Session - New York, NY")
