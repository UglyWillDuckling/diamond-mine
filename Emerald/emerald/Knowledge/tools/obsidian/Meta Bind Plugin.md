## Obsidian Meta Bind Plugin

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to make your notes interactive with inline **input fields**, **metadata displays (view fields)**, and **buttons**.

Meta Bind allows you to create input and view fields inside your notes. Those input and view fields can then be bound to frontmatter properties, which keeps them in sync with those frontmatter properties. This allows you to edit and view your frontmatter properties inside your notes.

For example, you can create a toggle inside your note, that is bound to a frontmatter property named `done`, with this simple inline code block `INPUT[toggle:done]`. When you click the toggle, the `done` property will switch between `true` and `false`.
