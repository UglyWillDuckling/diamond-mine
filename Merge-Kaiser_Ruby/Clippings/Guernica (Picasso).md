***Guernica*** is a large 1937 oil painting by Spanish artist [Pablo Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso").[^richardson_2016-1][^measures-2] It is one of his best-known works, regarded by many art critics as the most moving and powerful [anti-war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war "Anti-war") painting in history.[^3] It is exhibited in the [Museo Reina Sofía](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Reina_Sof%C3%ADa "Museo Reina Sofía") in [Madrid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid").[^4]

The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) across, portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos. Prominently featured in [the composition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Composition) are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.

Picasso painted *Guernica* at his home in [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") in response to the 26 April 1937 [bombing of Guernica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Guernica "Bombing of Guernica"), a town in the [Basque Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_\(autonomous_community\) "Basque Country (autonomous community)") in northern Spain, by [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") and [Fascist Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_\(1861%E2%80%931946\) "Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)"). Upon completion, *Guernica* was exhibited at the [Spanish pavilion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavell%C3%B3_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_CRAI_Library "Pavelló de la República CRAI Library") at the [1937 Paris International Exposition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Internationale_des_Arts_et_Techniques_dans_la_Vie_Moderne "Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne") and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.[^cohen_2003-5] The painting soon became widely acclaimed, helping to bring worldwide attention to the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") that took place from 1936 to 1939.

It is widely thought that [Surrealist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist "Surrealist") photographer and anti-fascist activist [Dora Maar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_Maar "Dora Maar"), Picasso’s romantic partner at the time, had a significant influence on the style and politicized theme of *Guernica*.[^:1-6]

In January 1937, while Pablo Picasso was living in Paris on [Rue des Grands Augustins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_des_Grands_Augustins "Rue des Grands Augustins"), he was commissioned by the [Spanish Republican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic "Second Spanish Republic") government to create a large artwork for the Spanish pavilion at the [Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Internationale_des_Arts_et_Techniques_dans_la_Vie_Moderne "Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne"), a 1937 Paris International Exposition.[^7] Picasso, who had last visited Spain in 1934 and would never return, was the Honorary Director-in-Exile of the [Prado Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prado_Museum "Prado Museum").[^timeline-8]

Picasso worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April on the project's initial sketches, which depicted his perennial theme of an artist's studio.[^richardson_2016-1] Then, immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, poet [Juan Larrea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Larrea_\(poet\) "Juan Larrea (poet)") visited Picasso's home to urge him to make the bombing his subject.[^richardson_2016-1] Days later, on 1 May, Picasso read [George Steer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Steer "George Steer")'s eyewitness account of the attack, which originally had been published in both *[The Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")* and *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* on 28 April, and abandoned his initial idea. Acting on Larrea's suggestion, Picasso began sketching a series of preliminary drawings for *Guernica*.[^9]

### Bombing of 26 April 1937

Guernica in ruins, 1937

During the Spanish Civil War the Republican forces, made up of communists, socialists, anarchists, and others with differing goals, united in their opposition to the Nationalists, led by General [Francisco Franco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco "Francisco Franco"), who sought to establish a fascist dictatorship. The Nationalists perceived [Guernica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_\(town\) "Guernica (town)"), a quiet village in the province of [Biscay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscay "Biscay") in Basque Country, as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture.[^arhheim1973-10]

On Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") [Condor Legion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor_Legion "Condor Legion"), commanded by Colonel [Wolfram von Richthofen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_von_Richthofen "Wolfram von Richthofen"), bombed Guernica for about two hours.[^ray2006-11][^arhheim1973-10] In his 30 April 1937 journal entry von Richthofen noted that when the squadron arrived "there was smoke everywhere" from the attack by three aircraft, and since nobody could see the roads, bridges, and suburbs "they just dropped everything right into the center. The 250s toppled a number of houses and destroyed the water mains. The incendiaries now could spread and become effective. The materials of the houses: tile roofs, wooden porches, and half-timbering resulted in complete annihilation."[^12]

Monday was Guernica's market day, and since most of its men were away fighting on behalf of the Republicans, at the time of the bombing the town was populated mostly by women and children,[^preston2007-13] many of whom were congregated in the center of town. When the main bombardment began the roads were already full of debris and the bridges leading out of town destroyed, and the residents were unable to escape.

Guernica, the capital of [Biscay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscay "Biscay"), was 10 kilometers from the front lines and in-between the front lines and Bilbao. A Republican retreat towards Bilbao, or an advance towards it, had to pass through Guernica.[^14] Richthofen's 26 April 1937 diary entry states the town was targeted "...to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here." The following day, Richthofen wrote in his diary, "Guernica burning".[^beevor233-15] The nearest miliary target, a war product factory on Guernica's outskirts, went through the attack unscathed, so the attack was widely condemned as a terror bombing.[^16][^17]

Damage sustained during the air attack

*The Times* journalist [George Steer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Steer "George Steer") propelled this event onto the international scene, and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention, in an eyewitness account published on 28 April in both *The Times* and *The New York Times*. On the 29th it appeared in *[L'Humanité](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Humanit%C3%A9 "L'Humanité")*. Steer wrote:

> Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basques and the centre of their cultural tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium incendiary projectiles. The fighters, meanwhile, plunged low from above the centre of the town to machinegun those of the civilian population who had taken refuge in the fields."[^preston2007-13]

Picasso lived in Paris during its World War II [German occupation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_military_administration_in_occupied_France_during_World_War_II "German military administration in occupied France during World War II"). A widely repeated story is that a German officer saw a photo of *Guernica* in Picasso's apartment and asked, "Did you do that?", and Picasso responded, "No, you did."[^18]

Referring to Picasso's painting, art theorist [Rudolf Arnheim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Arnheim "Rudolf Arnheim") writes:

> The women and children make *Guernica* the image of innocent, defenseless humanity victimized. Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind.[^arhheim1973-10]

## Creation and the influence of Dora Maar on the painting

## Symbolism and interpretations

## Establishment in Spain

As early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having *Guernica* come to Spain.[^timeline-8] However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of "public liberties and democratic institutions". Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic [constitutional monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy"), ratified by [a new constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1978 "Spanish Constitution of 1978") in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981. The Spanish historian [Javier Tusell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Tusell "Javier Tusell") was one of the negotiators.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Upon its arrival in Spain in September 1981,[^uned-51] it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens[^52] at the [Casón del Buen Retiro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas%C3%B3n_del_Buen_Retiro "Casón del Buen Retiro") in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, 25 October.[^uned-51] The exhibition was visited by almost a million people in the first year.[^53] Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.

A tiled wall in Gernika claims *"Guernica" Gernikara*, "The *Guernica* (painting) to Gernika"

In 1992, the painting was moved from the [Museo del Prado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_del_Prado "Museo del Prado") to a purpose-built gallery at the [Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Nacional_Centro_de_Arte_Reina_Sof%C3%ADa "Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía"), both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works.[^his-54] This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso's will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to. At the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.[^martin-55]

[Basque nationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_nationalism "Basque nationalism") have advocated that the picture be brought to the Basque Country,[^elmundoibarretxe-56] especially after the building of the [Guggenheim Bilbao Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Bilbao_Museum "Guggenheim Bilbao Museum"). Officials at the Reina Sofía claim[^elmundomncars-57] that the canvas is now thought to be too fragile to move. Even the staff of the Guggenheim do not see a permanent transfer of the painting as possible, although the Basque government continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in [Bilbao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao "Bilbao").[^martin-55]

## Tapestry at the United Nations

A full-size [tapestry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry "Tapestry") copy of Picasso's *Guernica*, by [Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_de_la_Baume_D%C3%BCrrbach "Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach"),[^ipog-58] hangs at the [Headquarters of the United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations "Headquarters of the United Nations") in [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") at the entrance to the [Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council") room.[^cbsreturns-59] It is less monochromatic than the original and uses several shades of brown.

The *Guernica* tapestry was first displayed from 1985 to 2009, and returned in 2015. Originally commissioned in 1955 by [Nelson Rockefeller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller "Nelson Rockefeller"), since Picasso refused to sell him the original,[^60] the tapestry was placed on loan to the United Nations by the Rockefeller estate in 1985.[^61]

On 5 February 2003 a large blue curtain was placed to cover over the work at the UN, so that it would not be visible in the background during press conferences by [Colin Powell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell "Colin Powell") and [John Negroponte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Negroponte "John Negroponte") as they were arguing in favor of war on Iraq.[^62] On the following day, UN officials claimed that the curtain was placed there at the request of television news crews, who had complained that the wild lines and screaming figures made for a bad backdrop, and that a horse's hindquarters appeared just above the faces of any speakers. Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq.[^cohen_2003-5] In a critique of the covering, columnist Alejandro Escalona hypothesized that *Guernica*'s "unappealing ménage of mutilated bodies and distorted faces proved to be too strong for articulating to the world why the US was going to war in Iraq", while referring to the work as "an inconvenient masterpiece".[^75years-26]

On 17 March 2009, Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Marie Okabe announced that the *Guernica* tapestry had been moved to a gallery in London in advance of extensive renovations at UN Headquarters. The *Guernica* tapestry was the showcase piece for the grand reopening of the [Whitechapel Gallery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitechapel_Gallery "Whitechapel Gallery"). It was located in the 'Guernica room' which was originally part of the old Whitechapel Library.[^63] In 2012 the tapestry was on loan from the Rockefeller family to the [San Antonio Museum of Art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Museum_of_Art "San Antonio Museum of Art") in [San Antonio, Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio,_Texas "San Antonio, Texas").[^64] It was returned to the UN by March 2015.[^65] Nelson A. Rockefeller Jr., the owner of the tapestry, took it back in February 2021.[^66] In February 2022, it was returned to the wall outside the UN Security Council.[^cbsreturns-59]

## Significance and legacy

> "*Guernica* is to painting what [Beethoven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven "Ludwig van Beethoven")'s [Ninth Symphony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_\(Beethoven\) "Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)") is to music: a cultural icon that speaks to mankind not only against war but also of hope and peace. It is a reference when speaking about genocide from [El Salvador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre "El Mozote massacre") to [Bosnia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre "Srebrenica massacre")."

Alejandro Escalona, on the 75th anniversary of the painting's creation[^75years-26]

During the 1970s, *Guernica* was a symbol for Spaniards of both the end of the Franco regime following Franco's death and of [Basque nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_nationalism "Basque nationalism"). The [Basque left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_National_Liberation_Movement "Basque National Liberation Movement") has repeatedly used imagery from the picture. An example is the organization [Etxerat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etxerat "Etxerat"), which uses a reversed image of the lamp as its symbol.[^67] *Guernica* has since become a universal and powerful symbol warning humanity against the suffering and devastation of war.[^75years-26] There are no obvious references to the specific attack, making its message universal and timeless.[^75years-26]

Art historian and curator [W. J. H. B. Sandberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Sandberg "Willem Sandberg") argued in *[Daedalus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus_\(journal\) "Daedalus (journal)")* in 1960 that Picasso pioneered a "new language" combining expressionistic and cubist techniques in *Guernica*. Sandberg wrote that *Guernica* conveyed an “expressionistic message” in its focus on the inhumanity of the air raid, while using "the language of cubism". For Sandberg, the work's defining cubist features included its use of diagonals, which rendered the painting's setting "ambiguous, unreal, inside and outside at the same time".[^picasso's_guernica-19] In 2016, the British art critic [Jonathan Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Jones_\(journalist\) "Jonathan Jones (journalist)") called the painting a "Cubist apocalypse" and stated that Picasso "was trying to show the truth so viscerally and permanently that it could outstare the daily lies of the age of dictators".[^68][^69]

Works inspired by *Guernica* include [Faith Ringgold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Ringgold "Faith Ringgold")'s 1967 painting *[The American People Series #20: Die](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_People_Series_20:_Die "The American People Series 20: Die")*; [Goshka Macuga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshka_Macuga "Goshka Macuga")'s *The Nature of the Beast* (2009–2010), which used the Whitechapel-hosted [United Nations *Guernica* tapestry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Tapestry_at_the_United_Nations); *The Keiskamma Guernicas* (2010–2017); and Erica Luckert's theatrical production of *Guernica* (2011–2012).[^:0-70][^wapo_review-71] Art and design historian Dr Nicola Ashmore curated an exhibition, *Guernica Remakings*, at the [University of Brighton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Brighton "University of Brighton") galleries from 29 July 2017 to 23 August 2017.[^:0-70]
