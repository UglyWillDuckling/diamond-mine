### **Delete** Team

### **Create a Role**
points: 5

I want to be able to create a new role of users, 
So that I could configure teams structure and user levels correctly.

Acceptance criteria:

The user can access create a new role option from **ROLES** tab of User management.

When the user clicks on â€œCreate a new role", 
Then he can enter:
- roleâ€™s name
- select permissions for that role from the list of permissions available.

The user has to update the name of the role, otherwise the role cannot be saved.
Once he saves, the role is now available to be assigned to users of Luqa.

### List Permissions
