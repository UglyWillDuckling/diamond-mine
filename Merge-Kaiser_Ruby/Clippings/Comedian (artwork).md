Number two of the limited edition of three was sold to [cryptocurrency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency") entrepreneur [Justin Sun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sun "Justin Sun") for $6.2 million in November 2024.[^nbc_2024-1][^2][^3] Soon afterward, he ate the banana onstage, comparing it to a crypto asset and saying, "the real value is the concept itself".[^4] Sun also stated that he would buy 100,000 bananas from the street vendor in front of Sotheby's who sold the banana used in the most recent refresh of the artwork.[^5]

The piece and one of its sisters had previously sold for US$120,000 each at [Art Basel Miami Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Basel "Art Basel") to significant media attention. The third edition was donated to the [Guggenheim Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Museum "Guggenheim Museum").[^francesco_bonami-6]

## Background and description

[Maurizio Cattelan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Cattelan "Maurizio Cattelan") is an Italian artist known for his [tongue-in-cheek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek "Tongue-in-cheek") art, such as his 2016 creation *[America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_\(Maurizio_Cattelan\) "America (Maurizio Cattelan)")*, a fully functional golden toilet.[^sutton-7] He previously used [duct tape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_tape "Duct tape") suspension for *A Perfect Day* in 1999, fastening the art dealer [Massimo De Carlo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_De_Carlo "Massimo De Carlo") to a gallery wall.[^8][^9] At the 2019 [Foire Internationale d'Art Contemporain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foire_Internationale_d%27Art_Contemporain "Foire Internationale d'Art Contemporain") art fair in Paris, the American conceptual [interventionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_intervention "Art intervention") Meth Fountain showed a half-eaten croissant affixed to the wall, predating *Comedian* by several months.[^casconesarah-10]

*Comedian* is a piece consisting of a fresh banana duct taped to a wall[^description_artnet-11] exactly 1.6 metres above the floor.[^nbc_2024-1] Cattelan purchased the bananas at a Miami grocery store for an estimated 30 cents.[^o'neil-12] The work includes a [certificate of authenticity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_authenticity "Certificate of authenticity") along with detailed instructions for its proper display, intended for its owner to use when displaying the work. The banana and the duct tape can be replaced as needed; the physical representation of *Comedian* is not the work itself.[^the_art_newspaper_2020-13] It was Cattelan's first artwork for a fair in over 15 years.[^harris-14] The piece was compared to [Andy Warhol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol "Andy Warhol")'s 1967 pop art fruit.[^chin-15] [Emmanuel Perrotin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Perrotin "Emmanuel Perrotin"), the gallerist exhibiting the work, stated *Comedian* is "a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humor".[^sullivan-16]

*Comedian* created controversy, with some writers, such as [Robin Pogrebin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Pogrebin "Robin Pogrebin"), questioning if it was even art.[^design_bloom-17][^pogrebin-18] *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* called *Comedian* a "questionably genius work. ... It calls to mind the old Lucile Bluth *[Arrested Development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development "Arrested Development")* gag about rich people not knowing the price of a banana."[^o'neil-12] *[Artnet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artnet "Artnet")* wrote the piece was one of the worst of the week, and that Cattelan "somehow duped a group of collectors into buying bananas duct-taped to walls for $120,000 a pop. Seriously."[^goldstein-19] *[USA Today](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today "USA Today")* deadpanned, "This piece of art is bananas – literally."[^moniuszko-20] *[Newsweek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek "Newsweek")* called it "humorous minimalist artwork",[^ahmed-21] while *[ARTnews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTnews "ARTnews")* asked whether the piece was cynical or thrilling.[^russeth-22] [CBS News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News "CBS News") reported, "It may be the most talked-about artwork at this year's event."[^larnaud-23] On December 13, the *[New York Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post "New York Post")* featured *Comedian* on its cover.[^bishara-24] In his 2021 book *The Devil in the Gallery*, [Noah Charney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Charney "Noah Charney") stated, "*Comedian* is neither beautiful nor does it exhibit skill, so it represents the [Duchampian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp "Marcel Duchamp") path."[^charney-25] In his book *Beauty (and the Banana)*, author [Brian C. Nixon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_C._Nixon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Brian C. Nixon (page does not exist)") stated, "To say the least, *Comedian* is a commentary on the wild world of contemporary art, communicating how culture understands, interprets, and engages with the arts."[^wipf-26]

The piece was released in an edition of three; two were purchased for $120,000 USD each at [Art Basel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Basel "Art Basel").[^casconebanana-27] The selling price garnered significant media attention. One edition was purchased by Sarah Andelman, a founder of [Colette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colette_\(boutique\) "Colette (boutique)").[^pes-28]

In August 2020, artist [Damien Hirst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst "Damien Hirst") complained to the media that he was unable to purchase the piece and had offered to trade any of his own works for it with Cattelan; Cattelan replied that the piece had sold out.[^29][^shawanny-30] The following month *Comedian* was donated to the [Guggenheim Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum "Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum"), with instructions and diagrams for its installation and display.[^the_art_newspaper_2020-13]

Following a highly publicized tour and bidding, *Comedian* sold at Sotheby's during "The Now and Contemporary Evening Auction" on 20 November 2024 for $5,200,000 ($6,240,000 after fees), well above its $1,000,000-$1,500,000 estimate.[^31] The purchaser was cryptocurrency entrepreneur [Justin Sun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sun "Justin Sun").[^32] On 29 November, Sun ate the banana at a press conference at the [Peninsula Hotel, Hong Kong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Hotel,_Hong_Kong "Peninsula Hotel, Hong Kong").[^33] He retains the right to recreate the artwork at any time, but not multiple co-existing copies.

[Manhattan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan") fruit vendor Shah Alam sold the banana used in the work for 25 cents. Alam expressed surprise and disbelief when informed of the sale, stating, "I am a poor man. I have never had this kind of money. I have never seen this kind of money".[^34]

After its sale, while still on exhibit at Art Basel, Georgian performance artist [David Datuna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Datuna "David Datuna") ate the piece in [an intervention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_intervention "Art intervention") he called *Hungry Artist*. The banana was replaced later that day.[^cohen-35][^darby-36] No legal action was taken against him, though he was asked to leave the fair.[^times_of_israel-37] Datuna stated, "What we perceive as materialism is nothing but social conditioning. Any meaningful interaction with an object could turn it to art. I am a hungry artist, and I am hungry for new interactions."[^eatingbanana-38]

In April 2023, the piece located in the [Leeum Museum of Art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeum,_Samsung_Museum_of_Art "Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art") was eaten by a student, Noh Hyun-soo, who then taped the peel back onto the wall. When asked why he ate it, he said that he had skipped breakfast that day and was hungry.[^39]

Following a flurry of publicity, several commentators satirized or interpreted *Comedian*. Designer [Sebastian ErraZuriz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_ErraZuriz "Sebastian ErraZuriz") taped a dildo to a wall with duct tape and listed it for sale for $12,000.[^gibson-40] [Cryptocurrency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency") artist CryptoGraffiti created *The Commodity*, "which instructed collectors to find and claim a banana with a bitcoin key address carved into it".[^casconesarah-10] Actress [Brooke Shields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Shields "Brooke Shields") taped a banana to her forehead with blue tape and posted it to [Instagram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram "Instagram") with the caption, "An expensive [selfie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie "Selfie")".[^ilchi-41] Designer [Simon Porte Jacquemus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Porte_Jacquemus "Simon Porte Jacquemus") "created a merch opportunity when posting a duct-taped yellow version of \[his\] micro Le Chiquito bag".[^ilchi-41] [Popeyes Chicken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeyes_Chicken "Popeyes Chicken") joined with the San Paul Gallery Urban Art in Miami to create *The Sandwich*, a chicken sandwich taped to a white wall with duct tape; it was listed at $120,003.99 and "became a viral sensation in its own right".[^casconesarah-10][^zhang-42] Multiple other brands followed suit, including the [New York Mets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets "New York Mets"), [Burger King](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King "Burger King"), [Hostess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostess_Brands "Hostess Brands"), [Perrier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrier "Perrier"), [Carrefour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrefour "Carrefour"), [Sweetgreen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetgreen "Sweetgreen"), [Absolut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolut "Absolut"), and [Bobbi Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbi_Brown "Bobbi Brown").[^liffreing_ad_age-43]

Artist Joe Morford filed a suit against Cattelan for [copyright infringement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement "Copyright infringement") of his 2000 work titled *Banana & Orange*.[^48][^49] *Banana & Orange* features plastic replicas of the titular fruits duct taped to two green panels.[^theartnewspaper.com-50] Given Morford's claimed similarities between *Comedian* and *Banana & Orange*, Morford pursued a claim of copyright infringement, alleging that *Comedian* unfairly copied *Banana & Orange*.[^51] Morford further claimed that Cattelan might have seen his work and been influenced by it. On June 9, 2023, Judge Robert N. Scolar, Jr., a US district judge for the southern district of Florida, granted Cattelan's motion for [summary judgment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment "Summary judgment"), closing the case prior to trial.[^theartnewspaper.com-50][^52]
