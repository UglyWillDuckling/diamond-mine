**Kurtz** is a fictional character in [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad")'s 1899 novella *[Heart of Darkness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness "Heart of Darkness")*. A European [ivory trader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade "Ivory trade") in [Central Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa "Central Africa") and commander of a trading post, he monopolizes his position as a [demigod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigod "Demigod") among native Africans. Kurtz meets with the novella's [protagonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist "Protagonist"), [Charles Marlow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Marlow "Charles Marlow"), who returns him to the coast via [steamboat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat "Steamboat"). Kurtz, whose reputation precedes him, impresses Marlow strongly, and during the return journey, Marlow is witness to Kurtz's final moments.

Ivory trade in East Africa around 1890.

Kurtz is an [ivory trader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade "Ivory trade"), sent by a shadowy Belgian company into the heart of an unnamed place in Africa (generally regarded as the [Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State "Congo Free State")). With the help of his superior technology, Kurtz has turned himself into a charismatic demigod of all the tribes surrounding his station and gathered vast quantities of ivory in this way. As a result, his name is known throughout the region. Kurtz's general manager is envious of Kurtz and plots his downfall.

Kurtz's mother was half [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people "English people"), his father was half [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people "French people") and thus "All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz." As the reader finds out at the end, Kurtz is a multitalented man—painter, musician, writer, promising politician. He starts out, years before the novel begins, as an [imperialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism") in the best tradition of the "[white man's burden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_man%27s_burden "White man's burden")". The reader is introduced to a painting of Kurtz's, depicting a blindfolded woman bearing a torch against a nearly black background, and clearly symbolic of his former views. Kurtz's painting suggests that he saw himself as a civilizing force, aiming to educate and enlighten the African continent, which was then often referred to as the "dark continent" due to its perceived unknownness and perceived backwardness by European colonizers.[^1] Kurtz is also the author of a pamphlet regarding the civilization of the natives. The presence of his admirer, the Russian "Harlequin", and what he reveals about Kurtz in his adulatory descriptions of him raises questions about Kurtz's actual beliefs and the sincerity of his progressive views.[^2]

However, over the course of his stay in Africa, Kurtz becomes corrupted. He takes his pamphlet and scribbles in, at the very end, the words "Exterminate all the brutes!" He induces the natives to worship him, setting up rituals and venerations worthy of a tyrant. By the time Marlow, the protagonist, sees Kurtz, he is ill with jungle fever and almost dead. Marlow seizes Kurtz and endeavours to take him back down the river in his steamboat. Kurtz dies on the boat with the last words, "The horror! The horror!" Kurtz ultimately was changed by the jungle. At first, he wanted to bring civilization to the natives, as his painting shows, but by the end it seems he wants to "exterminate" them.

[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Musgrave_Barttelot "Edmund Musgrave Barttelot"), who became notorious for his brutality, is one of the historical persons that may have inspired Kurtz's persona.

Kurtz's persona is generally understood to derive from the notoriously brutal history of the so-called [Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State "Congo Free State"), a territory that existed as the private property of [King Leopold II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Leopold_II "King Leopold II") from 1885 to 1908 until it was taken over by Belgium and became a Belgian colony. In his book *[King Leopold's Ghost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Leopold%27s_Ghost "King Leopold's Ghost")*, historian [Adam Hochschild](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Hochschild "Adam Hochschild") suggests that [Léon Rom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Rom "Léon Rom"), an administrator in the Congo Free State, was the principal inspiration for the Kurtz character, citing references as the heads on the stakes outside of the station and other similarities between the two.

Hochschild and other authors have also suggested that the fate of the disastrous "rear column" of the [Emin Pasha Relief Expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin_Pasha_Relief_Expedition "Emin Pasha Relief Expedition") (1886–1888) on the Congo may have also been an influence. Column leader [Edmund Musgrave Barttelot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Musgrave_Barttelot "Edmund Musgrave Barttelot"), "went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered". Harold Bloom notes that Kurtz's sophisticated brutality is closer to that of Barttelot's associate, slave trader [Tippu Tip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippu_Tip "Tippu Tip"). The rear column's Scottish naturalist, [James Sligo Jameson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sligo_Jameson "James Sligo Jameson"), who died in the Congo a few months after watching while a slave girl for whom he had paid was killed and eaten by [cannibals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cannibalism "Human cannibalism"), has also been suggested.[^3][^4][^5] The expedition's overall leader, [Henry Morton Stanley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morton_Stanley "Henry Morton Stanley"), the principal figure involved in preparing the Congo for Leopold's rule, may also have been an influence.[^6][^7]

Conrad's biographer [Norman Sherry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Sherry "Norman Sherry") judged that Arthur Hodister (1847–1892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by Congolese to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis.[^8][^9][^10] Peter Firchow mentions the possibility that Kurtz is a composite, modelled on various figures present in the Congo Free State at the time as well as on Conrad's imagining of what they might have had in common.[^footnotefirchow201567%e2%80%9368-11]

A personal acquaintance of Conrad's, Georges Antoine Klein, may also have been a real-life basis for the character.[^12] Klein was an employee of the [Brussels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")\-based trading company *[Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_Anonyme_Belge_pour_le_Commerce_du_Haut-Congo "Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo")*, and died shortly after being picked up on the steamboat Conrad was piloting. Further, *klein* means "little" in German, and as Marlow muses in the novella, *kurz* means "short" in the same language.

Conrad also expressed admiration of [Robert Louis Stevenson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson "Robert Louis Stevenson")'s Pacific Ocean writings, in particular, the stories "[The Beach of Falesá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_of_Fales%C3%A1 "The Beach of Falesá")" and *[The Ebb-Tide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ebb-Tide "The Ebb-Tide")*, as well as the non-fiction account of [Tembinok'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tembinok%27 "Tembinok'") of the [Gilbert Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Islands "Gilbert Islands") that appeared in *[In the South Seas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson#Final_years_in_the_Pacific "Robert Louis Stevenson")*. All three texts contain [megalomaniacs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/megalomaniac "wiktionary:megalomaniac") who manipulate their circumstances and remote settings to assert power over others. It is widely believed<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.
