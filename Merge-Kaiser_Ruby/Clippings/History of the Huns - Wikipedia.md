The **history of the Huns** spans the time from before their first secure recorded appearance in Europe around 370 AD to after the disintegration of their empire around 469. The [Huns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns "Huns") likely entered Western Asia shortly before 370, from [Central Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia"): they first conquered the [Goths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths "Goths") and the [Alans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alans "Alans"), pushing a number of tribes to seek refuge within the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"). In the following years, the Huns conquered most of the [Germanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples "Germanic peoples") and [Scythian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians "Scythians") tribes outside of the borders of the Roman Empire. They also launched invasions of both the Asian provinces of Rome and the [Sasanian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire "Sasanian Empire") in 375. Under [Uldin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uldin "Uldin"), the first Hunnic ruler named in contemporary sources, the Huns launched a first unsuccessful large-scale raid into the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire") in Europe in 408. From the 420s, the Huns were led by the brothers [Octar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octar "Octar") and [Ruga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugila "Rugila"), who both cooperated with and threatened the Romans. Upon Ruga's death in 435, his nephews [Bleda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleda "Bleda") and [Attila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila "Attila") became the new rulers of the Huns, and launched a successful raid into the Eastern Roman Empire before making peace and securing an annual tribute and trading raids under the [Treaty of Margus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Margus "Treaty of Margus"). Attila appears to have killed his brother, and became sole ruler of the Huns in 445. He would go on to rule for the next eight years, launching a devastating raid on the Eastern Roman Empire in 447, followed by an invasion of [Gaul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul "Gaul") in 451. Attila is traditionally held to have been defeated in Gaul at the [Battle of the Catalaunian Fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Catalaunian_Fields "Battle of the Catalaunian Fields"), however some scholars hold the battle to have been a draw or Hunnic victory. The following year, the Huns invaded Italy and encountered no serious resistance before turning back.

Territory under Hunnic control, c. 450 AD

Hunnic dominion over Barbarian Europe is traditionally held to have collapsed suddenly after the death of Attila the year after the invasion of Italy. The Huns themselves are usually thought to have disappeared after the death of his son [Dengizich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengizich "Dengizich") in 469. However, some scholars have argued that the [Bulgars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars "Bulgars") in particular show a high degree of continuity with the Huns. [Hyun Jin Kim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyun_Jin_Kim "Hyun Jin Kim") has argued that the three major Germanic tribes to emerge from the Hunnic empire, the [Gepids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepids "Gepids"), the [Ostrogoths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths "Ostrogoths"), and the [Sciri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciri "Sciri"), were all heavily Hunnicized, and may have had Hunnic rather than native rulers even after the end of Hunnic dominion in Europe.

It is possible that the Huns were directly or indirectly responsible for the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire"), and they have been directly or indirectly linked to the dominance of Turkic tribes on the [Eurasian steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_steppe "Eurasian steppe") following the fourth century.

"The Death of Attila" by [Ferenc Paczka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ferenc_Paczka&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ferenc Paczka (page does not exist)")

In 453, Attila was reportedly planning a major campaign against the Eastern Romans to force them to resume paying tribute.[^footnoteheather2005342-155] However, he died unexpectedly, reportedly of a hemorrhage during his wedding to a new bride.[^footnoteheather2005342-155] He may also have been planning an invasion of the [Sasanian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire "Sasanian Empire"); Martin Schottky claims that "Attila’s death in 453 C.E. saved the Sasanians from an armed encounter with the Huns while they were at the height of their military power".[^footnoteschottky2004-156] Peter Heather, however, finds it unlikely that the Huns would have actually attacked Persia.[^footnoteheather2005334%e2%80%93335-130]

According to Jordanes, Attila's death precipitated a power struggle between his sons – it is unknown how many there were in total, but ancient sources mention three by name: [Ellac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellac "Ellac"), [Dengizich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengizich "Dengizich") and [Ernak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernak "Ernak").[^footnoteheather2005353%e2%80%93354-157] The brothers began fighting one another, and this caused the [Gepids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepids "Gepids") under [Ardaric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardaric "Ardaric") to rebel. The Huns under Ellac then fought the Gepids and were defeated, resulting in Ellac's death.[^footnoteheather2005354-158] According to Jordanes, this occurred at the [Battle of Nedao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nedao "Battle of Nedao") in 454, however, Heather speculates that there may have been more than just a single battle.[^footnoteheather2005354-158] Some tribes, such as the [Sciri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciri "Sciri"), fought on the Huns' side against the Gepids.[^footnotekim2015117%e2%80%93118-159] He also notes that, while 454 may have been a significant turning point, it by no means ended Hunnic rule over most of their subject peoples.[^footnoteheather2005355%e2%80%93356-160] According to Heather, rather than an immediate collapse, the end of Hunnic rule was a slow process whereby the Huns gradually lost control over their subject peoples.[^footnoteheather2005358-161]

The Huns continued to exist under Attila's sons Dengizich and Ernak.[^footnotekim2015123-162] Kim argues that Dengizich had successfully reestablished Hunnic rule over the western part of their empire in 464.[^footnotekim2015125-163] In 466, Dengizich demanded that Constantinople resume paying tribute to the Huns and reestablish the Huns' trading rights with the Romans. The Romans refused, however.[^footnotethompson1996172-164] Dengizich then decided to invade the Roman empire, with Ernak declining to join him to focus on other wars.[^footnotethompson1996172-164] Kim suggests that Ernak was distracted by the invasion of the [Saragurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saragurs "Saragurs") and other [Oghurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghur_\(tribe\) "Oghur (tribe)"), who had defeated the Akatziri in 463.[^footnotekim2015126-165] Without his brother, Dengizich was forced to rely on the recently conquered Ostrogoths and the "unreliable" Bittigur tribe.[^footnotekim2015126-165] His forces also included the Hunnic tribes of the Ultzinzures, Angiscires, and Bardores.[^footnotegolden199292-166] The Romans were able to encourage the Goths in his army to revolt, forcing Dengizich to retreat.[^footnotekim2015126-165] He died in 469, with Kim believing he was murdered, and his head was sent to the Romans.[^footnotekim2015126-165] [Anagastes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagast "Anagast"), the son of [Arnegisclus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnegisclus "Arnegisclus") who was slain by Attila, brought Dengzich's head to Constantinople and paraded it through the streets before mounting it on a stake in the [Hippodrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople "Hippodrome of Constantinople").[^footnotemaenchen-helfen1973168-167] This was the end of Hunnic rule in the West.[^footnotekim2015125-163]

### Germanic tribes as successors to the Huns in the West

Kim argues that the war after the death of Attila was actually a rebellion of the western half of the Hunnic empire, led by Ardaric, against the eastern half, led by Ellac as leader of the Akatziri Huns.[^footnotekim201392-168] He further argues that Ardaric, in common with the other leaders of the Gepids, was actually a Hun and not of Germanic origin; he notes that bones from the Gepid period frequently show Asiatic features among the ruling elite.[^footnotekim201511-169] He also notes that Gepid rule in the [Carpathian Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Basin "Carpathian Basin") appears to have differed little from that of the Huns.[^footnotekim201395-170] Ardaric's grandson [Mundo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundo_\(general\) "Mundo (general)") is identified in sources both as a Hun and as a Gepid.[^footnotekim2015112-171] Kim explains the fact that Ardaric's kingdom was identified as a Gepid rather than a Hunnic kingdom from the fact that the western part of the Hunnic empire had been almost entirely Germanic in population.[^footnotekim2015113-172]

The Sciri also emerged from Attila's empire with a potentially Hunnic King: [Edeko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edeco "Edeco") is first encountered in sources as Attila's envoy, and is variously identified as having a Hunnic or Thuringian mother.[^footnoteheather2005357-173] While Heather believes that the latter is more likely, Kim argues that Edeco was in fact a Hun and that Thuringian in the source is a mistake for [Torcilingi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torcilingi "Torcilingi").[^footnotekim201596%e2%80%9399-174] Accordingly, his sons [Hunoulph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onoulphus "Onoulphus") ("Hun-wolf") and [Odoacer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer "Odoacer"), who would go on to conquer Italy, would also be Huns ethnically, though the armies they led were certainly mostly Germanic.[^footnotekim201599%e2%80%93100-175] Odoacer would also conquer the *Rogii*, a tribe typically identified with the [Rugii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugii "Rugii") found in [Tacitus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus "Tacitus")' [*Germania*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_\(book\) "Germania (book)"), but whom Kim holds far more likely to be a newly formed tribe that was named after the Hunnic king [Ruga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugila "Rugila").[^footnotekim2015101%e2%80%93105-176]

The Goths led by the [Amali dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amali_dynasty "Amali dynasty") under their king [Valamir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valamir "Valamir") also became independent some time after 454. This did not include all Goths, however, some of whom are recorded as continuing to fight with the Huns as late as 468.[^footnoteheather2005356-177] Kim argues that even the Amali-led Goths remained loyal to the Huns until 459, when Valamir's nephew [Theoderic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoderic_the_Great "Theoderic the Great") was sent as a hostage to Constantinople, or even 461, when Valimir made an alliance with the Romans.[^footnotekim201311-178] Heather argues that the Amali united various groups of Goths sometime after Attila's death, though Jordanes claims that he did it while Attila was still alive.[^footnoteheather2005356%e2%80%93357-179] As he has for Ardaric and Ediko, Kim argues that Valimir, who is first attested as a confidant of Attila, was actually a Hun.[^footnotekim2013106%e2%80%93112-180] Around 464, Valamir's Goths fought the Sciri, resulting in Valamir's death – this in turn caused the Goths to virtually destroy the Sciri.[^footnoteheather2005358-161] Dengizich then intervened – Kim supposes that the Sciri appealed to him for help, and that they together defeated the Goths.[^footnotekim2013119-181] In a battle dated by Jordanes to 465, but by Kim to 470 after the death of Dengizich,[^footnotekim2015127-182] the Sciri led an alliance of various tribes, including the [Suebi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suebi "Suebi"), Rogii, Gepids, and [Sarmatians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatians "Sarmatians") against the Goths at the [Battle of Bolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bolia "Battle of Bolia").[^footnoteheather2005358%e2%80%93359-183] The Gothic victory confirmed their independence and the end of Hunnic rule in the West.[^footnotekim2015125-163]

Therefore, despite the collapse of the Western Hunnic Empire, Kim argues that the most important Barbarian leaders in Europe after Attila were all themselves Huns or were closely associated with Attila's empire.[^footnotekim2015132-184] However, Warwick Ball argues that Kim relies on circular arguments and overstates the amount of influence the Huns had on the Germanic peoples.[^footnoteball2021194%e2%80%93195-185]

### Potential continuation of Hunnic rule in the East

It is unclear what happened to Attila's youngest son Ernak.[^footnotegolden199292-166] Heather states that Ernak and a group of Huns were settled, with Roman permission, in northern [Dobruja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja "Dobruja").[^footnoteheather2005359%e2%80%93360-186] Maenchen-Helfen notes that Ernak seems to have left this territory at some time before Dengizich's invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire.[^footnotemaenchen-helfen1973166-187] The rulers of the [Bulgars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars "Bulgars"), a Turkic nomadic people who first appear in historical sources around 480,[^footnotekim2013137-188] may have claimed to be descended from Attila via Ernak, as recorded in the [Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalia_of_the_Bulgarian_khans "Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans").[^footnotegolden1992103-189] Kim and Denis Sinor argue that Ernak combined the remaining Huns with new Oghur-speaking Turkic tribes that had been pushed east from the steppe to form the Bulgars.[^footnotekim2013132-190][^footnotesinor1990198%e2%80%93199-191] Kim also argues that the [Kutrigurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutrigurs "Kutrigurs") and [Utigurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utigurs "Utigurs"), often considered a separate people, were in fact simply part of the Hunno-Bulgar state.[^footnotekim2015136-192] While many scholars dismiss medieval sources that refer to people after Dengizich's demise as Huns,[^footnoter%c3%b3na-tas1999309-193] Kim argues that these designations accurately describe the identity of the people in question, at least during the sixth century.[^footnotekim2013138-194]

Ancient sources appear to indicate that not all Hunnic peoples were incorporated into Ernak's Bulgar state.[^footnotesinor1990199-195] Huns continue to appear as mercenaries and allies of both the [Persians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire "Sasanian Empire") and Romans in the sixth century as well.[^footnotekim2013139%e2%80%93140-196] The Hunnic Altziagiri tribes continued to inhabit the [Crimea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea "Crimea") near [Cherson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chersonesus "Chersonesus").[^footnotekim2013141-197] Jordanes mentions two groups descended from Dengizich's Huns living on Roman territory, the Fossatisii and Sacromontisi.[^footnotesinor1990199-195] Kim, however, argues that we can distinguish just four large tribal groupings of Huns after the death of Dengizich; he argues that these were likely all ruled by members of Attila's dynasty. These groups often fought each other, however, and Kim argues that this allowed the [Avars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Avars "Pannonian Avars") to conquer them and "recreat\[e\] the old Hunnic Empire in its entirety".[^footnotekim2013142-198] He argues that Avars themselves had Hunnic, but not European Hunnic, elements prior to their invasion.[^footnotekim2015139-199]

The tribe of [Sabirs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabirs "Sabirs") is sometimes identified in Byzantine sources as Huns, and Denis Sinor argues that they may have contained some Hunnic elements as well.[^footnotesinor1990200-200] Kim, however, identifies them with the [Xianbei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei "Xianbei").[^footnotekim2015132-184]

A final possible survival of the Huns are the [North Caucasian Huns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Caucasian_Huns "North Caucasian Huns"), who lived in what is now [Dagestan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan "Dagestan").[^footnotekim2015137-201] It is unclear whether these Huns were ever under Attila's rule.[^footnotegolden199291-202] Kim argues that they are a group of Huns who were separated from the main confederation by the intruding Sabirs.[^footnotekim2015136-192] In 503 they raided Persia, and they are recorded raiding [Armenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia "Armenia"), [Cappadocia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia "Cappadocia"), and [Lycaonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaonia "Lycaonia") in 515.[^footnotekim2015135%e2%80%93136-203] The Romans hired mercenaries from this group, including a king named [Askoum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascum "Ascum").[^footnotekim2015136-192] At some point, the North Caucasian Huns became a vassal state of the [Khazar Khaganate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Khaganate "Khazar Khaganate").[^footnotesinor1990201-204] They are recorded to have converted to Christianity in 681.[^footnotegolden1992107-205] The North Caucasian Huns are last attested in the seventh century,[^footnotegolden1992108-206] but Kim argues that they may have persisted within the Khazar empire.[^footnotekim2015137-201]

Peter Golden argues that the Huns, and the migrations that are associated with them, resulted in the transformation of the Western Eurasian steppe from the territory of primarily Iranian-speaking nomads to Turkic-speaking ones, as Turkic speakers moved west from modern Mongolia.[^footnotegolden199286%e2%80%9387-207]

Within Europe, the Huns are typically held responsible for the beginning of the [Migration period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_period "Migration period"), in which mostly Germanic tribes increasingly moved into the space of the late Roman Empire.[^footnotesinor1990177-208][^footnoteheather199516-209] Peter Heather has argued that Huns were thereby responsible for the eventual disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, [^footnoteheather199519,_37%e2%80%9341-210] while E. A. Thompson argued that the Huns accelerated Germanic incursions both before and after their own presence on the Roman frontier.[^footnotethompson1996236%e2%80%93237-211] Walter Pohl, meanwhile notes that "\[w\]hat the Huns had achieved was a massive transfer of resources from the Roman empire to the *barbaricum*".[^footnotepohl1999502-212] Due to his differing opinions on the organization of the Huns, Hyun Jin Kim argues that, rather than by causing migrations of Germanic peoples, the Huns were responsible for the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the force of their armies and their efficient imperial administration, leading to a collapse of the Roman military.[^footnotekim201369%e2%80%9388-213]

Other scholars have seen the Huns as less important in the end of Rome. J. Otto Maenchen-Helfen described the Huns under Attila as "for a few years more than a nuisance to the Romans, though at no time a real danger".[^footnotemaenchen-helfen1973125%e2%80%93126-214] Other scholars such as J. B. Bury have in fact argued that the Huns held the Germanic tribes back and thus gave the empire a few more years of life.[^footnotethompson1996235%e2%80%93236-215]
