RFC 3339 is a standard for defining a format for dates and times in a
machine-readable format. The format is based on [[ISO 8601]] and is commonly used
in APIs, logs, and other data exchanges.

**The basic format** of RFC 3339 is:

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ

• YYYY is the four-digit year
• MM is the two-digit month (01-12)
• DD is the two-digit day of the month (01-31)
• T is a separator between the date and time
• hh is the two-digit hour of the day (00-23)
• mm is the two-digit minute (00-59)
• ss is the two-digit second (00-59)
• Z is a timezone indicator. It can be either a "Z" character, which
represents UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), or an offset from UTC in the
format ±hh:mm (e.g., -06:00 for 6 hours behind UTC).

An example of a date and time in RFC 3339 format is:

2022-12-15T13:30:00-05:00

This represents the date of December 15, 2022, at 1:30 PM Eastern Standard
Time (GMT-5).

It is possible to omit fields when they are known or not relevant. For
example, if the timezone is UTC, it can be represented with a Z instead of
the offset.

2022-12-15T13:30:00Z

This represents the same date and time as the previous example but in UTC.

It is also possible to omit the time portion of the format and represent
only the date.

2022-12-15

This represents the date of December 15, 2022, with no time or timezone
information.

RFC 3339 allows for other optional fields, such as the fractional seconds,
but they are less commonly used. For more details, you can check the RFC
3339 document.
