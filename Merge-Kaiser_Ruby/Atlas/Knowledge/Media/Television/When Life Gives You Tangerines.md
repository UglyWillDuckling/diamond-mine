***When Life Gives You Tangerines*** ([Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 폭싹 속았수다; [Jeju](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language "Jeju language") for 'Thank You for Your Hard Work' [^1]) is a 2025 South Korean [romance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_drama "Romance drama") [slice-of-life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice-of-life "Slice-of-life") [television series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_drama "Korean drama") written by [Lim Sang-choon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lim_Sang-choon "Lim Sang-choon"), directed by [Kim Won-seok](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Won-seok "Kim Won-seok"),

___

A domestic and international hit, the series received widespread praise for its performances, screenplay, and direction.

The original Korean title, *Pokssak sogatsuda* ([Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 폭싹 속았수다), was revealed on January 27, 2023. The title is a [Jeju language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language "Jeju language") verb for "thank you for your hard work".[^52] In Jeju language, *sokda* ([Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 속다), which forms a part of *sogatsuda* ([Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 속았수다), means "trying hard", "taking the trouble" or "having a hard time".[^61] Coincidentally, *sokda* is a linguistic [false friend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend "False friend") to the standard Korean word for "be deceived", "be cheated" or "be fooled", so *Pokssak sogatsuda* could be misinterpreted as the standard Korean translation for "heavily fooled".[^61]

The English title, *When Life Gives You [Tangerines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine "Tangerine")*, was announced on January 30, 2023,[^62] and is a word play on the [proverb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb "Proverb") " [When life gives you lemons, make lemonade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_life_gives_you_lemons,_make_lemonade "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade") ";[^63] the fruit that grows in Jeju Island is [mandarin orange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_orange "Mandarin orange"), however. The Chinese title, *Kǔjìngānlái Yùjiànnǐ* ([Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 苦盡柑來遇見你; lit.

On the [review aggregator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), 100% of 6 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.5/10.[^74] [^75] The series was a domestic and international hit.[^76] It received plaudits for its performances, screenplay, and direction,[^77] [^78] and has been favorably compared to the acclaimed period drama *[Reply 1988](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_1988 "Reply 1988")* (2015–16), also starring [Park Bo-gum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Bo-gum "Park Bo-gum"), for eliciting nostalgia and warmth rooted in the Korean experience.[^79] [^80] [^81]

[*Time* magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_magazine "Time magazine") praised the series for being "devastatingly profound", showing not only "the story of one family" but also "the story of Korea's modernization from the postwar period to today" and highlighting "a rich and distinct cultural history" of Jeju island.[^82] *[India Today](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today "India Today")* stated that the series "isn't just a love story, nor is it merely a historical drama. It's a meditation on time, on love, and on the quiet labor of care that stretches across lifetimes." *[^83]* Per *[South China Morning Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Morning_Post "South China Morning Post")* the series "masterfully bridged past and present, blurring the line between nostalgic reverie and pressing reality" calling it "one of the very best [K-dramas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_drama "Korean drama") of all time – and quite possibly the most Korean of them all." [^84] The series was also praised by the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") -owned daily tabloid *[Global Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times "Global Times"),* which raised the issue of [illegal streaming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_piracy "Online piracy") since Netflix is not available in China.[^85]

The series was in Netflix's Top 10 Non-English Shows for nine weeks.

Leads [IU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IU_\(singer\) "IU (singer)") and [Park Bo-gum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Bo-gum "Park Bo-gum") at the series official press conference, 5 March 2025

According to the mobile big data platform Mobile Index, [Netflix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") reported 14 million [monthly active users](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monthly_active_users "Monthly active users") (MAUs) in March 2025, reflecting an increase of over 640,000 from the previous month. This marked the first time Netflix's MAUs exceeded 14 million since January 2023, when the drama *[The Glory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glory_\(TV_series\) "The Glory (TV series)")* gained significant popularity. Following the initial public release of the series, [Pan Entertainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Entertainment "Pan Entertainment") 's stock price rose by 22.12%. Ahead of the second release, the stock reached 3,930 won, surpassing its 52-week high.[^95]

Netflix Korea generated additional revenue through [intellectual property](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") collaborations aimed at drama enthusiasts. A partnership with Yuhan-Kimberly resulted in the launch of a limited edition 'Kleenex Moisturizing Essence Lotion', with packaging featuring the drama; this product sold out during the pre-order phase.[^95] [^96] Collaboration with design studio Oimu produced stationery items, including notebooks, letter paper, and [rapeseed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed "Rapeseed") bookmarks, which quickly sold out at the Inventario stationery fair.[^95] [^97] Official merchandise including [keychains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain "Keychain") and [plushies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_toy "Stuffed toy") of Ae-sun and Gwan-sik, was also released.[^98] The platform also partnered with a life insurance company to feature quotes in the series as the company's advertising material.[^99]

Following its release in the first week of March, the series topped the Good Data Corporation's *[^2]* Top 10 TV-OTT Drama Topicality Ranking for seven consecutive weeks. During this period, [IU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IU_\(entertainer\) "IU (entertainer)") ranked first in the buzz-worthy drama performer category. [Park Bo-gum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Bo-gum "Park Bo-gum") ranked second for six consecutive weeks and third the following week. In the third week of March, [Lee Jun-young](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jun-young "Lee Jun-young") was fourth, and [Kim Seon-ho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Seon-ho "Kim Seon-ho") was tenth. In the fourth week, Kim Seon-ho ranked third, Lee Jun-young eighth, and [Kang You-seok](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_You-seok "Kang You-seok") tenth.[^101] The series also secured the top spot in [Gallup Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_Korea "Gallup Korea") 's nationwide survey of favorite TV programs for March, April, and May 2025. It is Netflix’s fifth series to rank first for three consecutive months. It is also the first drama to surpass a 10% preference rating since January 2013.[^102]

The show had a major influence on popular culture, resulting in the creation of the term "Pokssak Sogatsuda Craze" (폭싹 속았수다 열풍). It's impact went beyond the series, shaping trends in furniture, fashion, food, and tourism.[^103] [^104] The mother-of-pearl chest treasured by Ae-sun in the drama prompted a trend of refurbishing similar chests, with many sharing their work on social media. Cafes and boutique hotels incorporating mother-of-pearl chest in neighborhoods like Seongsu-dong and Ikseon-dong have gained popularity among [Generation Z](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z "Generation Z").[^105] The fashion styles of Ae-sun and Gwan-sik in the drama led to a resurgence of Retro chic, also known as [Grandmacore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmacore "Grandmacore"). Online shopping sites reported a spike in searches for these styles after the drama's release, with retro items like pearl hairpins, dot scarves, checkered ties, and floral shirts experiencing a notable increase in sales.[^106] [^107] A school lunch menu with dishes inspired by the series, such as [barley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley "Barley") and [pea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea "Pea") rice, [squid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid "Squid"), and [croaker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croaker_fish "Croaker fish"), gained popularity on social media.[^108] These dishes subsequently appeared in various cafeterias, including [Hybe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybe_Corporation "Hybe Corporation") 's cafeteria, further increasing online interest.[^109] Sales of [sesame oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_oil "Sesame oil"), [perilla oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilla_oil "Perilla oil"), [soju](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju "Soju") brand, fried chicken brand, and snacks from the show have also experienced a significant boost.[^110] [^111]

The [Jeju Tourism Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Tourism_Organization "Jeju Tourism Organization") has observed a surge in interest in Jeju, the main setting of the series, prompting airlines to increase flights to Jeju for Golden Week.[^106] Major airlines like [Korean Air](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air "Korean Air"), [Asiana Airlines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiana_Airlines "Asiana Airlines"), and [Jeju Air](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Air "Jeju Air") reported that all flights to Jeju during the May Golden Week (May 1-6) were fully booked. Many routes to and from Jeju closed early before the holiday, and some remaining seats were sold at more than double the usual price.[^112] In addition, after the success of the series, Jeju's local government and Netflix Korea signed the "Business Agreement for Activation of Jeju Culture and Tourism and Content" on May 16, 2025.[^113]

[Park Bo-gum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Bo-gum "Park Bo-gum") 's portrayal of Gwan-sik was popular domestically and internationally,[^114] and "sparked a cultural craze" [^115] The character, also portrayed by Park Hae-joon in middle-age, was the subject of a [meme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme "Meme") called "My Own Gwan-sik" where users posted about their partners, husbands, and fathers behaving like the drama's main lead.[^116] Also popular on social media were [Choi Dae-hoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Dae-hoon "Choi Dae-hoon") 's character, nicknamed "Mr. Hak-ssi",[^117] and [Kim Seon-ho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Seon-ho "Kim Seon-ho") 's character with users sharing their attempts to mimic his actions from the drama.[^118] [^119]

The series' recognition led to unauthorized use of its images. A supermarket in [Hebei, China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei "Hebei") used images of the main characters from the drama in advertisements without permission, including scenes of Park Bo-gum as Gwan-sik selling cabbages and IU as Ae-sun holding a cup of pea rice.[^120] On June 2, 2025, shortly before [2025 South Korean presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_South_Korean_presidential_election "2025 South Korean presidential election"), candidate [Kim Moon-soo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Moon-soo_\(politician\) "Kim Moon-soo (politician)") posted a parody of the series on his social media replacing the faces of IU and Park Bo-gum with his and his wife’s. Prior to this, he wore a red jumpsuit similar to Gwan-sik’s costume while campaigning in Jeju. Some viewers questioned whether Netflix had authorized the use and expressed concerns about politicizing the show. On June 3, Netflix stated that it was aware of the parody but had not approved it and was monitoring for further unauthorized uses.[^121] [^122]
