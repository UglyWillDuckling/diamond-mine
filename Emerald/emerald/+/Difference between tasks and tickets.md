Although not quite defined we may view as the difference between something that is [[ephemeral]], the task, and something more permanent, the [[ticket]].

Often, tasks can be considered **temporary** and can even be deleted soon after they are completed.
Example: send images to Natasa, or test this thing here.

Tickets represent something that we would like to preserve, at least in part, and we definitely want to be able to go back to them after some time, usually when we are working on a related ticket. This way, a web  of (invisible) connections is made between tickets and removing just one of the tickets can break the whole chain.
Tickets in general have an [[identity]] associated with with them.

**Is this always the case**?

No, some tickets are [[ephemeral]] and can be deleted, even then the cost of keeping them is really small.
For tasks on the other hand, the only thing that we want to preserve is time, usually the start and, most importantly, the end date.

**Anything else important about tasks?**

Yes, we should focus here more on the products(artifacts) of tasks, rather  than tasks themeselves. When I'm done with a task I don't really care about it anymore, **but**, I do care what was actually **done** or **created**.Robert A. Heinlein

%% This is simliar to setttings goals, the task has a goal and once that is achieved I'm mostly interested in that thing %%

Two categories come to mind here: **actions** and **artificats**

*actions*
 anything that was done that made changes to something important. These can be deployments, document updates, sent message, even commits.

*artifacts*
 Things that were made. Could be tools, scripts, documents...

ðŸ“”there is an obvious **overlap** between the 2 groups. 
~~Updating is an especially tricky topic, is a change of a document an `artifact`(e.g. a paragraph) or is it just an `action`. ?~~
I don't think anymore that there is an overlap between the two. The change creates the new **version** of the document. *If* we wish to keep the old one we need a [[VCS]][^1].

### What about tickets

**Tickets** are different in  the sense that we regard them by themselves as something of content and value. They contain, usually, information that is relevant and combine with other tickets to form a **network** of information that is useful in the long run [^2].
This doesn't mean that they don't produce anything, they do, same as *tasks* and often much more, but they also haver inherent qualities that make them valuable.
**Connections** between tickets are crucial.

products of tickets: [[artifact]], changes(new versions of existing stuff)

#### other 


**Similiaries between the two**

Both have a **temporal** quality to them so timing information and their position on a timescale is important.
They both produce and create value outside of them.
