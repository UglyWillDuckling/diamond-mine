#subticket 

- depends on both the project status and `filled` schedule

- ? maybe this could be done on the Backend and included in the `response` object
	- we would just a field `should_show_schedule`

___

- [ ] update bff response to include the value
- [ ] verify response with multiple projects
- [ ] update FE logic to use the new field
	- [ ] render the schedule conditionally
	- [ ] remove obsolete code
