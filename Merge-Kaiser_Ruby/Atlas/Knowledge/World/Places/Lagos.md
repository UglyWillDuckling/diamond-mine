Probably 25 now</span>21 million </span>dwellers, it is the largest city in Nigeria, and the most populous urban area on the African continent.[^15][^16][^17][^18] [^19] Lagos was the national capital of [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria") until the [government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nigeria "Government of Nigeria")'s December 1991 decision to move their capital to [Abuja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja "Abuja") in the centre of the country.[^20][^21][^22] Lagos is a major African [financial centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_center "Financial center") and is the economic hub of [Lagos State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State "Lagos State") and [[Nigeria]] at large. The city has a significant influence on [commerce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce "Commerce"), [entertainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment "Entertainment"), [technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), [education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"), [politics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics"), [tourism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism "Tourism"), [art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art"), and [fashion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion "Fashion") in [Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"). Lagos is also among the top ten of the world's fastest-growing cities and [urban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area "Urban area") areas.[^30][^31] In 2024, [Time Out magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_\(magazine\) "Time Out (magazine)") ranked Lagos as the 19th Best City to visit in the World. A [megacity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity "Megacity"), it has the fourth-highest [GDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product") in Africa,[^metropolitan_lagos-2][^32] and houses one of the [largest and busiest seaports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apapa "Apapa") on the continent.[^33][^34][^global-35] Due to the large urban population and port traffic volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity and the most fast rising city.[^36]

Lagos emerged as a home to the [Awori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awori_tribe "Awori tribe") subgroup of the [Yoruba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people "Yoruba people") of [West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa") islands in the 15th century, which are contained in the present-day Local Government Areas ([LGAs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lagos_State_local_government_areas_by_population "List of Lagos State local government areas by population")) of [Lagos Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Island "Lagos Island"), [Eti-Osa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eti-Osa "Eti-Osa"), [Amuwo-Odofin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuwo-Odofin "Amuwo-Odofin") and [Apapa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apapa "Apapa"). Before 15th century, the Awori settled on a Farmstead along the coastal line in which they worked and lived in and around their Farmstead which translates to eko which formed the Lagos indigenous name “Eko”. The lands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of [Lagos Lagoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Lagoon "Lagos Lagoon"), while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by [barrier islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island "Barrier island") and long sand spits such as [Bar Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Beach,_Lagos "Bar Beach, Lagos"), which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanisation, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day [Lagos Mainland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Mainland "Lagos Mainland"), [Ajeromi-Ifelodun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajeromi-Ifelodun "Ajeromi-Ifelodun"), and [Surulere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surulere "Surulere"). This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the [Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Island), which was the original city of Lagos, and the [Mainland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Mainland), which it has since expanded into.[^lagos_case_study-37] This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present-day seven [Local Government Areas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lagos_State_local_government_areas_by_population "List of Lagos State local government areas by population") (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then [Western Region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Region,_Nigeria "Western Region, Nigeria") to form the state.[^lagos_state_information-38]

However, the state capital was later moved to [Ikeja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikeja "Ikeja") in 1976,[^39] and the federal capital moved to [Abuja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja "Abuja") in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present-day Lagos, also known as "Metropolitan Lagos", and officially as "Lagos Metropolitan Area"[^40][^41][^42] is an [urban agglomeration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_agglomeration "Urban agglomeration") or [conurbation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conurbation "Conurbation"),[^43] consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State.[^metropolitan_lagos-2][^44] This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.[^metropolitan_lagos-2][^lagos_state_information-38][^45]

The population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed.[^46] In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 9 million people.[^metropolitan_lagos_population-47] However, the figure was disputed by the [Lagos State Government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State_Government "Lagos State Government"), which later released its own population data, putting the population of [Lagos Metropolitan Area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Metropolitan_Area_Transport_Authority "Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority") at approximately 16 million.[^lga-3] Daily, the Lagos area is growing by some 3,000 people or around 1.1 million annually, so the true population figure of the greater Lagos area in 2022 is roughly 28 million (up from some 23.5 million in 2018). Lagos may therefore have overtaken [Kinshasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinshasa "Kinshasa") as Africa's most populous city. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of "Greater Metropolitan Lagos", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into [Ogun State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogun_State "Ogun State"), at approximately 21 million.[^metrolagospop-1][^lagos_state_information-38][^48][^the_sustainable_city-49] The Lagos conurbation is part of an emerging transnational [megalopolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalopolis "Megalopolis") on the coast of West Africa that includes areas in five [sovereign states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state"), the [Abidjan–Lagos Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan%E2%80%93Lagos_Corridor "Abidjan–Lagos Corridor").[^50][^51]

The [University of Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lagos "University of Lagos") is one of the [first generation universities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Nigeria#First_generation_universities "Education in Nigeria") of Nigeria. The business district of Lagos is home to [Tinubu Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinubu_Square "Tinubu Square"), named after the aristocratic slave trader [Efunroye Tinubu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efunroye_Tinubu "Efunroye Tinubu"). Lagos contains [Murtala Muhammed International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtala_Muhammed_International_Airport "Murtala Muhammed International Airport"), named after [Murtala Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtala_Muhammad "Murtala Muhammad"), one of the former Nigerian presidents; the airport is one of the busiest African airports. [Lagos National Stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stadium,_Lagos "National Stadium, Lagos") has hosted various international sports events such as the [1980 African Cup of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_African_Cup_of_Nations "1980 African Cup of Nations").

*Lagos* is derived from the Portuguese word for "lakes". The pronunciation ([*LAY\-goss*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is typically standard in [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") and [Nigerian English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_English "Nigerian English").[^wells-14][^hd-52] Speakers of [American English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English") often use the pronunciation ([*LAH\-gohss*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")), which sounds more similar to the original Portuguese pronunciation.[^wells-14][^hd-52] The native [Yoruba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language "Yoruba language") name *Èkó* is also used by [Yoruba people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people "Yoruba people"). Lagos may have been named after [Lagos, Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos,_Portugal "Lagos, Portugal"), as it was the main centre of Portuguese maritime expeditions down the African coast in the 15th century.[^53]

Satellite image of Lagos

Lagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas—the "Island" and the "Mainland".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The city of Lagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and Shitta Bey Mosque.[^72][^73][^74] Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings.[^75] In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.[^76][^77][^78][^79][^80]

The Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the "Mainland" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks and are connected by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events take place, as well as where most of the upscale residential areas are concentrated. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be on the Island include [Lagos Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Island "Lagos Island") and [Eti-Osa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eti-Osa "Eti-Osa"). The major upscale Island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include [Ikoyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikoyi "Ikoyi") and [Victoria Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Island_\(Nigeria\) "Victoria Island (Nigeria)"). Three major bridges join the Island to the Mainland. They are the [Carter Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Bridge "Carter Bridge"), which starts from Iddo; the [Eko Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eko_Bridge "Eko Bridge") (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the [Third Mainland Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Mainland_Bridge "Third Mainland Bridge"), which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon. The Ikoyi link bridge links Ikoyi and Lekki Phase 1, both of which are part of the Island.[^81]

Construction on the [Fourth Mainland Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Mainland_Bridge "Fourth Mainland Bridge") will commence in 2022, according to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.[^82][^83]

 Lagos Marina

Lagos Island contains a [central business district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district "Central business district").[^84] This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The Island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular [Idumota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idumota_Market "Idumota Market") and [Balogun Markets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balogun_Market "Balogun Market")).[^85] It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, [Christ's Church Cathedral (CMS)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_Church_of_Christ,_Lagos "Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos") and the [Oba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oba_of_Lagos "Oba of Lagos")'s Palace ([Iga Idunganran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_Idunganran "Iga Idunganran")).[^86] Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's [Tinubu Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinubu_Square "Tinubu Square") is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South [protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate "Protectorate") to form Nigeria took place in 1914.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

 Aerial view of Ikoyi

[Ikoyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikoyi "Ikoyi") is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a [landfill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill "Landfill").[^88][^89] Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek.[^90] Falomo garden, a green public space which was developed by the state government in conjunction with Fidelity Bank in 2017, is located under the bridge.[^91] Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.[^92]

In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison, and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has [hotels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel "Hotel"), [nightclubs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub "Nightclub"), a recreational park, and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a [middle class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class "Middle class") neighbourhood, in recent years it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the [upper middle class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_middle_class "Upper middle class") to the [upper class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class "Upper class"). The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

[Eko Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eko_Atlantic "Eko Atlantic"), a project at the mouth of [Lagos Lagoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Lagoon "Lagos Lagoon") under construction, extending and further developing Victoria Island (imaged from [Tarkwa Bay Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkwa_Bay_Beach "Tarkwa Bay Beach"))

Victoria Island with its annex is situated to the south of Lagos Island and known with a zip code of 101241[^93] as assigned by NIPOST.[^conference-94] It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments. Along with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts several shopping districts. On its seashore along the Atlantic front there is an environmentally reconstructed [Bar Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Beach,_Lagos "Bar Beach, Lagos").[^95]

**Ajah/Lekki**

The Lekki Peninsula shares some prestige with its Ikoyi and Victoria Island neighbours. Development has stretched the piece of land further such that the Ibeju axis, though closer to Epe (which is on the outskirts of Lagos) is almost always described as part of Lekki. The expanse of land starts from the Lekki toll gate, which was the focal stage of the famous #EndSars protest in October 2020, and ends in Ibeju-Lekki and boasts of communities slowly inching their way to suburb status such as [Ajah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajah,_Lagos "Ajah, Lagos"), Awoyaya, Sangotedo, Abijo, and Eputu. There is quite a bit of place to see – the [Lekki Conservation Centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki_Conservation_Centre "Lekki Conservation Centre"); The Novare Mall; The [Lekki Free Trade Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki_Free_Trade_Zone "Lekki Free Trade Zone") – Dangote, Africa's richest man is building his refinery in this FTZ; [Lagos Business School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Business_School "Lagos Business School"); [Eleko Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleko_Beach "Eleko Beach"); [Elegushi Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegushi_Beach "Elegushi Beach"); La Camaigne Tropicana – a beach/tourist getaway, [Pan-Atlantic University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Atlantic_University "Pan-Atlantic University"). The area has a Catholic monastery.[^96]

Across the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called [Iddo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iddo_Island "Iddo Island"). Iddo is also [a railroad terminus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Terminus_railway_station "Lagos Terminus railway station") and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland Local Government Area after it was connected to the Mainland like a peninsula.[^97]

A huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos Mainland, and most industries are located there. The Mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around [Yaba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaba,_Lagos "Yaba, Lagos"), Ikeja, and [Surulere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surulere "Surulere"). However, in recent years more nightclubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate, and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attraction. Mainland LGAs include [Surulere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surulere "Surulere"), [Apapa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apapa "Apapa"), and [Lagos Mainland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Mainland "Lagos Mainland"). Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [Agege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agege "Agege"), [Amuwo Odofin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuwo_Odofin "Amuwo Odofin"), [Mushin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin,_Lagos "Mushin, Lagos"), [Oshodi-Isolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshodi-Isolo "Oshodi-Isolo") and Ikeja (site of [Murtala Muhammed International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtala_Muhammed_International_Airport "Murtala Muhammed International Airport") and the capital of Lagos State).[^98]

Major areas on the Mainland include [Ebute Metta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebute_Metta "Ebute Metta"), [Yaba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaba,_Lagos "Yaba, Lagos") and [Ejigbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejigbo,_Lagos "Ejigbo, Lagos"). Some rivers, like [Badagry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badagry "Badagry") Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Lagos experiences a [tropical savanna climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_savanna_climate "Tropical savanna climate") (*Aw*) according to the [Köppen climate classification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"), as there are three months under 60 mm or 2.4 in of rain, and annual rainfall is not nearly high enough for [tropical monsoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_monsoon_climate "Tropical monsoon climate") classification. The wet season starts in March and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in February. The wettest month is June with precipitation total 316 mm or 12.44 in, while the driest month is January with precipitation total 13 mm or 0.51 in.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

A 2019 paper published in [PLOS One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_One "PLOS One") estimated that under [Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#4.5 "Representative Concentration Pathway"), a "moderate" scenario of [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Lagos in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [Panama City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_City "Panama City"). The annual temperature would increase by 1.6 °C (2.9 °F) and the temperature of the warmest month by 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), while the temperature of the coldest month would be 2.9 °C (5.2 °F) higher.[^104][^105] According to [Climate Action Tracker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Action_Tracker "Climate Action Tracker"), the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.[^106]

Moreover, according to the 2022 [IPCC Sixth Assessment Report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Sixth_Assessment_Report "IPCC Sixth Assessment Report"), Lagos is one of 12 major African cities ([Abidjan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan "Abidjan"), [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), [Algiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers "Algiers"), [Cape Town](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town "Cape Town"), [Casablanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca"), [Dakar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar "Dakar"), [Dar es Salaam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam "Dar es Salaam"), [Durban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban "Durban"), Lagos, [Lomé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lom%C3%A9 "Lomé"), [Luanda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luanda "Luanda") and [Maputo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo "Maputo")) that would be the most severely affected by [sea level rise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise"). It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damage of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion in the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [marine ice sheet instability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ice_sheet_instability "Marine ice sheet instability") at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damage, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.[^107] Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.[^108] Sea level rise is being exacerbated by [subsidence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence "Subsidence"), which is occurring at up to 87 millimetres (3.4 in) per year.[^109]

Lagos is a cultural centre of Nigeria. As a [port city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port "Port") and the starting point of [British colonisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), the Western influence is stronger here than in probably any other Nigerian city. All Nigerian ethnic groups can be found in the [melting pot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot "Melting pot") of this [metropolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis "Metropolis"), with the [Yoruba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people "Yoruba people") predominating. The [music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Nigeria "Music of Nigeria") and [film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Nigeria "Cinema of Nigeria") industries in the city are dynamic centres of the country with international acclaim.

The [Cathedral Church of Christ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_Church_of_Christ,_Lagos "Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos") at the central Marina on Lagos Island

A very striking building in Lagos is the National Arts Theatre with its oval base. The renovation of the National Arts Theatre was completed in March 2023.[^177] With the new "blue line" of the [Lagos light rail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Rail_Mass_Transit "Lagos Rail Mass Transit"), the National Theatre is recently easily accessible – the station "National theatre" is at a stone's throw distance from the theatre building.

Another frequently photographed structure in Lagos is the [Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki-Ikoyi_Link_Bridge "Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge") – or more simply: Lekki bridge.

The [Cathedral Church of Christ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_Church_of_Christ,_Lagos "Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos") is at the centre of the oldest part of Lagos. The Anglican church was built between 1867 and 1869, shortly after the establishment of British colonial rule.

The [Synagogue Church of All Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue_Church_of_All_Nations "Synagogue Church of All Nations") was built in 2004.

 [Silverbird Galleria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverbird_Galleria "Silverbird Galleria") cinema in Lagos

The Surulere district is the centre of the Nigerian film industry, commonly referred to as Nollywood. Lagos itself is the location and setting for many films. The city is featured in domestic and foreign feature film productions. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos, which also hosted the World Festival of Black Arts.[^nollywood-211] The 2016 film *[Captain America: Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War "Captain America: Civil War")* contains a scene set in Lagos.[^212] The Spanish police series *La unidad* (2020–2023), the British drama *The last tree* (2019) and the US-Spanish drama *The Way, Chapter 2* with [Martin Sheen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen "Martin Sheen") (2023 still in development) also use Lagos as a filming location. The film *[93 Days](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_Days "93 Days")* with [Danny Glover](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Glover "Danny Glover") is a somewhat melodramatic but fact-based account of the [Ebola outbreak in Lagos in 2014](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_in_Nigeria "Ebola in Nigeria") and was filmed at original locations.

Since the success of the Nigerian thriller *The Figurine*, Nigerian film has increasingly focused on high-quality productions that are also commercially successful. This, in turn, has led to ever-new records in box office takings in Nigeria (2009: "The Figurine", 2013: "Half of a Yellow Sun", 2016: "The Wedding Party").[^213] .
