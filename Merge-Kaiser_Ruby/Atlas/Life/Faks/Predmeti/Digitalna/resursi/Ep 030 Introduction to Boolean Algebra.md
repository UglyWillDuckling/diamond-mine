This video shows how different Boolean algebraic expressions might operate the same, and hence, serves as an introduction to the manipulation and simplification of logic expressions.  
  
Takeaways: At the completion of this lesson, each student should be able to:  
• use truth tables to prove that two Boolean algebraic expressions are equivalent and  
• explain why one circuit would be an improvement over the other with respect to speed, power, cost, or board space.
