## basic definition
The characteristic or ability of something, usually a system, to hide as much of its inner workings(structure and behavior) as it can, while showing only what is needed for it to be able to collaborate with other systems and/or actors.

Encapsulation/Information hiding naturally lead to abstraction as the only parts of a system that are visible are the ones that are important to their collaborators and the world at large. This is the same as the basic workings of abstraction which necessitates hiding(excluding) all irrelevant details and thus results in the important parts getting amplified.

We may even view encapsulation as the same [[abstraction]] process **but** going in the opposite direction, instead of choosing the relevant information and discarding the rest we **hide** everything that we can and the important parts `float to the surface` so to speak.
