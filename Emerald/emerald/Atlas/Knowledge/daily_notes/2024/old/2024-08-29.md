Onwards we go brave travelers of the Netherworld...

What new adventures await, what fowl beasts lurk in the shadows beyond?

## yesterday

I spent allot of time reading [[Object Design Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations]] book by [[Rebecca Wirfs-Brock]].
I might continue with that today, but in a reduced fashion.
This also included code examples and some experimentation of my own. I find this to be very useful.

I also did a little bit of work on react, mostly just thinking 🧠 about it. [[react study|react study]]
