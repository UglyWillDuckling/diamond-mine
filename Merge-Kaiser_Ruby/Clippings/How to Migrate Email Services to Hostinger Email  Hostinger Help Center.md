How to Migrate Email Services to Hostinger Email

Migrating your email services to Hostinger Email

Migrate your email service to Hostinger by following the steps below ðŸ‘‡

## Step 1 â€“ Create Email Accounts With Hostinger Email

It's recommended to **use the same names for email accounts**, so your audience wouldn't even notice that you've migrated. Although, it's possible to import emails to a different account, e.g., from `support@domain.tld` to `contact@business.tld`.

## Step 2 â€“ Recreate Previous Configurations

All of these are bound to the email provider you currently use, so recreating them at Hostinger is a must if you wish these to continue working properly.

## Step 3 â€“ Add the Required Hostinger Email DNS Records

Make sure that **only Hostinger Email records** are present there, and delete any other MX, SPF, and DKIM records:

Having only one set of records at a time is needed to avoid possible conflicts and lost emails.

## Step 4 â€“ Wait for DNS Propagation to Complete

Any changes in a domain's DNS zone trigger **[propagation](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/4146975-what-is-dns-propagation)**, which can require **up to 24 hours** to complete. To check if DNS propagation is over, head to **[DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/)**, enter your domain name, select the DNS record type, and make sure that âœ… is shown on every location:

## Step 5 â€“ Migrate Email Messages

Once the above steps are completed, you can start migrating your emails. There are several ways to do that:

## Step 6 â€“ Set Up Devices and Email Clients

The last step is reconfiguring any devices, email clients, or email plugins that you use:
