  "I.e." is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase "id est," which means "that
  is" or "in other words." It's often used to provide a clarification or
  explanation of something.

  In English, "i.e." is used to indicate that what follows is a rephrasing or

  specify the types of books being referred to.)
  • "The new policy applies to all employees, i.e., full-time, part-time, and

  • "The company specializes in IT solutions, i.e., software development and

  • "The company offers a range of services, i.e., consulting, training, and
