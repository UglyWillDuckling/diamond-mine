**coverage** table `definition`:
 ![[biz_product_coverage table creation def]]
## notes üìî

- [[Vicents insights into Transac]]
- This `city_id` is only used as a **filter**. It takes all irises for **one** city from the `geo` table  
	 and performs an insert into `coverage`
- The [[backyard]] is just a way to `trigger` an update of  certain **cities(irises)**
- & **Place** **id** **is** **the id** from the [[geo_place2 table]] table
	- it functions as a `foreign key` [^1]
- the `iris_id` is the same in the new table as is the `id` field in the [[geo_place2 table]] table
- [[iris_id]] is **city_id** and **that** is `place_id`
- place_id in coverage **is** `iris_id`

- product_id : **4 types** in [[biz_product_coverage table]]
- in the table: only `promising_seller_contract_offer` are relevant
	- filter by **key**
	- others are very old

- [[process to update zones iris automatically]]
- [[manual process to update irises]]
- from [[Alan Jaouen]]:  `yes my staging is connected to your dev env`

## Work notes üóí

- moving things out of fat controllers feels really good
	- more readable
	- easier to update
	- easier to understand
	- diffs[^2] are easier to follow
	- allows everything to be located in  one place
	- makes code reusable
	%%note: I could write more on this one %%

- [x] check current status of items in table ``
- [x] **update** items on `dev`
- [x] check the logic, write down everything important ‚úç
- [x] play around with the code, move stuff around ü§æ‚Äç‚ôÇ
- [x] try to add an update of the [[biz_product_coverage table]] tables
- [x] refactor the code[^3] 
- [x] test the `refactors`
- [x] add [[#update coverage table]]

## `update` the coverage table

We need to update the coverage table during the updates and both automatic and manual updates need to be accounted for.

- [x] check for existing duplicates in the coverage table: filter by `place_id`
- [x] **try out** how adding the models/rows would work in practice üî® ü™ö
	- [x] create new model and save
	- [x] **delete** model
- [x] write down the exact logic of [[biz_product_coverage table]] updates ‚úç
- [x] `implement` the **actual** table updates
	- [x] automatic from salesforce
	- [x] **manual**
- [x] compare code with current implementation
	- [x] returns
	- [ ] logic
	- [ ] error handling
	- [ ] `logging`

### **Logic**:
This is all for the [[biz_product_coverage table]]
[[mediaAPI example req]]

mediaapi/models/product.py : `ProductCoverage`
`__tablename__ = "biz_product_coverage"`
