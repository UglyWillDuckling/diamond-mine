This article is about the 2024 Atlantic hurricane. For other storms of the same name, see [List of storms named Helene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_storms_named_Helene "List of storms named Helene").

**Hurricane Helene** ( [*heh-LEEN*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"))[^1] was a devastating [tropical cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") that caused widespread catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the [Southeastern United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States "Southeastern United States") in late September 2024. It was the strongest hurricane on record to strike the [Big Bend region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_\(Florida\) "Big Bend (Florida)") of [Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"), the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since [Maria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria "Hurricane Maria") in [2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season "2017 Atlantic hurricane season"), and the deadliest to strike the [mainland U.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_United_States "Continental United States") since [Katrina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") in [2005](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season "2005 Atlantic hurricane season").[^helene180-2][^ycc-3]

The eighth [named storm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_naming "Tropical cyclone naming"), fifth [hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane "Atlantic hurricane"), and second [major hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Categories "Saffir–Simpson scale") of the [2024 Atlantic hurricane season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Atlantic_hurricane_season "2024 Atlantic hurricane season"), Helene began forming on September 22 as a broad low-pressure system in the western [Caribbean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea "Caribbean Sea").[^beginning-4] By September 24, the disturbance had consolidated enough to become a tropical storm as it approached the [Yucatán Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula "Yucatán Peninsula"), receiving the name *Helene* from the [National Hurricane Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center "National Hurricane Center"). Weather conditions led to the cyclone's intensification, and it became a hurricane early on September 25. More pronounced and [rapid intensification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification "Rapid intensification") ensued as Helene traversed the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") the following day, reaching Category 4 intensity on the evening of September 26. Late on September 26, Helene made [landfall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall "Landfall") at peak intensity in the Big Bend region of Florida, near the city of [Perry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry,_Florida "Perry, Florida"), with [maximum sustained winds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind "Maximum sustained wind") of 140 mph (220 km/h). Helene weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating to a [post-tropical cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-tropical_cyclone "Post-tropical cyclone") over [Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee "Tennessee") on September 27. The storm then stalled over the state before dissipating on September 29.

In advance of Helene's landfall, [states of emergency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency "State of emergency") were declared in [Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida") and [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(U.S._state\) "Georgia (U.S. state)") due to the significant impacts expected, including very high [storm surge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge "Storm surge") along the coast and hurricane-force gusts as far inland as [Atlanta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"). [Hurricane warnings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches") also extended further inland due to Helene's fast motion. The storm caused catastrophic rainfall-triggered [flooding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding "Flooding"), particularly in [western North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_North_Carolina "Western North Carolina"), [East Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Tennessee "East Tennessee"), and [southwestern Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Virginia "Southwest Virginia"), and spawned numerous [tornadoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"). Helene also inundated [Tampa Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay "Tampa Bay"), breaking [storm surge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge "Storm surge") records throughout the area. As of January 7, 2025, at least 219 deaths and $78.7 billion in damage have been attributed to the storm.[^5]

On September 17, the [National Hurricane Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center "National Hurricane Center") (NHC) highlighted the potential for [tropical cyclogenesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis "Tropical cyclogenesis") in the western Caribbean Sea.[^6] Conditions conducive for development of a tropical cyclone resulted from the interaction of the [Central American gyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_gyre "Central American gyre")—a broad monsoon low pressure system—and the [Madden–Julian Oscillation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden%E2%80%93Julian_Oscillation "Madden–Julian Oscillation"), which reinforced the large-scale cyclonic flow extending from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the western Caribbean Sea.[^7] Several days later, on September 22, a broad low-pressure area developed within the western Caribbean.[^beginning-4] As the system traversed an environment conducive for tropical cyclone development,[^8] showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance gradually consolidated.[^9] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated [Potential Tropical Cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tropical_cyclone_terms#P "Glossary of tropical cyclone terms") *Nine* on September 23.[^10] The next day, [Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/53rd_Weather_Reconnaissance_Squadron "53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron") aircraft found that the system was producing flight-level winds of 52 mph (84 km/h) and had developed a better-defined center; the NHC accordingly upgraded the system to Tropical Storm *Helene* at 15:00 UTC. The system continued strengthening, with [NOAA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration") and Air Force Reserve [Hurricane Hunters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters "Hurricane hunters") finding that Helene's maximum winds had increased to 80 mph (130 km/h). As a result, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on September 25, as it entered the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") while turning north. An [upper-level trough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_\(meteorology\) "Trough (meteorology)") to its west and a ridge of [high pressure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_area "High-pressure area") located off the Southeastern United States both served to steer the cyclone towards the [U.S. Gulf Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Gulf_Coast "U.S. Gulf Coast").[^12] Helene was a very large system,[^13] with the NHC noting in multiple forecast discussions that the forecast storm radii were "at the 90th percentile of hurricane size at similar latitudes".

After remaining steady in intensity for a while due to its broad size and some [entrainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_\(meteorology\) "Entrainment (meteorology)") of drier air to its west, Helene recovered quickly and began its [rapid intensification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification "Rapid intensification") early on the morning of September 26 – aided by low mid-level [wind shear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear "Wind shear"), high [relative humidity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity#Relative_humidity "Humidity") values and [sea surface temperatures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature "Sea surface temperature") (SSTs) exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) near the [Loop Current](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_Current "Loop Current") — as an increasingly defined [eye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_\(cyclone\) "Eye (cyclone)") developed, reaching Category 2 intensity at 12:00 UTC.[^14] Quickly strengthening, by 18:25 UTC Helene was found to have become a [major hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Categories "Saffir–Simpson scale") by Hurricane Hunters,[^15] and four hours later, a Category 4 hurricane.[^16] The hurricane attained its peak intensity later that night with [maximum sustained wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind "Maximum sustained wind") of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 938 millibars (27.70 inHg) at 3:10 UTC on September 27 as it made landfall east of the center of the [Aucilla River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aucilla_River "Aucilla River") about 10 miles (16 km) west-southwest of [Perry, Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry,_Florida "Perry, Florida"),[^17] becoming the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's [Big Bend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_\(Florida\) "Big Bend (Florida)") region.[^weather_channel_storm's_inland_trek-18] Rapid weakening occurred as the storm tracked inland, and by the time it reached Georgia at 05:00 UTC the next day, it had weakened into a Category 2 hurricane.[^19] Weakening further, it became a tropical storm over east central Georgia a few hours later.[^20] After a few hours, it weakened and became a tropical depression near the Kentucky-Tennessee border, northeast of [Cookeville, Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookeville,_Tennessee "Cookeville, Tennessee").[^21] It rapidly became a [post-tropical cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-tropical_cyclone "Post-tropical cyclone") and eventually dissipated on September 29.

On October 9, researchers with [World Weather Attribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Weather_Attribution "World Weather Attribution") concluded with "high confidence" that Helene was made worse by [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"). In a scientific assessment, researchers found that Helene had 10% more rain, had winds that were 13 miles per hour more intense, and drew energy from water that was 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer due to climate change.[^22]<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="Relative to what? (October 2024)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This "13 miles per hour" means that the wind speed increased by 11% and as the destruction from hurricanes grew by 50% when the wind speed increased by 5%, [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") increased the destruction from the hurricane by more than twice. Researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that in some parts of Georgia and North Carolina climate change increased the rainfall from the storm by more than 50%.[^23]
