The **Harmattan** is a [season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") in [West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa") that occurs between the end of November and the middle of March. It is characterized by the dry and dusty northeasterly [trade wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_wind "Trade wind"), of the same name, which blows from the [Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara") over West Africa into the [Gulf of Guinea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea "Gulf of Guinea").[^bharmattan-1] The name is related to the word *haramata* in the [Twi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twi "Twi") language.[^2] The temperature is cold mostly at night in some places but can be very hot in certain places during daytime. Generally, temperature differences can also depend on local circumstances.[^3]

The Harmattan blows during the dry season, which occurs during the months with the lowest sun. In this season, the [subtropical ridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_ridge "Subtropical ridge") of [high pressure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_pressure "High pressure") stays over the central Sahara and the low-pressure [Intertropical Convergence Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone "Intertropical Convergence Zone") (ITCZ) stays over the Gulf of Guinea. On its passage over the Sahara, the Harmattan picks fine dust and sand particles (between 0.5 and 10 microns). It is also known as the "doctor wind", because of its invigorating dryness compared with humid tropical air.

This season differs from [winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter "Winter") because it is characterized by cold, dry,[^dove_press-4] dust-laden wind, and also wide fluctuations in the [ambient temperatures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature#Ambient_versus_room_temperature "Room temperature") of the day and night. Temperatures can easily be as low as 9 °C (48 °F) all day, but sometimes in the afternoon the temperature can also soar to as high as 35 °C (95 °F), while the [relative humidity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity") drops under 5%. It can also be hot in some regions, like in the Sahara.[^5]

The air is particularly dry and desiccating when the Harmattan blows over the region.[^dove_press-4] The Harmattan brings desert-like weather conditions: it lowers the humidity, dissipates cloud cover, prevents rainfall formation and sometimes creates big clouds of dust which can result in [dust storms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm "Dust storm") or [sandstorms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstorms "Sandstorms").<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The wind can increase fire risk[^6] and cause severe crop damage.[^saharan_wind_stirs_cocoa_market-7] The interaction of the Harmattan with [monsoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon") winds can cause [tornadoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado").[^bharmattan-1]

In some countries in West Africa, the heavy amount of dust in the air can severely limit visibility and block the sun for several days,[^8] comparable to a heavy [fog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog"). This effect is known as the Harmattan haze. It costs airlines millions of dollars in cancelled and diverted flights each year.[^9][^re-10] When the haze is weak, the skies are clear.[^11] The extreme dryness of the air may cause branches of trees to die.[^12]

A 2024 study found that dust carried by the Harmattan increases infant and child mortality, as well as has persistent adverse health impacts on surviving children.[^13]

Humidity can drop lower than 15%, which can result in spontaneous nosebleeds for some people.[^saharan_wind_stirs_cocoa_market-7] Other health effects on humans may include conditions of the skin (dryness of the skin), dried or chapped lips, eyes, and respiratory system, including aggravation of [asthma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma "Asthma").[^14]
