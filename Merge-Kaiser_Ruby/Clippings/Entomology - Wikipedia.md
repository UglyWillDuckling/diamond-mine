**Entomology** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") ἔντομον (*éntomon*), meaning "insect", and [\-logy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy "-logy") from λόγος (*lógos*), meaning "study") [^1] is the branch of [zoology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology "Zoology") that focuses on insects. Those who study entomology are known as entomologists. In the past, the term *insect* was less specific, and historically the definition of entomology would also include the study of [animals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal") in other [arthropod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod "Arthropod") groups, such as [arachnids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid "Arachnid"), [myriapods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriapod "Myriapod"), and [crustaceans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustaceans "Crustaceans"). The field is also referred to as insectology in American English, while in British English insectology implies the study of the relationships between insects and humans.[^2]

Over 1.3million insect [species](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") have been described by entomology.[^3]

Plate from *Transactions of the Entomological Society*, 1848

These 100 *[Trigonopterus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonopterus "Trigonopterus")* species were described simultaneously using [DNA barcoding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_barcoding "DNA barcoding").

Entomology is rooted in nearly all human [cultures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture") from [prehistoric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric "Prehistoric") times, primarily in the context of [agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") (especially [biological control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_control "Biological control") and [beekeeping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping "Beekeeping")). The natural Roman philosopher [Pliny the Elder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") (23–79 CE) wrote a book on the kinds of insects,[^4] while the scientist [of Kufa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammarians_of_Kufa "Grammarians of Kufa"), [Ibn al-A'rābī](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-A%27r%C4%81b%C4%AB "Ibn al-A'rābī") (760–845 CE) wrote a book on flies, *Kitāb al-Dabāb* (كتاب الذباب). However scientific study in the modern sense began only relatively recently, in the 16th century.[^5] [Ulisse Aldrovandi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulisse_Aldrovandi "Ulisse Aldrovandi") 's *De Animalibus Insectis* (Concerning Insect Animals) was published in 1602. Microscopist [Jan Swammerdam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Swammerdam "Jan Swammerdam") published *History of Insects*, correctly describing the reproductive organs of insects and [metamorphosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis_\(biology\) "Metamorphosis (biology)").[^6] In 1705, [Maria Sibylla Merian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sibylla_Merian "Maria Sibylla Merian") published the book *Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium* about the tropical insects of [Dutch Surinam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surinam_\(Dutch_colony\) "Surinam (Dutch colony)").[^7]

Early entomological works associated with the naming and classification of species followed the practice of maintaining [cabinets of curiosity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities "Cabinet of curiosities"), predominantly in Europe. This collecting fashion led to the formation of natural history societies, exhibitions of private collections, and journals for recording communications and the documentation of new species. Many of the collectors tended to be from the aristocracy, and there developed a trade involving collectors around the world and traders. This has been called the "era of heroic entomology". [William Kirby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kirby_\(entomologist\) "William Kirby (entomologist)") is widely considered as the father of entomology in England. In collaboration with [William Spence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Spence_\(entomologist\) "William Spence (entomologist)"), he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, *Introduction to Entomology*, regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped found the [Royal Entomological Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Entomological_Society "Royal Entomological Society") in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the [Aurelian society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian_\(entomology\) "Aurelian (entomology)") date back to the 1740s. In the late 19th century, the growth of agriculture, and colonial trade spawned the "era of economic entomology" which created the professional entomologist associated with the rise of the university and training in the field of biology.[^8] [^9]

Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as [Charles Darwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin"), [Jean-Henri Fabre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Henri_Fabre "Jean-Henri Fabre"), [Vladimir Nabokov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov "Vladimir Nabokov"), [Karl von Frisch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Frisch "Karl von Frisch") (winner of the 1973 [Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine "Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine")),[^10] and twice [Pulitzer Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize "Pulitzer Prize") winner [E. O. Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson "E. O. Wilson").

There has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance,[^11] such as [Sophie Lutterlough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Lutterlough "Sophie Lutterlough") at the Smithsonian [National Museum of Natural History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History "National Museum of Natural History"). Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with [butterflies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") [^12] and (to a lesser extent) [dragonflies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") being the most popular.[^13]

Most insects can easily be allocated to [order](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_\(biology\) "Order (biology)"), such as [Hymenoptera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera "Hymenoptera") (bees, wasps, and ants) or [Coleoptera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleoptera "Coleoptera") (beetles). However, identifying to genus or species is usually only possible through the use of [identification keys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_key "Identification key") and [monographs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph "Monograph"). Because the class [Insecta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecta "Insecta") contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 species of beetles alone) and the characteristics distinguishing them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a microscope), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of [automated species identification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_species_identification "Automated species identification") systems targeted on insects, for example, [Daisy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Automated_Identification_SYstem_\(DAISY\) "Digital Automated Identification SYstem (DAISY)"), ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing.

In 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new [professional certification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification "Professional certification") program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a "true entomologist" an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing a PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs or Associate Certified Entomologists.[^14]

As such, other credential programs managed by the Entomological Society of America have varying credential requirements. These different programs are known as Public Health Entomology (PHE), Certified IPM Technicians (CITs), and Board Certified Entomologists (BCEs) (ESA Certification Corporation). To be qualified in public health entomology (PHE), one must pass an exam on the types of arthropods that can spread diseases and lead to medical complications (ESA Certification Corporation). These individuals also have to "agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior" (ESA Certification Corporation). Individuals who are planning to become Certified IPM Technicians (CITs), need to obtain at around 1–4 years of experience in pest management and successfully pass an exam, that is based on the information, that they are acquainted with (ESA Certification Corporation). Like in Public Health Entomology (PHE), those who want to become Certified IPM Technicians (CITs) also have to "agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior" (ESA Certification Corporation). These individuals must also be approved to use pesticides (ESA Certification Corporation). For those who plan on becoming Board Certified Entomologists (BCEs), individuals have to pass two exams and "agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior" (ESA Certification Corporation). As with this, they also have to fulfill a certain amount of educational requirements every 12 months (ESA Certification Corporation).[^15]

[Forensic entomology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_entomology "Forensic entomology") is a branch of [forensic science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science "Forensic science") that studies insects found on corpses or elsewhere around crime scenes. This includes studying the types of insects commonly found on [cadavers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver "Cadaver"), their life cycles, their presence in different environments, and how insect assemblages change with [decomposition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition "Decomposition").[^16]

[Medical entomology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_entomology "Medical entomology") is focused upon [insects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect "Insect") and [arthropods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod "Arthropod") that impact human health. Veterinary entomology is included in this category, because many animal diseases can "jump species" and become a human health threat, for example, bovine encephalitis. Medical entomology also includes scientific research on the behavior, ecology, and [epidemiology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology") of arthropod disease [vectors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_\(epidemiology\) "Vector (epidemiology)"), and involves a tremendous outreach to the public, including local and state officials and other stake holders in the interest of public safety.
