Today, you are called upon to play a vital role in the future of our universe. Your heart burns with a fire which darkness cannot quench. For you are pure of heart whose destiny is to fight evil. But before you engage in battle, you must learn of Uma's history and thus come to understand why the threat of darkness still hangs over the people of the planet.  
  
Thousands of years ago a titanic struggle between Life and Death took place and mankind was on the brink of destruction. The goddess Kaliba called upon the Druids who lived in the great forests of Uma to help in this battle. She gave unto them the gift of the Time Orb, which was fashioned from the tears that fell from her cheeks. With the power of the Time Orb behind them the Druids were able to bring this war to an end. After the wars, the Druids that survived the battle against Death decided to break up the Time Orb to prevent it from being used for evil purposes. And so it was divided into Seven Crystals and entrusted to anonymous guardians throughout the land.  
  
A thousand years later one Kaliba's monks, Draak, tempted by the power of Death, left the monastery, and chose a path of darkness. Death soon found a powerful ally in Draak and gave him access to the secrets of necromancy he was able to resurrect a Dragon Lord and take over his body. Now wielding the powers of a dragon, he plans on devastating the world, by capturing its people to allows Death to feed on there souls. Kaliba's monks tried to talk sense to Draak, but were set asunder by the flames of his dragon breath.  
  
To regain balance of the land of Uma you must embark on a quest marked with death and destruction. Upon this trek you will learn skills and spells the will help you defeat Draak and his minions, thus bringing an end to his dark, demented dream of total annihilation.
