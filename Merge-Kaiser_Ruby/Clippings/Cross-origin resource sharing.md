**Cross-origin resource sharing** ( **CORS** ) is a mechanism to safely bypass the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy "Same-origin policy"), that is, it allows a web page to access restricted resources from a server on a domain different than the domain that served the web page.

A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_\(programming\) "Ajax (programming)") requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy. CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.[^1] It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.

The specification for CORS is included as part of the WHATWG's Fetch Living Standard.[^2] This specification describes how CORS is currently implemented in browsers.[^3] An earlier specification was published as a [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium "World Wide Web Consortium") Recommendation.[^4]

## Technical overview

![[~/Ã—/7b79531726388bf28463ab2aae44643b_MD5.png]]

Path of an [XMLHttpRequest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest "XMLHttpRequest") (XHR) through CORS.

For HTTP requests made from JavaScript that can't be made by using a <form> tag pointing to another domain or containing non-safelisted headers, the specification mandates that browsers "preflight" the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with an HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then, upon "approval" from the server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method. Servers can also notify clients whether "credentials" (including Cookies and HTTP Authentication data) should be sent with requests.[^5]

## Simple request example

Suppose a user visits http://www.example.com and the page attempts a cross-origin request to fetch data from http://service.example.com. A CORS-compatible browser will attempt to make a cross-origin request to service.example.com as follows.

1. The browser sends the GET request with an extra `Origin` [HTTP header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_header "HTTP header") to service.example.com containing the domain that served the parent page:
	```
	Origin: http://www.example.com
	```
2. The server at service.example.com sends one of these three responses:
	- The requested data along with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (ACAO) header in its response indicating the requests from the origin are allowed. For example in this case it should be:
		```
		Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com
		```
	- The requested data along with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (ACAO) header with a wildcard indicating that the requests from all domains are allowed:
		```
		Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
		```
	- An error page if the server does not allow a cross-origin request [^6]

A wildcard same-origin policy is appropriate when a page or API response is intended to be accessible to any code on any site. A freely available [web font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_font "Web font") on a public hosting service like [Google Fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fonts "Google Fonts") is an example.

The value of "\*" is special in that it does not allow requests to supply credentials, meaning that it does not allow HTTP authentication, client-side SSL certificates, or cookies to be sent in the cross-domain request.[^7]

Note that in the CORS architecture, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is being set by the external web service ( *service.example.com* ), not the original web application server ( *www.example.com* ). Here, *service.example.com* uses CORS to permit the browser to authorize *www.example.com* to make requests to *service.example.com*.

If a site specifies the header "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:true", third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information.

## Preflight example

When performing certain types of cross-domain Ajax requests, modern browsers that support CORS will initiate an extra "preflight" request to determine whether they have permission to perform the action. Cross-origin requests are preflighted this way because they may have implications to user data.

```
OPTIONS /
Host: service.example.com
Origin: http://www.example.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
```

If service.example.com is willing to accept the action, it may respond with the following headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT
```

The browser will then make the actual request. If service.example.com does not accept cross-site requests from this origin then it will respond with error to the OPTIONS request and the browser will not make the actual request.

## Headers

The HTTP headers that relate to CORS are:

### Request headers

- `Origin`
- `Access-Control-Request-Method`
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`

### Response headers

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
- `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
- `Access-Control-Max-Age`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`

## Browser support

CORS is supported by all browsers based on the following layout engines:

- [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_\(layout_engine\) "Blink (layout engine)") - and [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_\(web_browser\)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium "Chromium (web browser)") -based browsers ( [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome") 28+,[^8] [^9] [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_\(web_browser\) "Opera (web browser)") 15+,[^8] [Amazon Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Silk "Amazon Silk"), [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_\(operating_system\) "Android (operating system)") 's 4.4+ WebView and [Qt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_\(framework\) "Qt (framework)") WebEngine)
- [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_\(layout_engine\) "Gecko (layout engine)") 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,[^10] SeaMonkey 2.0 [^11] ) and above.
- [MSHTML/Trident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_\(layout_engine\) "Trident (layout engine)") 6.0 (Internet Explorer 10) has native support.[^12] MSHTML/Trident 4.0 & 5.0 (Internet Explorer 8 & 9) provide partial support via the XDomainRequest object.[^13]
- [Presto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_\(layout_engine\) "Presto (layout engine)") -based browsers (Opera) implement CORS as of [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_\(web_browser\) "Opera (web browser)") 12.00 [^14] and [Opera Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mobile "Opera Mobile") 12, but not [Opera Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mini "Opera Mini").[^15]
- [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit "WebKit") (Initial revision uncertain, Safari 4 and above,[^16] Google Chrome 3 and above, possibly earlier).[^17]
- [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge "Microsoft Edge") All versions.[^18]

## History

Cross-origin support was originally proposed by Matt Oshry, Brad Porter, and Michael Bodell of [Tellme Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellme_Networks "Tellme Networks") in March 2004 for inclusion in [VoiceXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML "VoiceXML") 2.1 [^19] to allow safe cross-origin data requests by VoiceXML browsers. The mechanism was deemed general in nature and not specific to VoiceXML and was subsequently separated into an implementation NOTE.[^20] The WebApps Working Group of the W3C with participation from the major browser vendors began to formalize the NOTE into a [W3C Working Draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Recommendation#Working_draft_\(WD\) "W3C Recommendation") on track toward formal [W3C Recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Recommendation#W3C_recommendation_\(REC\) "W3C Recommendation") status.

In May 2006 the first W3C Working Draft was submitted.[^21] In March 2009 the draft was renamed to "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" [^22] and in January 2014 it was accepted as a W3C Recommendation.[^23]

## CORS vs JSONP

CORS can be used as a modern alternative to the [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP "JSONP") pattern. The benefits of CORS are:

- While JSONP supports only the `GET` request method, CORS also supports other types of HTTP requests.
- CORS enables a web programmer to use regular [XMLHttpRequest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest "XMLHttpRequest"), which supports better error handling than JSONP.
- While JSONP can cause [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting "Cross-site scripting") issues when the external site is compromised, CORS allows websites to manually parse responses to increase security.[^1]

The main advantage of JSONP was its ability to work on legacy browsers which predate CORS support ( [Opera Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mini "Opera Mini") and [Internet Explorer 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9 "Internet Explorer 9") and earlier). CORS is now supported by most modern web browsers.[^24]
