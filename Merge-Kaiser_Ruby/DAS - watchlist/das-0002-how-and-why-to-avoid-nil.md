## `code`

```rb
class Person
  def subscribe
    Subscriber.new(Subscription.new)
  end
end

class Subscriber
  attr_reader :subsription

  def initialize(subsription)
    @subsription = subsription
  end
end

class Subscription
end

person = Person.new
if true
  subscriber = person.subscribe
  puts subscriber.subsription
end
```

# thoughts ðŸ—¯

- creating a new `Class` opens up **space** for new ideas
	- it also removes some possibility for error as the new class adds it's own conditions and boundaries and can only exist in certain scenarios
	- i.e. **there is no** subscriber without a valid subscription
- `nils` are much more ==obvious==
- the system is more **expressive** as we now have a new `domain concept`
	- the new concept can be used to think ðŸ¤” and communicate ðŸ›°
	- it also opens up new informational space within itself
		this new space is made even more useful by the fact it has a **boundary** around it which results in simplified logic
		- e.g. no need to check if a `subscription` exists, it **has to**

> **subscribers** have subscriptions, not every Person(people) does/do
