 You want a pretty "x" character!

  Here are a few options:

  1. × (Multiplication sign) - a stylish "x" with a more elegant feel
  2. ✗ (Cross mark) - a decorative "x" often used to indicate "no" or "cancel"
  3. ❌ (Cross) - another decorative "x" symbol with a more dramatic flair
  4. Ⓡ (Circled Latin capital letter X) - an "x" surrounded by a circle, often
  used in logos or branding
  1. ℵ (Script capital X) - a fancy, cursive-style "x" character

  Which one do you like best? 🤔
