At around the same time, Eccleston appeared in the *[Poirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie%27s_Poirot "Agatha Christie's Poirot")* episode "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe".

He was nominated again in 2004, losing to [Bill Nighy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nighy "Bill Nighy") who took the award for his performance in *[State of Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Play_\(TV_series\) "State of Play (TV series)")*.

In 2003, he won the Royal Television Society Best Actor award for his performance in *Flesh and Blood*.[^17]

On 2 April, 2004, the BBC revealed that Eccleston was to play the ninth incarnation of the Doctor in the revival of *Doctor Who*. Eccleston was the first actor born after the inception of the original series to play the role. It debuted on 26 March, 2005, and a few days later, on 30 March, the BBC released a statement, ostensibly from Eccleston, saying that he had decided to leave the role after just one series to avoid becoming [typecast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting "Typecasting"). On 4 April, the BBC revealed that the statement had been falsely attributed and released without Eccleston's consent. The broadcaster admitted that it had broken an agreement made in January not to disclose publicly that the actor had only intended to do one series. The statement had been issued following inquiries from journalists to the press office.[^18] Following his departure, Eccleston was replaced by [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant "David Tennant"), who played the [Tenth Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor "Tenth Doctor") from 2005 to 2010.[^19]

For his performance, Eccleston won a [National Television Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Television_Awards "National Television Awards") and was nominated for a [Broadcasting Press Guild Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_Press_Guild_Award "Broadcasting Press Guild Award") and [BAFTA Cymru Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Cymru "BAFTA Cymru")

On 11 June, 2005, when asked about his feelings about working on *Doctor Who*, Eccleston told a BBC interviewer: "Mixed, but that's a long story". Eccleston's reasons for leaving the role continued to be debated in Britain's newspapers: On 4 October, 2005 Alan Davies told *[The Daily Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")* that Eccleston had been "overworked" by the BBC and had left the role because he was "exhausted".[^20] Eccleston later stated that he had left the show because he "didn't enjoy the environment or the culture that the cast and crew had to work in", but that he was proud of having played the role.[^21] He subsequently said: "My relationship with my three immediate superiors – [the showrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies "Russell T Davies"), [the producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Gardner "Julie Gardner") and [co-producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collinson "Phil Collinson") – broke down irreparably during the first block of filming, and it never recovered." [^22] Eccleston said that *The Daily Telegraph* ' s quote was partially falsified, stating that he "didn't find \[the job\], physically, too tiring. When *The Telegraph* said that, any other producer reading that would go 'Oh, no, we can't employ Chris Eccleston because he gets tired.' So, it was a lie." [^23]

Eccleston was voted "Most Popular Actor" at the 2005 [National Television Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Television_Awards "National Television Awards") for his portrayal of the Doctor.[^24] In July 2012, Eccleston spoke positively of his time on *Doctor Who* during a talk at the National Theatre.[^25] This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the Doctor for the show's 50th anniversary special, " [The Day of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor "The Day of the Doctor") ", in 2013. [Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith "Matt Smith"), who portrayed the [Eleventh Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor "Eleventh Doctor"), stated that he would have loved Eccleston to return.[^26] After discussions with executive producer [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat "Steven Moffat"), Eccleston declined to return.[^27] In a 2018 interview Eccleston said that the BBC had "put \[him\] on a [blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting "Blacklisting") " when he left.[^28]

Eccleston began appearing as a guest at [*Doctor Who* conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_fandom#Conventions "Doctor Who fandom") for the first time in 2018.[^29] He had previously expressed his reluctance to appear at conventions, saying in 2017 that he preferred to "just earn \[his\] living by acting".[^30] He has since said that his experience of meeting fans at conventions "healed something in \[him\]" and made him re-evaluate his relationship to the series.[^31]

On 9 August, 2020, it was announced that Eccleston would reprise his role of the Ninth Doctor in audio dramas for [Big Finish Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Finish_Productions "Big Finish Productions"),[^32] across four boxsets to be released between May 2021 and February 2022. This would be the first time he had portrayed the role in 16 years.[^33] Eccleston was later confirmed to appear in a further four boxsets, releasing in 2022 and 2023,[^34] as well as an episode of the 60th anniversary audio series *[Once and Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_audio_plays_by_Big_Finish#Special_Releases_\(2001%E2%80%93present\) "List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish")*.[^35] He has said that it is unlikely that he will reprise the role on television as his relationship with the BBC "has not healed".[^23] When asked in 2023 what it would take for him to return to the character on television, Eccleston replied, "sack [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies "Russell T Davies"), sack [Jane Tranter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Tranter "Jane Tranter"), sack [Phil Collinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collinson "Phil Collinson"), sack [Julie Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Gardner "Julie Gardner") and I'll come back."
