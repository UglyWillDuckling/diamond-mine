Colony Wars is a Space Combat game similar to Freespace (more so than Wing Commander as there is no interactive story element) released by Psygnosis in 1997. The game does have branching missions were performing poorly will send you on a different path with a different ending. The game uses mixed resolutions so you may want to aspect correct to 16:9 so that the gameplay resembles TV Aspect.  
  
A little about the plot from Wiki:- "The Earth is fully stripped of natural resources by the fifth millennium. As a result, the Earth Empire sends out expeditionary sleeper ships to distant planets found to have abundant natural resources and harvest them. The discovery of hyperspace technology accelerates the Empire's interstellar expansion. As the colonies become more prosperous, the inhabitants begin to feel discontent over most of their mined resources being used for Earth's benefit. A peaceful insurrection in the 47th century only results in the Earth Empire's leader, the Tzar, personally leading the destruction of a rebellious planet. Stunned by the carnage, the other colonies band together as the League of Free Worlds, with a man known as the Father leading the fight.  
  
The Empire's Colonial Navy sends a fleet to attack League forces in the Gallonigher system, but the League executes hit-and-run strikes as they fall back to the main capital planet, Bennay. When the Navy overextends its forces for the assault on Bennay, the League lures them into a trap inside a nearby asteroid belt, where the Navy strike fleet is destroyed.  
  
The game picks up several months after what is now known as the Battle of Bennay, when the player character signs up for combat duty with the League as it fully mobilizes for war. If the player succeeds in Gallonigher, the League will proceed to the Draco system. If the player is defeated in Gallonigher, the League will survive, but will retreat to resupply bases in the Diomedes system before launching an attack on Alpha Centauri. It is also possible to be sent to Alpha Centauri by performing poorly during the Draco campaign."  
  
The path taken through the game leads to the games best ending however the other alternative endings are shown at the end of the video. The game shorter than expected mainly due to small/quick missions. if you ignore the fighters and just go for main target it can be over quickly. The weapon system can be annoying requiring you to switch to shield depleting before going in with full lasers otherwise it can take a while to kill the target. You will see quite often in the video I use less than optimal weapons while trying to stay alive Its a nice game on the PS1. the gameplay is pretty slick and the glowy weapon fire is visible on your ships hull as well as flying out into space and there are some nice explosions.  
  
00:00:00 - Intro and Gallonigher Missions  
00:30:40 - Entering Draco System  
01:04:10 - Entering the Sol System  
02:01:57 - The Final Assault (Followed by Ending 6)  
  
02:22:55 - Ending 1 - If the player loses any Act in the Diomedes system, the ending will see the Empire launch a fierce counterattack that crushes League forces in the system and chases them back to Gallonigher. The Tsar's personal flagship, the Super Titan-class dreadnought Tsunami, appears to destroy the League remnants.  
  
02:24:10 - Ending 2 - If defeated in Alpha Centauri, a group of League soldiers discontented with the war, called The Faction, win the upper hand against their former allies. The colonies are then enslaved and strip-mined by the Empire, who fully supported the Faction.  
  
02:25:27 - Ending 3 - If victorious in Alpha Centauri, the League and the Empire reach a tactical stalemate. With both sides realising that neither could ever truly destroy the other, they make peace after The Faction's destruction. The League gains independence, but agrees to support the Earth Empire and the preservation of the Sol system as tribute to its status as mankind's birthplace.  
  
02:26:42 - Ending 4 - If defeated in Sol, the League is forced to retreat, sealing the Sol warp hole behind them and effectively imprisoning the Earth Empire. Despite having a dark outcome, this ending sets up the plot for Colony Wars: Vengeance, a sequel set roughly 20 - 30 years later.  
  
Ending 5 and 6 is the ending shown as the games completion of this Longplay. Ending 6 is the same 5 with the addition of the unknown Alien ship leaving the planet and was shown for completing the game with no failed missions. -
