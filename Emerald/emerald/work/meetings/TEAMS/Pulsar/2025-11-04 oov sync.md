## to-do

1. **propagate** new fields
	- requires requirements update [Confluence API](https://avivgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AVIVIM/pages/1879351877/API+contracts+lambda+definitions) | [[Team Pulsar]], [[Team Phoenix]]
2. determine can we send automatic **email** to the **owner** once the visit is `accepted`? | [[Team Phoenix]]
3. test the connection in **production** | [[pulsar]]
