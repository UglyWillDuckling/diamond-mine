## recurring task setup

- [x] setup a **recurring** task every 2 weeks (bi-weekly), [[Morgen]] or [[Obsidian]]

We `should` have a reminder review every 2 weeks in addition to just having reminders. This will ensure that we have enough time ⏲ to process **all** reminders and that we don't
skip over some for the lack of time. If the task needs more time to complete we can always reschedule, move it or even cancel it.

Setup using [[obisidan tasks]]
