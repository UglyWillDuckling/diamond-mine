***She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*** is an American [animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_series "Animated series") superhero television series developed for [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") by [ND Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_Stevenson "ND Stevenson") and produced by [DreamWorks Animation Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation_Television "DreamWorks Animation Television"). Like the 1985 [Filmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmation "Filmation") series *[She-Ra: Princess of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra:_Princess_of_Power "She-Ra: Princess of Power")*, of which it is a [reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_\(fiction\) "Reboot (fiction)"), *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* tells the tale of Adora, an adolescent who can transform into the heroine She-Ra and leads a group of other magical [princesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess "Princess") in a rebellion against the evil Lord [Hordak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hordak "Hordak") and his Horde.

*She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its diverse cast and the complex relationship between [She-Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra "She-Ra") and her best friend-turned-archenemy [Catra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catra "Catra"). In 2019, the show was nominated for a [GLAAD Media Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award "GLAAD Media Award") for Outstanding Kids & Family Programming,[^2] as well as a [Daytime Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award "Daytime Emmy Award") at the [46th Daytime Emmy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46th_Daytime_Emmy_Awards "46th Daytime Emmy Awards"). In 2021, the series was tied with *[First Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Day_\(TV_series\) "First Day (TV series)")* when it won the [GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids and Family Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Award_for_Outstanding_Kids_and_Family_Programming "GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids and Family Programming").

The series ran on [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") from November 13, 2018 (2018-11-13), to May 15, 2020 (2020-05-15), having released 52 episodes over 5 seasons.[^3] On [linear TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_programming "Broadcast programming"), the show previously aired on [CBBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBBC "CBBC") in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), before it moved to [Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_\(British_and_Irish_TV_channel\) "Pop (British and Irish TV channel)") on January 30, 2023.[^4] It also aired on [Disney Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel "Disney Channel") and [DreamWorks Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Channel "DreamWorks Channel") across the globe.

## Synopsis

*She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* is set on the planet Etheria and follows the stories of [Adora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra "She-Ra") and [Catra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catra "Catra"), orphans who were raised to be soldiers in the Horde. They are part of an evil army led by [Hordak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hordak "Hordak"), a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the planet. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic [sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword "Sword") that transforms her into the legendary Princess of Power, [She-Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra "She-Ra"). After learning that the Horde is actually evil and has been inflicting suffering on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora decides to join the Rebellion in the fight against the Horde. She helps rebuild the Princess Alliance, a league of kingdoms ruled by other magical princesses. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Rebellion pits her against Catra, her former best friend, whose feelings of betrayal and abandonment twist her personal ambitions and lead her to become Adora's [archenemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archenemy "Archenemy"). Much of the show centers around their conflict.[^5]

In the first season, Adora helps reassemble the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault. Meanwhile, Catra rises in the ranks to become Hordak's second-in-command.

In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the interplanetary warlord Horde Prime. Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it.

In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend [Glimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glimmer_\(She-Ra\) "Glimmer (She-Ra)") (Angella's daughter and the new queen of Bright Moon) when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria. In order to prevent the weapon from activating, Adora destroys her sword, losing access to her She-Ra powers, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal, becoming vulnerable to attack by Horde Prime's armada.

The fifth and final season follows Adora's journey to liberate Etheria from Horde Prime's reign. Adora rescues a redeemed Catra and Glimmer from Horde Prime, discovering her innate She-Ra powers in the process, but in the meantime Horde Prime has subdued much of Etheria with his mind-control capabilities. The princesses and Catra work together to disable Horde Prime's hivemind and stop him from accessing Etheria's ancient superweapon. In the end, it is Adora and Catra's love for each other that enables She-Ra to destroy both the weapon and Horde Prime, and save the universe from his tyrannical reign.

## Production

### Development

Development and production of the series began concurrently in April 2016. It was announced on December 12, 2017.[^8] [Showrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner") [ND Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_Stevenson "ND Stevenson") initially pitched it to Netflix on the assumption of creating only one season, but in November 2018, he explained that "we now have four arcs of 13 episodes done".[^9] *She-Ra* is created using [traditional animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation "Traditional animation"), with the exception of some [computer animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation "Computer animation") for "complicated machinery".[^10][^11] The animation is provided by South Korean studio NE4U.

### Themes

The first season of the [serialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_\(radio_and_television\) "Serial (radio and television)") *She-Ra* reboot focuses on establishing the characters and their relationships in order to set up future seasons, initially by way of a "[mission-of-the-week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain_of_the_week "Villain of the week")" plot to have the core cast of Adora and her close friends, Glimmer and Bow recruit princesses to their rebellion.[^12] While the core premise and characters of the original series were carried over, as well as many of its affectations (such as Adora's transformation catchphrase "For the honor of Grayskull!"),[^13] the reboot sets itself apart from the 1980s series by its almost entirely female cast. The characters were made to be deliberately diverse,[^14] both in regard to appearance as well as character traits. For instance, some characters range from good to "evil but understandable", "utterly amoral" or "full-blown hippie".[^15] [He-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He-Man "He-Man"), who in the original version was She-Ra's brother who "awakens her destiny", does not appear in the reboot, in order to set up She-Ra as a hero in her own right.[^16]

According to Stevenson, the show's thematic core is the relationships among its characters, which range from "wide-eyed love" to "heart-rending [jealousy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jealousy "Jealousy"), [crushes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_\(psychology\) "Crush (psychology)") and infatuations".[^17] Reviewers particularly highlighted the convincing portrayal of the [anti-hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-hero "Anti-hero") Catra and her complicated "[frenemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenemy "Frenemy")" relationship with Adora,[^15][^18] which *[The Verge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge "The Verge")* described as "the best animated antihero story since *[Avatar: The Last Airbender's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender "Avatar: The Last Airbender")* [Zuko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuko "Zuko")".[^19] In addition, the series addresses such themes as abusive relationships and overcoming trauma,[^20] [prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice "Prejudice"), [isolationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism "Isolationism") (as exemplified, initially, by the princesses), [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization "Colonization"), [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), and [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide") (a result of Hordak's planetary-scale warfare).[^17] There is a strong focus on the struggle to break free of sociopolitical indoctrination, explored mainly through the stories of Adora, Hordak, and Light Hope. The series also emphasizes the necessity of taking action no matter one's own power or circumstances; it portrays magic as fallible and dependent on its wielder's skill and determination—Adora's powers in particular are directly tied to her love for her friends.[^21][^22][^23] Despite this, Adora's main internal conflict stems from being told she must suppress her personal desires in order to be the hero Etheria needs. Finally, Horde Prime's regime in Season 5 contains elements reminiscent of [fundamentalist Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Christianity "Fundamentalist Christianity"), which Stevenson has noted are not meant to be criticisms of religion itself but rather the kind of leadership seen in extremist, cult-like organizations.[^24]

In June 2020, Stevenson said that Catra was a [woman of color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_color "Woman of color"),[^25] saying he discussed her "being a brown Latina" when designing her, although this was not "explicitly, textually present in the show,"[^26] Stevenson also expressed enthusiasm for fans interpreting Catra as representing [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people "Persian people") ethnicity.[^27]

#### Influences

Stevenson cited *[Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe")* as a series that paved the way for *She-Ra*, saying his early conversations about queer relationships and characters in *She-Ra* were only possible because of *Steven Universe*.[^28] In another interview, he implied influence of *Steven Universe* on the show. He noted that the crew wanted to introduce [Catra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catra "Catra")'s pink lion Clawdeen, from the [original She-Ra series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra:_Princess_of_Power "She-Ra: Princess of Power"), into his series, but decided to not do so because its design was "pretty much identical" to *Steven Universe*'s [Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Steven_Universe_characters#Lion "List of Steven Universe characters").[^29] As a result, he chose Melog as a "[therapy animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-assisted_therapy "Animal-assisted therapy")" for Catra instead. Stevenson also noted the importance of featuring LGBTQ+ representation in kids animation, saying earlier shows made She-Ra's "range of queer representation" possible.[^30]

The show was also influenced by sci-fi in the 1970s and 1980s, paying homage to the original *She-Ra: Princess of Power* show,[^31] and *[Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons "Dungeons & Dragons")*. Stevenson called the show basically a D&D campaign, with Adora, Glimmer, and Bow falling into "specific classes in D&D."[^32] Additionally, Stevenson and the show's crew were strongly [influenced by anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime-influenced_animation "Anime-influenced animation"), especially those with [magical girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_girls "Magical girls").[^33]

#### LGBT representation

The creators indicated prior to release that the series would provide [LGBTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ "LGBTQ") representation.[^34] *[Tor.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor.com "Tor.com")* commented that the series "reads as utterly [queer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer "Queer") in just about every aspect", with many characters coded as fluid in terms of gender or sexuality, and none as clearly [heterosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual "Heterosexual").[^35] Stevenson said that when a network executive asked what the [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_\(LGBT_movement\) "Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)") in the climax of the first season's finale meant, he replied: "The [gay agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_agenda "Gay agenda")".[^36] In March 2021, Stevenson told *[Vanity Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\(magazine\) "Vanity Fair (magazine)")* that early in the show's run there "had to be plausible deniability" around most queer relationships, but this changed once he got "positive, vocal support from fans of the show" who picked up on queer subtext and wanted more. This enabled Stevenson to sell executives on the idea that the "queer relationship between the two leads \[was\] to be the climax of the entire show."[^37]

The relationship between Adora and Catra has [subtextual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtext "Subtext") undercurrents of romantic tension from the beginning of the series,[^15][^38][^39] and concludes with a mutual confession of love and an on-screen kiss in the very last episode. The scene has been regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of children's media and LGBT representation.[^40][^41] Other reviews praised the "queer romance" manifested by the Adora-Catra relationship[^42][^43][^44] and said that this slow-burn romance[^1] was a groundbreaking moment for TV.[^40][^45]

The series features same-sex attraction and romance among secondary and side characters as well. Two of the princesses, Spinerella and Netossa, are a [married](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage") couple,[^46][^47][^48][^43] and their relationship receives more attention in a plot arc in the fifth season when Netossa must rescue her wife from the villain's mind control.[^41][^49] An episode focusing on Bow, the male lead, explores his relationship with his [two fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting "LGBT parenting") Lance and George. Additionally, it is strongly implied that Scorpia, Catra's right-hand woman, has a crush on her and arranges pseudo-dates disguised as "side missions."[^50] Scorpia also mentions that the Horde soldier Kyle has a crush on his coworker, a humanoid lizard man named Rogelio, and ND Stevenson once tweeted that he envisions the two in a [polyamorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamorous "Polyamorous") relationship that involves their cohort Lonnie.[^51] Adora's mentor Light Hope is a female [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") who, while generally devoid of emotion, felt genuine affection for the woman Mara. In August 2020, Stevenson elaborated on Twitter that Light Hope's feelings were romantic.[^52]

In addition to same-sex romance, the show also includes [transgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") characters. The fourth season introduces a minor antagonist named Double Trouble, who is referred to with the [singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they "Singular they") pronoun. [Double Trouble's voice actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Tobia "Jacob Tobia") is also [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary "Non-binary").[^53][^54] Additionally, character designer Ray Geiger said on Tumblr that the character Jewelstar (who presented as female in the original series but presents as male in an episode of the remake) is a [transgender man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_man "Transgender man"), just like his voice actor, Alex Blue Davis. In the same post, Geiger also said that they designed Adora's friend Perfuma while envisioning her as a [trans woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman "Trans woman") but never told anyone for fear of [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship "Censorship").[^55][^56][^53]

In June 2021, Stevenson told [Insider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_\(website\) "Insider (website)") that while the show's staff had a "good number of trans and nonbinary crew," criticism from some of Double Trouble as a villain and a "nonbinary character whose gender nonconformity was conflated with...alienness," blindsided him, admitting he "might have done some things differently," had he known of this perspective.[^57] He also said this conversation was important because "it points to the limits of our imagination." Tobia also told the publication that non-binary representation on screen needs to reflect the diversity of the non-binary community and make a statement to viewers in the process.

### Staff and cast

[ND Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_Stevenson "ND Stevenson"), the creator of the rebooted *She-Ra*, with [Aimee Carrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimee_Carrero "Aimee Carrero"), voice of [She-Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra "She-Ra"), and [AJ Michalka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Michalka "AJ Michalka"), voice of [Catra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catra "Catra").

The series' showrunner and creator, [ND Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_Stevenson "ND Stevenson") (formerly known as Noelle Stevenson), is a cartoonist who became known for his [Eisner Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_Award "Eisner Award")\-winning comics *[Nimona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimona "Nimona")* and *[Lumberjanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumberjanes "Lumberjanes")*. The principal voice cast includes [Aimee Carrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimee_Carrero "Aimee Carrero") as She-Ra, [AJ Michalka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Michalka "AJ Michalka") as [Catra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catra "Catra"), [Karen Fukuhara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Fukuhara "Karen Fukuhara") as Glimmer, and [Marcus Scribner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Scribner "Marcus Scribner") as [Bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_\(Masters_of_the_Universe\) "Bow (Masters of the Universe)").[^58] [Mary Elizabeth McGlynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Elizabeth_McGlynn "Mary Elizabeth McGlynn") is the voice director.[^59] The series has an all-female writers' room, and only one man in the regular voice cast.[^17] Around 45 people worked on *She-Ra* in the [DreamWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation "DreamWorks Animation") offices in [Glendale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_California "Glendale, California").[^10]

### Design

Visually, the rebooted *She-Ra* series takes inspiration from [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime "Anime") and the works of [Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki "Hayao Miyazaki") and [Moebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud "Jean Giraud"). Whereas the original series' heroines were all of exactly the same size and shape to facilitate animation and toy production, and were all white (with the late exception of [Netossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netossa "Netossa")), the new series' characters are intentionally diverse in shape and ethnicity.[^17]

#### Character design

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/She-Ra_comparison.png/330px-She-Ra_comparison.png)

She-Ra in the 1985 series (left) and her 2018 redesign (right) that triggered debate on social media.

After first images of She-Ra's design were released in July 2018, controversy ensued on social media. Some Internet users contended that she was not as "beautiful and sexy",[^60] voluptuous or glamorous as in the original series,[^61] or that she looked like a boy.[^62] Other users responded that the new series tried to avoid sexualizing a children's show,[^63] and conveyed [body positivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_positivity "Body positivity").[^60]

[J. Michael Straczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski "J. Michael Straczynski"), the co-creator of the original series, commented that his She-Ra was written as "a warrior, first and foremost", and that "anyone who is looking back at \[her\] as the 'ideal woman' is doing so through the lens of prepubescent ... interest and kind of, understandably, imprinted on her like baby ducks. I get it. But that wasn't the creative intent."[^64] [Fan artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_art "Fan art"), mostly young women inspired by the new design's detractors to improve the new character's profile and her reputation, responded to She-Ra's redesign and the controversy over it with a wave of artworks celebrating the heroine's new look.[^61]

### Music

The series' title song is "Warriors" by Aaliyah Rose.[^65] The *[Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post "Washington Post")* highlighted it as one of the "theme song/opening credits so good it must not be skipped, right up there with *[Daredevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_\(TV_series\) "Daredevil (TV series)")*, *[The Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_\(TV_series\) "The Crown (TV series)")* and *[Narcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos "Narcos")*".[^13]

The soundtrack was composed by Sunna Wehrmeijer. She aimed at creating a "contemporary '80s synth-sound combined with orchestral adventure", based on the creators' desire to feature "big and epic" but also "sparkly" music.[^66] A soundtrack album was released to the public May 8, 2020 and included a cover of the theme song by AJ Michalka.[^67]

A first [teaser trailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaser_trailer "Teaser trailer") released in September 2018 showcased Adora's transformation into She-Ra.[^68] Longer trailers were released in October[^69] and November 2018.[^70] On January 24, 2019, the network announced the series' renewal for a second season, which debuted on April 26 of that year. A third season was released on August 2, 2019. The fourth season was released on November 5, 2019. The fifth and final season was released on May 15, 2020.[^71]

As a novelty for a television series, the series' website is available in a [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality") format, and is set up to present the user with a virtual crystal palace.[^72]

## Reception

### Critical response

While [Metacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic") has not assigned the series a [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_average "Weighted average") score, it has given all six reviews by mainstream critics a score of an 80 or above out of 100.[^73]

The first season received critical acclaim, with the review aggregator [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes") reporting [a 100% approval rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_with_a_100%25_rating_on_Rotten_Tomatoes "List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes") based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "By the grace of Greyskull, \[the first season of\] *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* packs a powerful visual punch that hits even harder thanks to layered writing and multidimensional characters – the perfect show for seasoned fans and little ones alike."[^74] Some stated that the series had a lot in common with shows such as *[Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender "Avatar: The Last Airbender")*, *[Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe")* and *[Sailor Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon_\(TV_series\) "Sailor Moon (TV series)")*, including characters who "read fluidly on the gender and sexuality spectrum."[^75] *[Vox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_\(website\) "Vox (website)")* called the series one of the "most LGBTQ-inclusive and diverse shows on television."[^76]

*[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")*'s Darren Franich described the series as "a funny-wonderful pop fantasy animated like disco fireworks, fun for kids of all genders and any parents looking for something happy to cry about". Franich appreciated the self-aware humor and "hiply transgressive newness". Franich also noted some repetition, occasionally flat animation and the final showdown's predictable outcome. He found some of the tension in contemporary American politics reflected in the series' portrayal of the rebuilding of a "coalition of powerful liberal-minded thinkers left in disarray after a brutal defeat years ago by a monstrously all-consuming bad dude".[^15] *[Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_\(website\) "Collider (website)")* called the series "visually exciting, emotionally charged, and unexpectedly hilarious", and "one of the best new shows of the year".[^77] David Griffin at IGN praised the series for successfully rebooting the franchise but concluded that "Adora could have used more time with the Horde to help develop her character".[^78]

*Hypable* praised the series' diversity and the multifaceted relationships among some of its core characters, but found much of the first season's plot "simplistic", and the rotating cast of princesses given short shrift.[^79] *[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")* highlighted the "top-notch" voice cast and particularly the work of [Lorraine Toussaint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Toussaint "Lorraine Toussaint") as the sorceress Shadow Weaver.[^13] *The Verge* commented that the series' biggest problem was that it was "retreading territory that *[Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe")* and the two *Avatar* [animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_\(franchise\)#Television_series "Avatar: The Last Airbender (franchise)") did better", with several characters and plot points heavily reminiscent of elements from these earlier animated series, and also criticized the early episodes' shallow plot.[^19] [Tor.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor.com "Tor.com")'s Maya Gittleman stated that the show not only "queers fantasy archetypes" but has a "deliberately inclusive, \[and\] diverse cast," works to highlight "different means of expressing power," and have room for "an expansive exploration of femininity." Gittleman further argued that the show operates further "outside the gender binary" than any show she knows of, that "Catradora has actually been canon for years" with the show focusing on a world where "the love of two queer girls gets to save the universe." In the end of her review, she says she would like to see more diverse "queer stories" in the years to come.[^14]

The second season has an 86% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "*She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* continues to go from strength to strength with ebullient flair in a second season that will enrapture younger fans while reminding adult viewers about the virtues of friendship and kindness."[^80]

The third season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10.[^81]

The fourth season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10.[^82]

The fifth and final season has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10.[^83] Raina Deerwater of [GLAAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD "GLAAD") stated that the center of the show is a "relationship between two women" (Adora and Catra), with the dynamic between them driving the entire series, comparing the show to *[Killing Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve "Killing Eve")* while noting shows like *[The Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra "The Legend of Korra")*, *[Adventure Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time "Adventure Time")*, and *[Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe")*.[^84] *[The Mary Sue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mary_Sue "The Mary Sue")* stated that the show's final season hammers home the message of love, compassion, and strength, even with an emphasis on forgiveness and allowing those who wish to be redeemed the space to change, like *[Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe")*.[^85] [Paper Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Magazine "Paper Magazine") argued that the show was carrying the torch from *Steven Universe* and said that the show tackles various topics like identity, responsibility, "importance of chosen family," and being queer itself.[^28] *[The A.V. Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club "The A.V. Club")* said that the sendoff of the series is satisfying, with Catra portrayed as a victim of trauma, with the message that nothing can overpower "the collective power of friendship, love, and solid storytelling."[^86] [PinkNews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PinkNews "PinkNews") called the final season "packed with big queer energy"[^87] while [Digital Spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Spy "Digital Spy") said that the kiss between Adora and Catra would change TV forever.[^40] Three reviewers for [Autostraddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostraddle "Autostraddle") called the final season a "literally perfect season of television."[^88] Tracy Brown of the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")* said that the show lets all kids, especially those who are queer, realize that "being honest about their feelings can make them a hero is as exciting as it is important."[^89] Emmet Asher-Perrin on *[Tor.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor.com "Tor.com")*, in their review, argued that Catra has an inferiority complex like [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_\(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe\) "Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)") in the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe "Marvel Cinematic Universe") films and the current incarnation of [The Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_\(Doctor_Who\) "The Master (Doctor Who)") in the *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who "Doctor Who")* series.[^90] A.H. Starlyng of the [LA Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Times "LA Times") said that the show's final season is the best in the show, including a [redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_\(theology\) "Redemption (theology)") arc for Catra, with Adora trying to help Catra become a better person.[^91]

### Legacy and influence

When talking with *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")* in May 2020, Stevenson said that he hoped that She-Ra would continue to pave the way, saying he hoped it will be easier to have "romances and relationships that are constant throughout the show" without it taking suspense out of the show itself.[^106] In a *[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times "New York Times")* profile on July 21, 2020, [climate activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_activist "Climate activist") [Jamie Margolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Margolin "Jamie Margolin") said she watched all five seasons of the show over a three-day period, telling the interview, "I was like, I hate the real world. I want to live on Etheria".[^107]

Scholars have approached the series with different perspectives. Paul Thomas argued the series is [monomythic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey "Hero's journey") and deploys this, while "queering normative understandings of heroic gender and sexuality," and providing an example for writers wanting to rehabilitate [Joseph Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell "Joseph Campbell")'s monomyth for the "increasingly queer, feminist, and intersectional world".[^108] Diana Burgos argued that the series, like *[The Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra "The Legend of Korra")* and *[Sailor Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon_\(TV_series\) "Sailor Moon (TV series)")*, provides a roadmap to audiences which are navigating through the "coded systems of gender and sexuality that poison their narratives." Burgos further stated that these three series urge audiences to claim their [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_\(philosophy\) "Agency (philosophy)") within "our collective unconscious and the liminal digital spaces of our social networks."[^109] Others noted that the series proved that [LGBTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ "LGBTQ") representation "does not have to be direct or in your face", and that the series is a manifestation of "queer seriality" in [streaming media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media").[^110][^111]
