The first Digimon World game was a virtual pet similar adventure game. Digimon World 2 was a turn based dungeon crawler, and the 4th game is a top down hack and slash. So with all that in mind, what kind of game do you think Digimon World 3 is?  
  
A charming traditional turn based JRPG? A greatest hit? A loving part of so many Digimon fanâ€™s childhoods? Or is it an incomplete game with a steep learning curve that is padded beyond belief? Or is it something else all together?
