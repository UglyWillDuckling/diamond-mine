[Context: Notes: project status progression flow]
[Timestamp: 2025/10/29 16:21:51]

**ai**: You're currently viewing a note titled "project status progression flow". This note appears to be a description of a canvas, likely a mind map or a flowchart, that outlines the progression of a project from start to finish.

The canvas contains various elements, including text nodes that represent different stages of the project, such as "OWNER", "OPPORTUNITY", "EVALUATION_REQUESTED", and so on. There are also links to other notes, including "Project status list".

The note also mentions a color scheme, with purple being used to represent "not sure" or possibly a specific stage in the project.

It seems like this note is a work in progress, with the author asking to describe the canvas in a more detailed and accurate way, using the actual titles/names of elements instead of their IDs, and paying attention to the content and relationships between elements.

Would you like me to help you with describing this canvas or summarizing its content?
