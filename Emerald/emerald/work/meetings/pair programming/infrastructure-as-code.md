## short

Infrastructure as code (`IaC`) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data center resources through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[1] The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a [[version control system]], rather than maintaining the code through manual processes. The code in the definition files may use either scripts or declarative definitions, but IaC more often employs [[declarative]] approaches.
