A calling campaing is an event that takes place over a specific period of time.

The campaign contains a list of leads that represent calls that will be made to them.

## ? questions

- [?] what is the **lifetime** of a [[lead]]
	- [?] when is the lead no longer in the campaign
	- [?] how long do they usually stay in the campaigns
	- [?] where do they go next?
- [?] is there a difference between the current campaign generation and what we need to do âœ…
	- `freezing` people? -> sending to [[SLMP]]
		- we should send **cold** leads to [[SLMP]]
	- more flexible: **start**, **end** dates; 
	- & planned for other countries
		- **rules** for countries

## lead scoring ðŸ’¯

Done by the [[B2c LeadRankingAPI]]

- ? do we need to do additional scoring
	- what would be the **rules**

## call/lead segmentation

The lead need to be put into specific segments and those segments should be used when creating a campaign.

**see** [[calling segment#segments list]]
