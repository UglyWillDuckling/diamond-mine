The **Eight-Nation Alliance** was a multinational military coalition that invaded northern [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") in 1900 during the [Boxer Rebellion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion "Boxer Rebellion"), with the stated aim of relieving the [foreign legations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Legation_Quarter "Peking Legation Quarter") in [Beijing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing"), which were being [besieged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_International_Legations "Siege of the International Legations") by the popular [Boxer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_movement "Boxer movement") militiamen, who were determined to remove foreign imperialism in China. The allied forces consisted of about 45,000 troops from the eight nations of [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"), [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan"), [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy"), and [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"). Neither the Chinese nor the quasi-concerted foreign allies issued a formal [declaration of war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlein20083-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>

No treaty or formal agreement bound the alliance together. Some Western historians define the first phase of hostilities, starting in August 1900, as "more or less a civil war",<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlein20083-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> though the [Battle of the Taku Forts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Taku_Forts_\(1900\) "Battle of the Taku Forts (1900)") in June pushed the [Qing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") government to support the Boxers. With the success of the invasion, the later stages developed into a punitive colonial expedition, which pillaged Beijing and [North China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China "North China") for more than a year. The fighting ended in 1901 with the signing of the [Boxer Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Protocol "Boxer Protocol").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-loot-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Boxers, a peasant movement, had attacked and killed foreign missionaries, nationals, and [Chinese Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Christians "Chinese Christians") across northern China in 1899 and 1900. The Qing government and its Imperial Army supported the Boxers and, under the [Manchu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people "Manchu people") general [Ronglu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronglu "Ronglu"), besieged foreign diplomats and civilians taking refuge in the [Legation Quarter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Legation_Quarter "Peking Legation Quarter") in Beijing (then romanized as Peking).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

The diplomatic compound was under siege by the Wuwei Rear Division of the Chinese Army and some Boxers (*Yihetuan*), for 55 days, from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge in the Legation Quarter.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Under the command of the British minister to China, [Claude Maxwell MacDonald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Maxwell_MacDonald "Claude Maxwell MacDonald"), the legation staff and security personnel defended the compound with small arms and one old cannon discovered and unearthed by Chinese Christians, who turned it over to the allies. It was nicknamed the *International Gun* because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian and the crew American.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

Also under siege in Beijing was the North Cathedral, the [Beitang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beitang_Church "Beitang Church") of the Catholic Church. The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 foreign Catholic priests and nuns, and about 3,200 [Chinese Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Catholics "Chinese Catholics"). The defenders suffered heavy casualties from lack of food and Chinese [mines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_warfare "Tunnel warfare") that exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>

On 14 August 1900, the allies marched to Beijing from [Tianjin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin "Tianjin") to relieve the Legation Quarter siege.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>

The allied troops invaded and occupied Beijing on 14 August 1900. They defeated the Qing Imperial Army's [Wuwei Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuwei_Corps "Wuwei Corps") in several engagements and quickly brought an end to the siege and also the Boxer Rebellion. [Empress Dowager Cixi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi "Empress Dowager Cixi"), the emperor and high government officials fled the [Imperial Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City "Forbidden City") for [Xi'an](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an "Xi'an") and sent [Li Hongzhang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang "Li Hongzhang") for peace talks with the alliance.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dillon2016-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

German and Japanese soldiers witnessing the street execution of a Chinese boxer

As allied troops moved from Beijing into the North China countryside, they executed unknown numbers of people accused or suspected of being or resembling Boxer rebels, which became the subject of an early short film.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> A [U.S. Marine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Marine "US Marine") wrote that he witnessed German and Russian troops raping and then bayoneting women.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> While the allies were in Beijing, they looted the palaces, [yamens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamen "Yamen"), and government buildings inflicting incalculable loss of cultural relics, books on literature and history (including the famous *[Yongle Dadian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongle_Dadian "Yongle Dadian")*) and damage to cultural heritage (including the [Forbidden City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City "Forbidden City"), the [Summer Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace "Summer Palace"), Xishan and the [Old Summer Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Summer_Palace "Old Summer Palace")).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-loot-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-978-7500407669-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

More than 3,000 gold-plated bronze [Buddhas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas "Buddhas"), 1,400 artistic products and 4,300 bronzes in [Songzhu Temple](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B5%A9%E7%A5%9D%E5%AF%BA "zh:嵩祝寺") (嵩祝寺) were looted. The gold plating on the copper tanks in front of the Forbidden City palaces was scraped off by allied troops, leaving scratch marks that can be seen even now. The *[Yongle Dadian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongle_Encyclopedia "Yongle Encyclopedia")* that was compiled by 2,100 scholars during the [Ming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") [Yongle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongle_Emperor "Yongle Emperor") period (1403–1408), with a total of 22,870 volumes, was partially destroyed in the [Second Opium War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War "Second Opium War") in 1860. Later, it was collected in the Imperial Palace on Nanchizi Street. It was found and destroyed completely by the alliance in 1900. Part of the *Yongle Dadian* was used for the construction of fortifications.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-loot-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-978-7500407669-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

The *[Complete Library of the Four Treasuries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Library_of_the_Four_Treasuries "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries")* (or *Siku Quanshu*) was compiled by 360 scholars during the [Qing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") [Qianlong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong "Qianlong") period. It collected 3,461 ancient books, totaling 79,309 volumes. The whole book consisted of seven sets. One set was destroyed in 1860 during the Second Opium War. Another 10,000 plus volumes were destroyed in 1900 by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The [Hanlin Academy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlin_Academy "Hanlin Academy") houses a collection of precious books, orphans, books of the [Song dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty"), literature and history materials, and precious paintings. The Eight-Nation Alliance looted the collections. Some of these looted books remain in the custody of museums in London and Paris.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-loot-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-978-7500407669-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

Austria-Hungary had a single cruiser, [SMS *Zenta*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Zenta "SMS Zenta"), on station at the beginning of the rebellion, based at the Russian [concession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concessions_in_China "Concessions in China") of [Port Arthur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCshunkou_District "Lüshunkou District").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTESondhaus1994139-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Detachments of sailors from the *Zenta* were the only Austro-Hungarian forces to see action.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTESondhaus1994140-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Some were taking part in defending the legations under siege, and another detachment was involved in the rescue attempts.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTESondhaus1994140-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>

In June, the Austro-Hungarians helped hold the Tianjin railway against Boxer forces and fired upon several armed [junks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_\(ship\) "Junk (ship)") on the [Hai River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_River "Hai River") near [Tongzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhou_District,_Beijing "Tongzhou District, Beijing") in Beijing. They took part in the seizure of the [Taku Forts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taku_Forts "Taku Forts") commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and the boarding and capture of four Chinese [destroyers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer "Destroyer") by [Capt.

The [Austro-Hungarian Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Navy "Austro-Hungarian Navy") sent the cruisers [SMS *Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Kaiserin_und_K%C3%B6nigin_Maria_Theresia "SMS Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia"), [SMS *Kaiserin Elisabeth*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Kaiserin_Elisabeth "SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth"), [SMS *Aspern*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Aspern "SMS Aspern") and a company of marines to China. Arriving in September they were too late since most of the fighting had ended, and the legations had been relieved.

At the outset of the Boxer Rebellion, Britain was engaged in the [Second Boer War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War "Second Boer War") in South Africa.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIon201437-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Consequently, with the army tied down by the war, the British had to rely on the [China Squadron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Squadron "China Squadron") and troops [largely from India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Army "British Indian Army"). The [Royal Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") 's China Squadron, stationed off Tianjin, consisted of the battleships [*Barfleur*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Barfleur_\(1892\) "HMS Barfleur (1892)") and [*Centurion*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Centurion_\(1892\) "HMS Centurion (1892)"), the cruisers [*Alacrity*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprise-class_cruiser#HMS_Alacrity "Surprise-class cruiser"), [*Algerine*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Algerine_\(1895\) "HMS Algerine (1895)"), [*Aurora*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Aurora_\(1887\) "HMS Aurora (1887)"), [*Endymion*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endymion_\(1891\) "HMS Endymion (1891)"), and [*Orlando*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Orlando_\(1886\) "HMS Orlando (1886)"), and the destroyers [*Whiting*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Whiting_\(1896\) "HMS Whiting (1896)") and [*Fame*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Fame_\(1896\) "HMS Fame (1896)").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrington200128-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>

British forces were the third-largest contingent in the alliance and consisted of the following units: [Naval Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Brigade#Royal_Navy "Naval Brigade"), 12th Battery [Royal Field Artillery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Field_Artillery "Royal Field Artillery"), Hong Kong & Singapore Artillery, 2nd Battalion [Royal Welsh Fusiliers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Welsh_Fusiliers "Royal Welsh Fusiliers"), [1st Bengal Lancers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Horse_\(Skinner%27s_Horse\) "1st Horse (Skinner's Horse)"), [7th Rajput Infantry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_\(Duke_of_Connaught%27s_Own\)_Rajputs "7th (Duke of Connaught's Own) Rajputs"), [24th Punjab Infantry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_Punjabis "24th Punjabis"), [1st Sikh Infantry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_Sikhs_\(Frontier_Force\) "51st Sikhs (Frontier Force)"), [Hong Kong Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Regiment "Hong Kong Regiment"), [1st Chinese Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihaiwei_Regiment "Weihaiwei Regiment"), [Royal Engineers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers "Royal Engineers"), and other support personnel.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodin197934-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrington200129-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Australian colonies did not become a unified federation until 1901. As such, several of the colonies, independently of each other, sent contingents of naval and army personnel to support the British contingent. For example, [South Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_navies_of_Australia#South_Australia "Colonial navies of Australia") sent its entire navy: the gunboat [HMCS *Protector*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Protector_\(1884\) "HMAS Protector (1884)").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Australia was not an official member of the Eight-Nation Alliance, and its forces arrived too late to see significant action.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>

German troops with captured Boxer flags

Germany had gained a presence in China after the [Juye Incident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juye_Incident "Juye Incident") in which two German missionaries had been murdered in November 1897. The [concession in Jiaozhou Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozhou_Bay_Leased_Territory "Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory"), with the port of [Qingdao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao "Qingdao"), was used as a naval base for the [East Asia Squadron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Squadron "East Asia Squadron") and a trading port. The German concession was governed and garrisoned by the [Imperial German Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_German_Navy "Imperial German Navy"). At the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in June 1900, the garrison of the concession was composed of the *III. [Seebataillon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seebataillon "Seebataillon")*, with 1,126 men, a marine/naval artillery battery, about 800 men of a *Kommando* Detachment and sailors from the East Asian Squadron.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_QuesadaDale201323-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>

With the increasing threat of the Boxers, a small armed group from the *III. Seebatallion* was sent to Beijing and Tianjin to protect German interests there while the majority of the remaining forces stayed behind to prevent attacks against Qingdao. The siege of the foreign legations in Beijing soon convinced Germany and the other European powers that more forces were needed to be sent to China to reinforce the allied forces. The first troops dispatched from Germany were the marine- *Expeditionskorps* which consisted of the *I.* and *II.

They were soon followed by the *Ostasiatisches Expeditionskorps* (East Asian Expeditionary Corps), which was a force of about 15,000 of mostly volunteers from the regular Army under the command of General [Alfred Count von Waldersee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_von_Waldersee "Alfred von Waldersee"). It comprised initially four and later six two-battalion infantry regiments and a [*jäger*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A4ger_\(infantry\) "Jäger (infantry)") company, single regiments of cavalry and field artillery and various support and logistics units.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_QuesadaDale201323-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> On arrival in China, it incorporated the marine- *Expeditionskorps* that had preceded it to China by a few weeks.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_QuesadaDale201323-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>

Most of the German forces arrived too late to take part in any of the major actions.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_QuesadaDale201323-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> The first elements of the *Expeditionskorps* arrived at Taku on September 21,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_QuesadaDale201323-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> after the legations had been relieved. As a result, most of the *Expeditionskorps* was mainly employed for garrison duties.

French colonial infantry marching through the French concession, Tianjin

Three battalions of marines, the II/9th, and the I and II/11th RIMa which were stationed in [French Indochina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina "French Indochina") were sent to China. They joined the 1st Brigade commanded by General [Henri-Nicolas Frey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri-Nicolas_Frey "Henri-Nicolas Frey"). In July 1900, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of infantry embarked from [Toulon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulon "Toulon") but did not reach China until September. In October, following losses and rotations of duty, the first three battalions sent were included in the 16th regiment of marines by order of General [Régis Voyron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9gis_Voyron "Régis Voyron"), commander in chief of the French Expeditionary Corps in China. On 1 January 1901, the 16th RIMa was renamed the 16th Regiment of colonial infantry. At the end of the campaign, it moved to a new base in Tianjin, with its headquarters in the former buildings of the Chinese admiralty.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1898, the Italians had demanded San Mun Bay as a concession, but the Chinese refused.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPaoletti2008280-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> The [Italian Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regia_Marina "Regia Marina") then dispatched a squadron to San Mun Bay, but no further action was taken. The squadron remained there, and in the summer of 1900, when the Boxer Rebellion broke out, detachments from Italian cruisers were sent to Beijing. Italian forces were initially made up of sailors from warships.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodin197929-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Some of them helped the French defend the Pei Tang Catholic cathedral, and another defended the European Legations in Beijing during the 55-day siege.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPaoletti2008280-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> Italian sailors also took part in the attacks on the Taku forts and in capturing Tianjin.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPaoletti2008280-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>

A larger contingent was later dispatched from Italy, including 83 officers, 1,882 troops, and 178 horses. The contingent included a battalion of [Bersaglieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bersaglieri "Bersaglieri"), which was formed from one company each from the [2nd Bersaglieri Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Bersaglieri_Regiment "2nd Bersaglieri Regiment"), [4th Bersaglieri Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Bersaglieri_Regiment "4th Bersaglieri Regiment"), [5th Bersaglieri Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Bersaglieri_Regiment "5th Bersaglieri Regiment"), and [8th Bersaglieri Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_Bersaglieri_Regiment "8th Bersaglieri Regiment"). In addition, the 24th Infantry Regiment of the [Brigade "Como"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_%22Como%22 "Brigade \"Como\""), volunteers from the [Alpini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpini "Alpini"), a battery of machine guns, and some engineers were also sent to China.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodin197929-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> A battery of field guns was also supplied by the Italian Navy.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodin197929-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> The total force of 1,965 officers and men, which composed the Italian expeditionary force against the Boxers, was officially referred to as the [Italian Royal Troops in China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Italian_Royal_Troops_in_China&action=edit&redlink=1 "Italian Royal Troops in China (page does not exist)").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPaoletti2008280-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> In August 1900, when the larger force reached the capital, the Italians had seven cruisers and 2,543 men in the country.

The larger part of the approximately 2,000 Italian soldiers and officers who fought in the campaign against the Boxers were recalled from Beijing after the end of the conflict. Italy obtained a 151-acre (61 ha) concession area in Tianjin and the right to occupy the [Shanhai Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanhai_Pass "Shanhai Pass") fort.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Smith2012-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPaoletti2008280-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> A small naval squadron and a naval garrison were maintained in China to protect Italian interests there.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPaoletti2008280-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>

Japanese marines who served under the British commander [Edward Hobart Seymour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hobart_Seymour "Edward Hobart Seymour")

Japan provided the largest contingent of troops; 20,840, as well as 18 warships. Of the total number, 20,300 were [Imperial Japanese Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army "Imperial Japanese Army") troops of the [5th Infantry Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Division_\(Imperial_Japanese_Army\) "5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)") under Lieutenant General [Yamaguchi Motomi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaguchi_Motomi "Yamaguchi Motomi"); the remainder were 540 naval *rikusentai* (Marines) from the [Imperial Japanese Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy "Imperial Japanese Navy").

At the beginning of the Boxer Rebellion, the Japanese had only 215 troops in northern China stationed at Tianjin, nearly all of whom were naval *rikusentai* from the [*Kasagi*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Kasagi "Japanese cruiser Kasagi") and the [*Atago*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_gunboat_Atago "Japanese gunboat Atago"), under the command of Captain [Shimamura Hayao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimamura_Hayao "Shimamura Hayao").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIon201444-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> The Japanese were able to contribute 52 men to the [Seymour Expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Expedition "Seymour Expedition").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIon201444-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> On 12 June the advance of the Seymour Expedition was halted some 30 miles from the capital, by mixed Boxer and Chinese regular army forces. The vastly-outnumbered allies withdrew to the vicinity of Tianjin and had suffered more than 300 casualties.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200997-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup>

The [army general staff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army_General_Staff "Imperial Japanese Army General Staff") in Tokyo had become aware of the worsening conditions in China and had drafted ambitious contingency plans,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> but the government, in the wake of the [Triple Intervention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Intervention "Triple Intervention") five years earlier, refused to deploy a large contingent of troops unless it was requested by the western powers.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> Three days later a provisional force of 1,300 troops, commanded by Major General [Fukushima Yasumasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Yasumasa "Fukushima Yasumasa"), was deployed to northern China. Fukushima was chosen because he spoke English, which let him communicate with the British commander. The force landed near Tianjin on 5 July.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup>

On 17 June naval *Rikusentai* from the *Kasagi* and *Atago* had joined British, Russian and German sailors to seize the Taku forts, near Tianjin.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> The British, in light of the precarious situation, were compelled to ask Japan for additional reinforcements since the Japanese had the only readily available forces in the region.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> Britain at the time was heavily engaged in the Boer War, and so much of the British Army was tied down in South Africa. In addition, deploying large numbers of troops from its [garrisons in India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Army "British Indian Army") would take too much time and weaken internal security there.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup>

Overriding personal doubts, Foreign Minister [Aoki Shūzō](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoki_Sh%C5%ABz%C5%8D "Aoki Shūzō") calculated that the advantages of participating in an allied coalition were too attractive to ignore. Prime Minister [Yamagata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamagata_Aritomo "Yamagata Aritomo") likewise concurred, but others in the cabinet demanded that guarantees from the British in return for the risks and costs of the major deployment of Japanese troops.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> On 6 July the 5th Infantry Division was alerted for possible deployment to China, but no timetable was set for its deployment. On 8 July, with more ground troops urgently needed to lift the siege of the foreign legations at Beijing, the British ambassador offered the Japanese government one million [pound sterling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") in exchange for Japanese participation.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup>

Shortly afterward, advance units of the 5th Division departed for China, bringing Japanese strength to 3,800 members of the 17,000-strong allied force.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> The commander of the 5th Division, Lieutenant General Yamaguchi Motoomi, had taken operational control from Fukushima. Japanese troops were involved in the [storming of Tianjin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tientsin "Battle of Tientsin") on 14 July,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> and the allies later consolidated and awaited the remainder of the 5th Division and other coalition reinforcements. The siege of legations was lifted on 14 August; the Japanese force of 13,000 was the largest single contingent, making up about 40% of the approximately 33,000-strong allied expeditionary force.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200998-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup>

Japanese troops involved in the fighting had acquitted themselves well although a British military observer felt that their aggressiveness, densely-packed formations, and overly aggressive attacks cost them excessive and disproportionate casualties.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200999-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, during the Tianjin fighting, the Japanese suffered more than half of the allied casualties, 400 out of 730, but made up less than one quarter (3,800) of the force of 17,000.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200999-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Similarly at Beijing, the Japanese accounted for almost two thirds of the losses, 280 of 453, but constituted slightly less than half of the assault force.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrea200999-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>

Russian troops during the Boxer Rebellion

Russia supplied the second largest force, after Japan, with 12,400 troops consisting mainly of garrisons from Port Arthur and [Vladivostok](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok "Vladivostok").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> On 30 November 1900, Admiral [Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeni_Ivanovich_Alekseyev "Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev") compelled the Chinese military governor of [Shenyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang "Shenyang"), Zeng Qi, to sign an agreement that effectively ended Chinese sovereignty over [Manchuria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria") and placed it under Russian control.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-March1996-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup>
