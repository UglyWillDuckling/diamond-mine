Orff is best known for *[Carmina Burana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana_\(Orff\) "Carmina Burana (Orff)")* (1936), a "scenic [cantata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantata "Cantata")". It is the first part of a trilogy that also includes *[Catulli Carmina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catulli_Carmina "Catulli Carmina")* and *[Trionfo di Afrodite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trionfo_di_Afrodite "Trionfo di Afrodite")*. *Carmina Burana* reflects his interest in [medieval German poetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_High_German_literature "Middle High German literature"). The trilogy as a whole is called *[Trionfi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trionfi_\(Orff\) "Trionfi (Orff)")*, or "Triumphs". The work is based on thirteenth-century poetry found in a manuscript dubbed the *Codex latinus monacensis* found in the [Benedictine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine "Benedictine") [monastery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benediktbeuern_Abbey "Benediktbeuern Abbey") of [Benediktbeuern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benediktbeuern "Benediktbeuern") in 1803 and written by the [Goliards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliard "Goliard"); this collection is also known as *[Carmina Burana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana "Carmina Burana")*. While "modern" in some of his compositional techniques, Orff was able to capture the spirit of the [medieval period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") in this trilogy. The medieval poems, written in [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and an early form of German, are a lament about the [cruel indifference of fate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Fortuna "O Fortuna") (the brief opening and closing sections of Orff's work are titled "Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi", i.e., "Fortune, Ruler of the World"). The chorus that opens and concludes *Carmina Burana*, "[O Fortuna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Fortuna_\(Orff\) "O Fortuna (Orff)")", is often used to denote primal forces, for example in the [Oliver Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone "Oliver Stone") film *[The Doors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_\(film\) "The Doors (film)")*.[^195] The work's association with fascism also led [Pier Paolo Pasolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Paolo_Pasolini "Pier Paolo Pasolini") to use the movement "Veris leta facies" to accompany the concluding scenes of torture and murder in his final film *[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom "Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom")*.[^196] Pasolini was concerned with the question of art being appropriated by power when he made the film, which has relevance to Orff's situation.[^footnotekohler201530%e2%80%9331-197]

### Relationship to pre-*Carmina Burana* works

Orff often said that, following a dress rehearsal for *Carmina Burana*, he told his publisher the following: "Everything that I have written up until now and that you, unfortunately, have printed you now can pulp. With *Carmina Burana* begins my collected works."[^198][^199] Michael H. Kater has called this statement into question, citing a lack of documentary evidence and the continuation of performances of Orff's previous works after the premiere of *Carmina Burana*,[^footnotekater2000139-200] although in fact most of these performances used revised versions.[^footnotekohler2015115%e2%80%93116_and_130%e2%80%9332-201][^202] Orff eventually qualified his oft-repeated statement: "So I had said this thoughtlessly, con leggerezza \[i.e. "lightly"\]: a remark that, as I well knew, was true and also not true. I only wanted to accentuate with it the meaning that the *Carmina Burana* held in my creations up to that point, as was clear to me myself."[^footnoteorff1975%e2%80%93198366,_vol._iv_(english_translation_from_kohler_2015,_p._115)-203] When asked about the quotation in 1975, Orff replied: "For the first time I had done exactly what I wanted, and I also knew that I had treated it right. Really there is nothing more to say."[^204] Orff went on to revise many of his earlier works, and later in his career he reissued some of his pre-*Carmina Burana* compositions with minimal revisions. One of his final publications was a volume of songs he had composed between 1911 and 1920.[^205]

Most of Orff's later works – *[Antigonae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonae "Antigonae")* (1949), *[Oedipus der Tyrann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oedipus_der_Tyrann&action=edit&redlink=1 "Oedipus der Tyrann (page does not exist)") \[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_der_Tyrann "de:Oedipus der Tyrann")\]* (*Oedipus the Tyrant*, 1959), *[Prometheus desmotes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_\(Orff\) "Prometheus (Orff)")* (*Prometheus Bound*, 1968), and *[De temporum fine comoedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_temporum_fine_comoedia "De temporum fine comoedia")* (*Play on the End of Times*, 1973) – were based on texts or topics from antiquity. They extend the language of *Carmina Burana* in interesting ways, but they are expensive to stage and (on Orff's own characterization) are not operas in the conventional sense.[^206] Live performances of them have been few, even in Germany.[^footnotewillnauer199511-207]

In a letter dated 8 January 1947 to his student [Heinrich Sutermeister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Sutermeister "Heinrich Sutermeister"), Orff called *Die Bernauerin* "the last piece in the series of my earlier work; *Antigonae* starts a new phase."[^footnotekohler2015318-208] *Antigonae* is a setting of Friedrich Hölderlin's translation of the [play](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_\(Sophocles_play\) "Antigone (Sophocles play)") by [Sophocles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles "Sophocles"). Orff first became interested in this source material shortly after his trauma in World War I and began planning his work late in 1940.[^footnoter%c3%b6sch2021a26-209] The premiere took place on 9 August 1949 at the [Salzburg Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg_Festival "Salzburg Festival"). Orff followed *Antigonae* with *Oedipus der Tyrann*, also using Hölderlin's translation of [Sophocles's play](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex "Oedipus Rex"), and *Prometheus,* using the original language of the [Greek play](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_Bound "Prometheus Bound") attributed to [Aeschylus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschylus "Aeschylus"). Their premieres took place in Stuttgart, respectively in 1959 and 1968, conducted by [Ferdinand Leitner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Leitner "Ferdinand Leitner"). All three of the Greek tragedies make no cuts or alterations to the texts.[^footnoter%c3%b6sch200317-210]

The Greek tragedies are scored for highly unusual ensembles centered on large percussion ensembles, which include non-Western instruments and numerous mallet instruments (including [lithophone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophone "Lithophone")), and several pianos (four in *Prometheus* and six in the other two); the traditional string section is dispensed with excepting nine contrabasses. They also have six flutes and six oboes (with various auxiliary doublings of piccolo, alto flute, and English horn), as well as trumpets (six in *Antigonae* and *Prometheus*; eight in *Oedipus der Tyrann*, behind the scene). *Oedipus der Tyrann* and *Prometheus* also have six trombones and organ. All three works also have four harps; there is additionally mandolin in *Oedipus der Tyrann* and four tenor banjos in *Prometheus*.

Following the premiere of *Prometheus*, [Everett Helm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Helm "Everett Helm") wrote:

> Orff does not make things easy for either singers or audience. But the retention of the original text undoubtedly evoked a mood such as could not have been created by a modern language.
> 
> "Prometheus" is not an opera in the usual sense. Like other works by Orff, it is music theater in which the music is part of, and subordinated to, the dramatic whole. The voices declaim almost constantly – either in spoken rhythm or in a kind of psalmodic recitative. Only occasionally (and most effectively) does the stark psalmody give way to melismas that recall the more florid passages of Gregorian chant. There is no semblance of arias or concerted numbers.
> 
> ... Brief interludes in the orchestra have the character of interjections. There is no development, either musical or psychological. The huge blocks of sound produce a static, immobile form and atmosphere ... The makeup of the orchestra ... produces, hard, metallic sounds, mercilessly driven by primitive ostinato rhythms. The whole effect is elemental to a degree, but in no sense naive. Orff's stylized primitivism masks a high degree of sophistication.[^211]

Orff's final work for the stage, *[De temporum fine comoedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_temporum_fine_comoedia "De temporum fine comoedia")* (*Play on the End of Times*), had its premiere at the [Salzburg Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg_Festival "Salzburg Festival") on 20 August 1973, performed by [Herbert von Karajan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_von_Karajan "Herbert von Karajan") and the [WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDR_Symphony_Orchestra_Cologne "WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne") and Chorus. It has a large cast and similar scoring to the Greek tragedies with some exceptions, notably clarinetists (all with E-flat clarinets) instead of oboists and the addition of contrabassoon, horns, and tuba. Thomas Rösch has called this work "in many respects the summation of \[Orff's\] entire work."[^footnoter%c3%b6sch20041401;_original_language:_%22in_vielerlei_hinsicht_die_summe_des_gesamten_schaffens%22-212] There is no evidence Orff considered writing another stage work after *De temporum fine comoedia*, and in 1979 he told an interviewer he was certain it was the end (*Schluß*) of his composition.[^213] In this highly personal work, Orff presented a [mystery play](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_play "Mystery play"), sung in Greek, German, and Latin, in which he summarized his view of the end of time. His philosophy draws from many religious traditions, primarily [Origen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen "Origen")'s idea of [apocatastasis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocatastasis "Apocatastasis"). *De temporum fine comoedia* also makes numerous references to Orff's previous compositions, notably *Die Bernauerin*.[^footnoter%c3%b6sch2021b178%e2%80%93189-214][^footnoter%c3%b6sch2015247%e2%80%93299-215][^footnotekohler2015336%e2%80%93360-216] Around the time of the premiere, he said that his works are "as with an onion: one layer follows the others." On the same occasion, he said of *De temporum fine comoedia*: "It is all a dream, only a fantasy. Pessimistic, optimistic, as anyone wants."[^217]

In [pedagogical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy "Pedagogy") circles he is probably best remembered for his *[Schulwerk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orff_Schulwerk "Orff Schulwerk")* ("School Work"). Originally a set of pieces composed and published for the *Güntherschule* (which had students ranging from 12 to 22),[^218] this title was also used for his books based on radio broadcasts in Bavaria in 1949. These pieces are collectively called *Musik für Kinder* (*Music for Children*), and also use the term *Schulwerk*, and were written in collaboration with his former pupil, composer and educator [Gunild Keetman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunild_Keetman "Gunild Keetman") (1904–1990), who actually wrote most of the settings and arrangements in the "Musik für Kinder" ("Music for Children") volumes.

Orff's ideas were developed, together with Gunild Keetman, into a very innovative approach to music education for children, known as the Orff Schulwerk. The music is elemental and combines movement, singing, playing, and improvisation.

*[Gassenhauer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gassenhauer "Gassenhauer")*, *Hexeneinmaleins*, and *Passion*, which Orff composed with Keetman, were used as theme music for [Terrence Malick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick "Terrence Malick")'s film *[Badlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_\(film\) "Badlands (film)")* (1973).
