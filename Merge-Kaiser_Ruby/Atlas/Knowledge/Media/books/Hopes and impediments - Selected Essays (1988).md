Several of the essays caution against generalizing all [African people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa "Ethnic groups of Africa") into a monolithic culture, or using [Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") as a facile [metaphor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor").[^e-y-2] The opening essay, "[An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Image_of_Africa:_Racism_in_Conrad%27s_%22Heart_of_Darkness%22 "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\"")", challenged the prevailing opinions in the west about [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad")'s depiction of African people.[^grossman-3] He also discusses several notable authors and shares his opinion on the role of writers and writing in cultures. In a contemporary review, Chris Dunton wrote: "The essays in his new book remind us also how tough-minded, how properly insistent, he can be in exposing false and demeaning ideas about Africa and its culture."[^ezenwa-ohaeto-4] The book is dedicated to Professor [Michael Thelwell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Thelwell "Michael Thelwell").[^french-5]
