***Cry Freedom*** is a 1987 [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film "Epic film") [biographical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film "Biographical film") [drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_\(film_and_television\) "Drama (film and television)") film directed and produced by [Richard Attenborough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Attenborough "Richard Attenborough"), set in late-1970s [apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid")\-era [South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"). The screenplay was written by [John Briley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Briley "John Briley") based on a pair of books by journalist [Donald Woods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Woods "Donald Woods"). The film centres on the real-life events involving South African activist [Steve Biko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Biko "Steve Biko") and his friend Woods, who initially finds him too radical, and attempts to understand his way of life. [Denzel Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington "Denzel Washington") stars as Biko, while [Kevin Kline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kline "Kevin Kline") portrays Woods. [Penelope Wilton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_Wilton "Penelope Wilton") co-stars as Woods' wife [Wendy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Woods "Wendy Woods"). *Cry Freedom* delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [Universal Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures "Universal Pictures") and Marble Arch Productions and the film was primarily shot on location in [Zimbabwe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe "Zimbabwe") due to not being allowed to film in South Africa at the time of production. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures, opening in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") on 6 November 1987. South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.[^nytimescryfreedom-3]

The film was generally met with favourable reviews and earned [theatrical rentals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_rental "Theatrical rental") of $15 million worldwide. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award "Academy Award") nominations for [Best Supporting Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor") (for Washington), [Best Original Score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Academy Award for Best Original Score"), and [Best Original Song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song "Academy Award for Best Original Song"). It was nominated for seven [BAFTA Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award "BAFTA Award"), including [Best Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Film "BAFTA Award for Best Film") and [Best Direction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Direction "BAFTA Award for Best Direction"), and won [Best Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Sound "BAFTA Award for Best Sound").

Among mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mostly positive reviews. [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes") reported that 74% of 27 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.5 out of 10.[^rt-12] [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic") assigned the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews."[^13] Audiences polled by [CinemaScore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScore "CinemaScore") gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[^14]

| "It can be admired for its sheer scale. Most of all, it can be appreciated for what it tries to communicate about heroism, loyalty and leadership, about the horrors of apartheid, about the martyrdom of a rare man." |

Rita Kempley, writing in *[The Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")*, said actor Washington gave a "zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25."[^16] Also writing for *The Washington Post*, [Desson Howe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desson_Howe "Desson Howe") thought the film "could have reached further" and felt the story centring on Woods's character was "its major flaw". He saw director Attenborough's aims as "more academic and political than dramatic". Overall, he expressed his disappointment by exclaiming, "In a country busier than [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile") with oppression, violence and subjugation, the story of Woods' slow awakening is certainly not the most exciting, or revealing."[^howe-17]

[Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") in the *[Chicago Sun-Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times "Chicago Sun-Times")* offered a mixed review calling it a "sincere and valuable movie" while also exclaiming, "Interesting things were happening, the performances were good and it is always absorbing to see how other people live." But on a negative front, he noted how the film "promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border. It's sort of a liberal yuppie version of that [Disney movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Crossing "Night Crossing") where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom."[^18]

[Janet Maslin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin "Janet Maslin") writing in *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* saw the film as "bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others" but pointed out that "it isn't dull. Its frankly grandiose style is transporting in its way, as is the story itself, even in this watered-down form." She also complimented the African scenery, noting that "*Cry Freedom* can also be admired for Ronnie Taylor's picturesque cinematography".[^maslin-15] The *[Variety Staff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* felt Washington did "a remarkable job of transforming himself into the articulte \[*[sic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")*\] and mesmerizing black nationalist leader, whose refusal to keep silent led to his death in police custody and a subsequent coverup." On Kline's performance, they noticed how his "low-key screen presence serves him well in his portrayal of the strong-willed but even-tempered journalist."[^19] Film critic [Gene Siskel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel "Gene Siskel") of the *[Chicago Tribune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune "Chicago Tribune")* gave the film a *thumbs up* review calling it "fresh" and a "solid adventure" while commenting "its images do remain in the mind ... I admire this film very much." He thought both Washington's and Kline's portrayals were "effective" and "quite good".[^20] Similarly, Michael Price writing in the *[Fort Worth Press](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Press "Fort Worth Press")* viewed *Cry Freedom* as often "harrowing and naturalistic but ultimately self-important in its indictment of police-state politics."[^21]

| "Attenborough tries to rally with Biko flashbacks and a depiction of the Soweto massacre. But the 1976 slaughter of black schoolchildren is chronologically and dramatically out of place. And the flashbacks only remind you of whom you'd rather be watching." |

| â€”Desson Howe, writing for *The Washington Post*[^howe-17] |

Mark Salisbury of *[Time Out](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_\(magazine\) "Time Out (magazine)")* wrote of the lead acting to be "excellent" and the crowd scenes "astonishing", while equally observing how the climax was "truly nerve-wracking". He called it "an implacable work of authority and compassion, *Cry Freedom* is political cinema at its best."[^22] James Sanford, however, writing for the *[Kalamazoo Gazette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo_Gazette "Kalamazoo Gazette")*, did not appreciate the film's qualities, calling it "a Hollywood whitewashing of a potentially explosive story."[^23] Rating the film with *3 Stars*, critic [Leonard Maltin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Maltin "Leonard Maltin") wrote that the film was a "sweeping and compassionate film". He did, however, note that the film "loses momentum as it spends too much time on Kline and his family's escape from South Africa". But in positive followup, he pointed out that it "cannily injects flashbacks of Biko to steer it back on course."[^24]

[John Simon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Simon_\(critic\) "John Simon (critic)") of the *[National Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review "National Review")* called *Cry Freedom* "grandiosely inept".[^25]

In 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by [David Sirota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sirota "David Sirota") in *[Salon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_\(website\) "Salon (website)")* in an article concerning [white saviour narratives in film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film "White savior narrative in film").[^sirota-26]
