### **[[DOM]]** : document object model

**Models** the [[HTML]] as a [[tree data structure]] in the computer memory.

 A **collection of objects** in the memory that represent HTML elements that define a web page.

The DOM is based on the HTML text that it is built on.

- Provides the ability to `analyze` and `manipulate` the elements on the page.
- & as you change the DOM, what the user sees and can interact with also changes

### **Rendering**

making the **DOM** tree, the HTML content itself available to the user both visually and tangibily.

prev:`=this.previous` , next: `=this.next`
