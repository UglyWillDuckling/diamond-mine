## ðŸ”¼The name Kenan: Summary

Meaning

Networker, Composer

Etymology

From the verb ×§× ×Ÿ (*qanan*), to weave into dynamic networks.

## ðŸ”½The name Kenan in the Bible

Kenan is the son of [Enosh](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Enosh.html), the son of [Seth](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Seth.html), the third son of [Adam](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Adam.html) and [Eve](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Eve.html) (Genesis 5:9). Apart from the mysterious Cainan, the name Kenan is used only once in the Bible. We don't know what became of him, except that he died before the flood of [Noah](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Noah.html).

## ðŸ”½Etymology of the name Kenan

The name Kenan obviously derives from the root ×§× ×Ÿ (*qanan*), which describes the act of weaving any kinds of strands into dynamic networks:

Excerpted from: Abarim Publications' Biblical Dictionary

###### ×§× ×Ÿ

The verb ×§× ×Ÿ (*qanan*) isn't used in the Bible but it appears to tell of the weaving of many strands into a dynamic and interlocked network. These strands may be reeds and twigs that a bird weaves into a nest, or it may be acts of trade and routes of commerce that together combine into a bustling economy. Noun ×§×Ÿ (*qen*) means nest, and verb ×§× ×Ÿ (*qinnen*) means to make a nest.

Verb ×§× ×” (*qana*) means to obtain, i.e. to acquire or in some instances to create. It's the regular verb for a commercial purchase. Noun ×§× ×™×Ÿ (*qinyan*) describes an item acquired (or created). Noun ×ž×§× ×” (*migneh*) means cattle (as unit of commerce). Noun ×ž×§× ×” (*miqna*) means purchase or purchase-price. Noun ×§× ×” (*qaneh*) denotes some herb on a stalk, or any rod, reed, branch- or stalk-like item (in this sense, a plant "acquires" its branches).

The verb ×§×™×Ÿ (*qyn*), which isn't used in the Bible, occurs in cognate language with the meaning of to fit together, fabricate or forge (often of metal things). In the Bible occurs only the noun ×§×™×Ÿ (*qayin*), meaning spear. Note that our modern word "franchise" comes from a word that meant spear, and originally denoted a free man, i.e. one who had the authority to bear arms, own property and thus conduct trade. The earliest republican government of [Rome](https://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Rome.html) was called [*curia*](https://www.abarim-publications.com/DictionaryG/k/k-u-r-i-o-sfin.html), literally spear-bearers, and the link between bearing a spear or other such ceremonial weapon and a senatorial government (a government by tribal elders) appears to have been pretty much globally understood throughout history.

Noun ×§×™× ×” (*qina*) denotes a kind of sad poem; a dirge or lamentation, which both had to be fabricated and could, presumably, pierce a person's soul like a spear (which is an obvious Biblical figure of speech; see Luke 2:35). The denominative verb ×§×•× ×Ÿ (*qonen*) means to do a dirge, which could be either to chant or compose one.

The verb ×ª×§×Ÿ (*taqan*) means to make or become straight.

## ðŸ”½Kenan meaning

Jones' Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names proclaims that the name Kenan (×§×™× ×Ÿ) is the same as Cain (×§×™×Ÿ), which is obviously not the case, and renders both **Possession**, which is inaccurate too as our verb does not describe possessing, which is a static affair, but rather acquiring, which is a dynamic affair.

The name Kenan may even be construed to come specifically from the verb ×§×•× ×Ÿ (*qonen*), to chant a dirge (Ezekiel 27:32, 1 Samuel 1:17), from the noun ×§×™× ×” (*qina*), lamentation or sad poem which is sung (Jeremiah 7:19, Ezekiel 2:10). That way the name Kenan means **Lamenter**, but with the emphasis on the composition rather than the actual lamenting.

However, through the apparently related name Kenite, Jones' Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names notes a relation to the verb ×§× ×Ÿ (*qinnen*), meaning to make a nest (Isaiah 34:15). That way the name Kenan may mean **Nester**, but again emphasizing the constructing rather than the perching.

NOBSE Study Bible Name List reads **Fixed** for both Cainan and Kenan, which fails to incorporate the signature dynamic nature of the verb.
