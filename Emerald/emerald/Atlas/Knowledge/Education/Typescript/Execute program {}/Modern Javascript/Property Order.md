## intro

> In many languages, properties in objects don't have a guaranteed order. (Some languages call their object-like data structures "hashes" or "dictionaries", but for our purposes here these are all the same thing.)


## in short
Consistent ordering is nice; it's one less thing to think about. Fortunately, modern versions of JavaScript guarantee object key ordering!

An object's keys will be in the order that they were defined in the object.
