***A People's History of the United States*** is a 1980 [nonfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonfiction "Nonfiction") book (updated in 2003) by American historian and [political scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_scientist "Political scientist") [Howard Zinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Zinn "Howard Zinn"). In the book, Zinn presented what he considered to be a different side of history from the more traditional "fundamental nationalist glorification of country".[^1] Zinn portrays a side of [American history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_history "American history") that can largely be seen as the exploitation and manipulation of the majority by rigged systems that hugely favor a small aggregate of elite rulers from across the orthodox political parties.

*A People's History* has been assigned as reading in many high schools and colleges across the United States.[^2] It has also resulted in a change in the focus of historical work, which now includes stories that previously were ignored.[^1] The book was a runner-up in 1980 for the [National Book Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Book_Award "National Book Award"). It frequently has been revised, with the most recent edition covering events through 2002. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the *[Prix des Amis du Monde Diplomatique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde_diplomatique "Le Monde diplomatique")* for the French version of this book *Une histoire populaire des États-Unis.*[^3] More than two million copies have been sold.

In a 1998 interview, Zinn said he had set "quiet revolution" as his goal for writing *A People's History*: "Not a revolution in the classical sense of a seizure of power, but rather from people beginning to take power from within the institutions. In the workplace, the workers would take power to control the conditions of their lives." [^4] In 2004, Zinn edited a primary source [companion volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_volume "Companion volume") with [Anthony Arnove](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Arnove&action=edit&redlink=1 "Anthony Arnove (page does not exist)"), titled *[Voices of a People's History of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voices_of_a_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States "Voices of a People's History of the United States")*.

*A People's History of the United States* has been criticized by various pundits and fellow historians. Critics, including professor [Chris Beneke](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Beneke&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chris Beneke (page does not exist)") and [Randall J. Stephens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_J._Stephens "Randall J. Stephens"),[^5] assert blatant omissions of important historical episodes, uncritical reliance on biased sources, and failure to examine opposing views.[^6] [^7] Conversely, others have defended Zinn and the accuracy and intellectual integrity of his work.[^8] [^9] [^10]

## Overview

In a letter responding to a 2007 critical review of his *A Young People's History of the United States* (a release of the title for younger readers) in *The New York Times Book Review*, Zinn wrote:

> My history... describes the inspiring struggle of those who have fought slavery and racism ([Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass "Frederick Douglass"), [William Lloyd Garrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lloyd_Garrison "William Lloyd Garrison"), [Fannie Lou Hamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Lou_Hamer "Fannie Lou Hamer"), [Bob Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Moses_\(activist\) "Bob Moses (activist)")), of the labor organizers who have led strikes for the rights of working people ([Big Bill Haywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bill_Haywood "Big Bill Haywood"), [Mother Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harris_Jones "Mary Harris Jones"), [César Chávez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Ch%C3%A1vez "César Chávez")), of the socialists and others who have protested war and militarism ([Eugene V. Debs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs "Eugene V. Debs"), [Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller "Helen Keller"), the Rev. [Daniel Berrigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Berrigan "Daniel Berrigan"), [Cindy Sheehan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Sheehan "Cindy Sheehan")). My hero is not [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt"), who loved war and congratulated a general after a [massacre of Filipino villagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Crater_massacre "Moro Crater massacre") at the turn of the century, but [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain "Mark Twain"), who denounced the massacre and satirized [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_imperialism "American imperialism").[^11] [^12] I want young people to understand that ours is a beautiful country, but it has been taken over by men who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties. Our people are basically decent and caring, and our highest ideals are expressed in the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence"), which says that all of us have an equal right to " [life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_liberty,_and_the_pursuit_of_happiness "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness")." The history of our country, I point out in my book, is a striving, against corporate [robber barons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_\(industrialist\) "Robber baron (industrialist)") and war makers, to make those ideals a reality—and all of us, of whatever age, can find immense satisfaction in becoming part of that.[^13]

Chapter 1, "Columbus, the Indians, and Human Progress" covers early [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") civilization in North America and the Bahamas, the enslavement committed by the crew of [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") (whom Zinn accused of [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide")), and incidents of violent colonization by early settlers. Instead of restating the same history that has been presented for centuries, Zinn states that he prefers to tell history from the perspective of the [Arawaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak "Arawak"), which many people are not familiar with. He describes the purpose of Columbus' expedition and his brutality towards the natives after his arrival. Not only does he use firsthand account of witnesses to Columbus' presence in the islands, he also provides statistics of native casualties to present this different side of history. Topics include the [Arawaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak_peoples "Arawak peoples"), [Bartolomé de las Casas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas "Bartolomé de las Casas"), the [Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec"), [Hernán Cortés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s "Hernán Cortés"), [Pizarro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizarro "Pizarro"), [Powhatan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powhatan "Powhatan"), the [Pequot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequot "Pequot"), the [Narragansett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narragansett_\(tribe\) "Narragansett (tribe)"), [Metacom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacom "Metacom"), [King Philip's War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Philip%27s_War "King Philip's War"), and the [Iroquois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois "Iroquois").

Chapter 2, "Drawing the Color Line" addresses the [slave trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States "Slavery in the colonial history of the United States") and servitude of poor [White people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people "White people") in the [Thirteen Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies"). Zinn writes of the methods by which he says racism was created artificially in order to enforce the economic system. He argues that racism is not natural because there are recorded instances of camaraderie and cooperation between enslaved Blacks and White servants in escaping from and in opposing their subjugation.

Chapter 3, "Persons of Mean and Vile Condition" describes [Bacon's Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_Rebellion "Bacon's Rebellion") (1676), the economic conditions of the poor in the colonies, and opposition to their poverty. Zinn uses [Nathaniel Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Bacon_\(Virginia_colonist_and_rebel\) "Nathaniel Bacon (Virginia colonist and rebel)") 's rebellion to assert that "class lines hardened through the colonial period".[^14]

Chapter 4, "Tyranny Is Tyranny" covers the movement for "leveling" (economic equality) in the colonies and the causes of the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution"). Zinn argues that the [Founding Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "Founding Fathers of the United States") agitated for war to distract the people from their own economic problems and to stop popular movements, a strategy that he claims the country's leaders would continue to use in the future.

Chapter 5, "A Kind of Revolution" covers the war and resistance to participating in war, the effects on the Native American people, and the continued inequalities in the new United States. When the land of veterans of the Revolutionary War was seized for non-payment of taxes, it led to instances of resistance to the government, as in the case of [Shays' Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion "Shays' Rebellion"). Zinn notes that " [Charles Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard "Charles A. Beard") warned us that governments—including the government of the United States—are not neutral... they represent the dominant economic interests, and... their constitutions are intended to serve these interests." [^15]

Chapter 6, "The Intimately Oppressed" describes resistance to inequalities in the lives of women in the early years of the U.S. Zinn tells the stories of women who resisted the status quo, including [Polly Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Baker "Polly Baker"), [Anne Hutchinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hutchinson "Anne Hutchinson"), [Mary Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Dyer "Mary Dyer"), [Amelia Bloomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Bloomer "Amelia Bloomer"), [Catharine Beecher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharine_Beecher "Catharine Beecher"), [Emma Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Willard "Emma Willard"), [Harriot Kezia Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriot_Kezia_Hunt "Harriot Kezia Hunt"), [Elizabeth Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Blackwell_\(doctor\) "Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)"), [Lucy Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Stone "Lucy Stone"), [Elizabeth Cady Stanton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton "Elizabeth Cady Stanton"), [Margaret Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Fuller "Margaret Fuller"), [Sarah Grimké](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Grimk%C3%A9 "Sarah Grimké"), [Angelina Grimké](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Grimk%C3%A9 "Angelina Grimké"), [Dorothea Dix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Dix "Dorothea Dix"), [Frances Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Wright "Frances Wright"), [Lucretia Mott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia_Mott "Lucretia Mott"), and [Sojourner Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth "Sojourner Truth").

> If you look through high school textbooks and elementary school textbooks in American history, you will find Andrew Jackson the frontiersman, soldier, democrat, man of the people—not Jackson the slaveholder, land speculator, executioner of dissident soldiers, exterminator of Indians.

— [Howard Zinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Zinn "Howard Zinn"),  
*A People's History of the United States* [^16]

Chapter 7, "As Long As Grass Grows or Water Runs" discusses 19th century conflicts between the U.S. government and Native Americans (such as the [Seminole Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_Wars "Seminole Wars")) and [Indian removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal "Indian removal"), especially during the administrations of [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson") and [Martin Van Buren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren "Martin Van Buren").

Chapter 8, "We Take Nothing by Conquest, Thank God" describes the [Mexican–American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War "Mexican–American War"). Zinn writes that President [James Polk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Polk "James Polk") agitated for war for the purpose of [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"). Zinn argues that the war was unpopular, but that some newspapers of that era misrepresented the popular sentiment.[^17]

Chapter 9, "Slavery Without Submission, Emancipation Without Freedom" addresses [slave rebellions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_rebellion "Slave rebellion"), the [abolition movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States "Abolitionism in the United States"), the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), and the effect of these events on African-Americans. Zinn writes that the large-scale violence of the war was used to end slavery instead of the small-scale violence of the rebellions because the latter may have expanded beyond anti-slavery, resulting in a movement against the [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") system. He writes that the war could limit the freedom granted to African-Americans by allowing the government control over how that freedom was gained.

Chapter 10, "The Other Civil War", covers the [Anti-Rent movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rent_War "Anti-Rent War"), the [Dorr Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion "Dorr Rebellion"), the [Flour Riot of 1837](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_Riot_of_1837 "Flour Riot of 1837"), the [New York City draft riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots "New York City draft riots"), the [Molly Maguires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Maguires "Molly Maguires"), the rise of [labor unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_union "Labor union"), the [Lowell girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_girls "Lowell girls") movement, and other [class struggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle "Class struggle") centered around the various [depressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_\(economics\) "Depression (economics)") of the 19th century. He describes the abuse of government power by corporations and the efforts by workers to resist those abuses.[^18] [^19]

Chapter 11, "Robber Barons and Rebels" covers the rise of industrial corporations such as the railroads and banks and their transformation into the nation's dominant institutions, with corruption resulting in both industry and government. Also covered are the popular movements and individuals that opposed corruption, such as the [Knights of Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Labor "Knights of Labor"), [Edward Bellamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bellamy "Edward Bellamy"), the [Socialist Labor Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Labor_Party_of_America "Socialist Labor Party of America"), the [Haymarket martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_martyrs "Haymarket martyrs"), the [Homestead strikers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike "Homestead strike"), [Alexander Berkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Berkman "Alexander Berkman"), [Emma Goldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman"), [Eugene V. Debs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs "Eugene V. Debs"), the [American Railway Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Railway_Union "American Railway Union"), the [Farmers' Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_Alliance "Farmers' Alliance"), and the [Populist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populist_Party_\(United_States\) "Populist Party (United States)").

### 20th century

Chapter 12, "The Empire and the People", covers [American imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_imperialism "American imperialism") during the [Spanish–American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War "Spanish–American War") and the [Philippine–American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War "Philippine–American War"), as well as in other lands such as [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Hawaii "Republic of Hawaii"), Guam, and Puerto Rico. The [Teller Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teller_Amendment "Teller Amendment") is discussed. Zinn portrays the wars as racist and imperialist and opposed by large segments of the American people.

Chapter 13, "The Socialist Challenge", covers the rise of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_socialist_movement_in_the_United_States "History of the socialist movement in the United States") and [anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_the_United_States "Anarchism in the United States") as popular political ideologies in the United States. Covered in the chapter are the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") (which Zinn argues provided too exclusive of a union for non-white, female, and unskilled workers; Zinn argues in Chapter 24 that this changes in the 1990s), [Industrial Workers of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "Industrial Workers of the World") (IWW), [Mary Harris "Mother" Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harris_Jones "Mary Harris Jones"), [Joe Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hill_\(activist\) "Joe Hill (activist)"), the Socialist Labor Party, [W. E. B. Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois "W. E. B. Du Bois"), and the [Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Moose_Party "Bull Moose Party") (which Zinn portrays as driven by fear of radicalism).

Chapter 14, "War Is the Health of the State" covers [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the [anti-war movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_World_War_I_in_the_United_States "Opposition to World War I in the United States") that happened during it, which was met with the heavily enforced [Espionage Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917 "Espionage Act of 1917"). Zinn argues that the United States entered the war in order to expand its foreign markets and economic influence.

Chapter 15, "Self-Help in Hard Times" covers the government's campaign to destroy the IWW, and the factors leading to the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). Zinn states that, despite popular belief, the 1920s were not a time of prosperity, and the problems of the Depression were simply the chronic problems of the poor extended to the rest of the society. Also covered is the [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA") 's attempts to help the poor during the Depression. He criticizes some aspects of [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt "Franklin Delano Roosevelt") 's [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal "New Deal"): "From the first, the [NRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration "National Recovery Administration") was dominated by big business and served their interests." [^20] According to Zinn, the New Deal was aimed mainly at stabilizing the economy and "secondly at giving enough help to the lower classes to keep them from turning a rebellion into a real revolution".[^21]

Chapter 16, "A People's War?", covers [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), opposition to it, and the effects of the war on the people. Zinn, a veteran of the war himself, notes that "it was the most popular war the US ever fought",[^22] but states that this support may have been manufactured through the institutions of American society. He cites various instances of opposition to fighting (in some cases greater than those during World War I) as proof. Zinn also argues that the US's true intention was not fighting against systematic racism, since the US had this itself, such as with the [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws "Jim Crow laws") (leading to opposition to the war from African-Americans). In accordance with American [revisionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Cold_War "Historiography of the Cold War") historian [Gar Alperovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar_Alperovitz "Gar Alperovitz"), another argument made by Zinn is that the [atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") were not necessary, as the U.S. government had already known that the Japanese were considering surrender beforehand, and it was "most anxious to get the Japanese affair over with before the Russians got in".[^23] Other subjects from WWII covered include [Japanese American internment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment "Japanese American internment") and the [bombing of Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II "Bombing of Dresden in World War II"). The chapter continues into the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), which Zinn writes was used by the U.S. government to increase control over the American people (for instance, eliminating such radical elements as the Communist Party) and at the same time create a state of permanent war, which allowed for the creation of the [military–industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex "Military–industrial complex"). Zinn believes this was possible because both conservatives and liberals willingly worked together in the name of [anti-Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Communism "Anti-Communism"). Also covered is US involvement in the [Greek Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War "Greek Civil War"), the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War"), [Julius and Ethel Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg "Julius and Ethel Rosenberg"), the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan "Marshall Plan") and the [Cuban Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution "Cuban Revolution").

Chapter 17, " 'Or Does It Explode?' " (named after a line from [Langston Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes "Langston Hughes") 's poem "Harlem" from " [Montage of a Dream Deferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_of_a_Dream_Deferred "Montage of a Dream Deferred") ", referred to as "Lenox Avenue Mural" by Zinn), covers the [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement "Civil Rights Movement"). Zinn argues that the government began making reforms against discrimination (although without making fundamental changes) for the sake of changing its international image, but often did not enforce the laws that it passed. Zinn also argues that while nonviolent tactics may have been required for Southern civil rights activists, militant actions (such as those proposed by [Malcolm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X "Malcolm X")) were needed to solve the problems of black [ghettos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto "Ghetto"). Also covered is the involvement of the Communist Party in the movement, the [Congress of Racial Equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality "Congress of Racial Equality"), the [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee"), the [Freedom Riders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Riders "Freedom Riders"), [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO "COINTELPRO"), and the [Black Panther Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party "Black Panther Party").

Chapter 18, "The Impossible Victory: Vietnam", covers the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War") and [resistance to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War "Opposition to the Vietnam War"). Zinn argues that America was fighting a war that it could not win, as the [Vietnamese people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people "Vietnamese people") were in favor of the government of [Ho Chi Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh "Ho Chi Minh") and opposed the regime of [Ngo Dinh Diem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngo_Dinh_Diem "Ngo Dinh Diem"), thus allowing them to keep morale high. Meanwhile, the American military's morale was very low, as many soldiers were put off by the atrocities which they were made to take part in, such as the [My Lai massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_massacre "My Lai massacre"). Zinn also tries to dispel the popular belief that opposition to the war was mainly among college students and middle-class intellectuals, using statistics from the era to show higher opposition from the working class. Zinn argues that the troops themselves also opposed the war, citing desertions and refusals to go to war, as well as movements such as [Vietnam Veterans Against the War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War "Vietnam Veterans Against the War"). Also covered is the US invasions of Laos and Cambodia, [Agent Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange "Agent Orange"), the [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers "Pentagon Papers"), [Ron Kovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Kovic "Ron Kovic"), and raids on draft boards.

Chapter 19, "Surprises", covers other movements that happened during the 1960s, such as [second-wave feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism "Second-wave feminism"), the [prison reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_reform "Prison reform") / [prison abolition movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_abolition_movement "Prison abolition movement"), the [Native American rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_rights_movement "Native American rights movement"), and the [counterculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture "Counterculture"). People and events from the feminist movement covered include [Betty Friedan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Friedan "Betty Friedan") 's *[The Feminine Mystique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feminine_Mystique "The Feminine Mystique")*, [Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_International_Terrorist_Conspiracy_from_Hell "Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell"), [Patricia Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Robinson "Patricia Robinson"), the National Domestic Workers Union, [National Organization for Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women "National Organization for Women"), *[Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade "Roe v.

People and events from the prison movement covered include [George Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Jackson_\(Black_Panther\) "George Jackson (Black Panther)"), the [Attica Prison riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attica_Prison_riots "Attica Prison riots"), and Jerry Sousa.

Chapter 20, "The Seventies: Under Control?", covers political corruption and American disillusion with the government during the 1970s. Zinn argues that the resignation of President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") and the exposure of crimes committed by the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") and [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI") during the decade were done by the government in order to regain support from the American people without making fundamental changes to the system. According to Zinn, [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford "Gerald Ford") 's presidency continued the same basic policies of the [Nixon administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_administration "Nixon administration"). Other topics covered include protests against the [Honeywell Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_Corporation "Honeywell Corporation"), [Angela Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis "Angela Davis"), [Committee to Re-elect the President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_to_Re-elect_the_President "Committee to Re-elect the President"), the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal "Watergate scandal"), [International Telephone and Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telephone_and_Telegraph "International Telephone and Telegraph") 's involvement in the [1973 Chilean coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1973 Chilean coup d'état"), the [Mayagüez incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayag%C3%BCez_incident "Mayagüez incident"), [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra "Project MKUltra"), the [Church Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee "Church Committee"), the [Pike Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Committee "Pike Committee"), the [Trilateral Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_Commission "Trilateral Commission") 's *The Governability of Democracies*, and the People's Bi-Centennial.

Chapter 21, "Carter-Reagan-Bush: The Bipartisan Consensus", covers the [Jimmy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter "Jimmy Carter"), [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"), and [George H. W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush "George H. W. Bush") administrations and their effects on both the American people and foreign countries. Zinn argues that the Democratic and Republican parties keep the government essentially the same, maintaining policies favorable for corporations and a militant foreign policy, no matter which party was in power. Zinn uses similarities among the three administrations' methods to argue for this. Other topics covered include the [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine "Fairness Doctrine"), the [Indonesian invasion of East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor "Indonesian invasion of East Timor"), [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky"), [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), [Roy Benavidez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Benavidez "Roy Benavidez"), the [Trident submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio-class_submarine "Ohio-class submarine"), the [Star Wars program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative "Strategic Defense Initiative"), the [Sandinista National Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista_National_Liberation_Front "Sandinista National Liberation Front"), the [Iran–Contra affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair "Iran–Contra affair"), the [War Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution "War Powers Resolution"), U.S. invasion of Lebanon during the [Lebanese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War "Lebanese Civil War"), the [Invasion of Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada "Invasion of Grenada"), [Óscar Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Romero "Óscar Romero"), the [El Mozote massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre "El Mozote massacre"), the [1986 Bombing of Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Bombing_of_Libya "1986 Bombing of Libya"), the [collapse of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_\(1985%E2%80%931991\)#Dissolution_of_the_USSR "History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)"), the [United States invasion of Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama "United States invasion of Panama"), and the [Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War "Gulf War").

Chapter 22, "The Unreported Resistance", covers several movements that happened during the Carter-Reagan-Bush years that were ignored by much of the mainstream media. Topics covered include the [anti-nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear "Anti-nuclear") movement, the [Plowshares Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plowshares_Movement "Plowshares Movement"), the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, the [Physicians for Social Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians_for_Social_Responsibility "Physicians for Social Responsibility"), [George Kistiakowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kistiakowsky "George Kistiakowsky"), *[The Fate of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fate_of_the_Earth "The Fate of the Earth")*, [Marian Wright Edelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Wright_Edelman "Marian Wright Edelman"), the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, the [Three Mile Island accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident "Three Mile Island accident"), the [Winooski 44](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winooski_44 "Winooski 44"), [Abbie Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbie_Hoffman "Abbie Hoffman"), [Amy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Carter "Amy Carter"), the Piedmont Peace Project, [Anne Braden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Braden "Anne Braden"), [César Chávez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Ch%C3%A1vez "César Chávez"), the [United Farm Workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Farm_Workers "United Farm Workers"), the [Farm Labor Organizing Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Labor_Organizing_Committee "Farm Labor Organizing Committee"), [Teatro Campesino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Campesino "Teatro Campesino"), [LGBT social movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements "LGBT social movements"), the [Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots "Stonewall riots"), [Food Not Bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Not_Bombs "Food Not Bombs"), the [anti-war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war "Anti-war") movement during the Gulf War, [David Barsamian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Barsamian "David Barsamian"), opposition to [Columbus Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day "Columbus Day"), *Indigenous Thought*, *Rethinking Schools*, and the [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990 "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990").

Chapter 23, "The Coming Revolt of the Guards", covers Zinn's theory on a possible future radical movement against inequality in America. Zinn argues that there will eventually be a movement made up not only of groups previously involved in radical change (such as labor organizers, black radicals, Native Americans, feminists), but also members of the middle class who are starting to become discontented with the state of the nation. Zinn expects this movement to use "demonstrations, marches, [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience "Civil disobedience"); strikes and boycotts and [general strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike "General strike"); [direct action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action "Direct action") to redistribute wealth, to reconstruct institutions, to revamp relationships".[^24]

Chapter 24, "The Clinton Presidency", covers the effects of the [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton") administration on the U.S. and the world. Zinn argues that despite Clinton's claims that he would bring change, his presidency kept many things the same. Topics covered include [Jocelyn Elders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Elders "Jocelyn Elders"), the [Waco siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege "Waco siege"), the [Oklahoma City bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing "Oklahoma City bombing"), the [Crime Bill of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act"), the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996 "Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996"), the [Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Reconciliation_Act_of_1996 "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996"), the [1993 bombing of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile_strikes_on_Iraq_\(June_1993\) "Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (June 1993)"), [Operation Gothic Serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gothic_Serpent "Operation Gothic Serpent"), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide "Rwandan genocide"), the [War in Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "War in Bosnia and Herzegovina"), the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), the [North American Free Trade Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement "North American Free Trade Agreement"), the [1998 bombing of Afghanistan and Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Infinite_Reach "Operation Infinite Reach"), the [1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia "NATO bombing of Yugoslavia"), the [impeachment of Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton "Impeachment of Bill Clinton"), [Barbara Ehrenreich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Ehrenreich "Barbara Ehrenreich") 's *[Nickel and Dimed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_and_Dimed "Nickel and Dimed")*, [Stand for Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_for_Children "Stand for Children"), [Jesse Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson "Jesse Jackson"), the [Million Man March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Man_March "Million Man March"), [Mumia Abu-Jamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumia_Abu-Jamal "Mumia Abu-Jamal"), [John Sweeney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sweeney_\(labor_leader\) "John Sweeney (labor leader)"), the [Service Employees International Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union "Service Employees International Union"), the [Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Needletrades,_Industrial_and_Textile_Employees "Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees"), the [Worker Rights Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_Rights_Consortium "Worker Rights Consortium"), the [Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_People%27s_Economic_Human_Rights_Campaign "Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign"), the [UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights"), the [Telecommunications Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996 "Telecommunications Act of 1996"), *[Spare Change News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spare_Change_News "Spare Change News")*, the [North American Street Newspaper Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Street_Newspaper_Association "North American Street Newspaper Association"), the [National Coalition for the Homeless](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Coalition_for_the_Homeless&action=edit&redlink=1 "National Coalition for the Homeless (page does not exist)"), [anti-globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-globalization "Anti-globalization"), and [WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO_Ministerial_Conference_of_1999_protest_activity "WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity").

Chapter 25, "The 2000 Election and the 'War On Terrorism ' ", covers the [2000 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election "2000 United States presidential election") and the [War on Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terrorism "War on Terrorism"). Zinn argues that attacks on the U.S. by Arab terrorists (such as the [September 11, 2001 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks "September 11, 2001 attacks")) are not caused by a hatred for our freedom (as claimed by President [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush")), but by grievances with U.S. foreign policies such as "stationing of U.S. troops in [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia")... [sanctions against Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_sanctions "Iraq sanctions") which... had resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children; \[and\] the continued U.S. support of Israel's occupation of land claimed by [Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_\(region\) "Palestine (region)")." [^25] Other topics covered include [Ralph Nader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader "Ralph Nader"), and the [War in Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\(2001%E2%80%93present\) "War in Afghanistan (2001–present)").

## Critical reception

When *A People's History of the United States* was published in 1980, future [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") historian [Eric Foner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Foner "Eric Foner") reviewed it in *The New York Times*:

> Professor Zinn writes with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the leaden prose of academic history, and his text is studded with telling quotations from labor leaders, war resisters and fugitive slaves. There are vivid descriptions of events that are usually ignored, such as the [Great Railroad Strike of 1877](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877 "Great Railroad Strike of 1877") and the brutal suppression of the [Philippine independence movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War "Philippine–American War") at the turn of this century. Professor Zinn's chapter on Vietnam—bringing to life once again the free-fire zones, secret bombings, massacres and cover-ups—should be required reading for a new generation of students now facing conscription. Nonetheless, *A People's History* reflects a deeply pessimistic vision of the American experience... Uprisings are either crushed, deflected or co-opted... Why such movements so often fail to achieve their goals is never adequately explained... The portrayal of these anonymous Americans, moreover, is strangely circumscribed. Blacks, Indians, women, and laborers appear either as rebels or as victims. Less dramatic but more typical lives—people struggling to survive with dignity in difficult circumstances—receive little attention. Nor does Professor Zinn stop to explore the ideologies that inspired the various uprisings he details.

Foner continues by remarking that "history from the bottom up, though necessary as a corrective, is as limited in its own way as history from the top down." What is necessary, Foner asserts, is "an integrated account incorporating [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") and his slaves, [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson") and the Indians, [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson") and the [Wobblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobblies "Wobblies"), in a continuous historical process, in which each group's experience is shaped in large measure by its relation to others." [^26]

Writing in *The New York Times*, columnist [Bob Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Herbert "Bob Herbert") argued that "Mr. Zinn was often taken to task for peeling back the rosy veneer of much of American history to reveal sordid realities that had remained hidden for too long." [^27] Herbert quotes from Zinn's account of the [presidency of Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Andrew_Jackson "Presidency of Andrew Jackson") as an example of what he means.[^27] Also writing for *The New York Times*, columnist Michael Powell praised the text's impact on changing the perspective of modern histories:

> To describe it as a revisionist account is to risk understatement. A conventional historical account held no allure; he concentrated on what he saw as the genocidal depredations of Christopher Columbus, the blood lust of Theodore Roosevelt and the racial failings of [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln"). He also shined an insistent light on the revolutionary struggles of impoverished farmers, feminists, laborers and resisters of slavery and war. Such stories are more often recounted in textbooks today; they were not at the time.[^28]

Writing in *Dissent*, Georgetown University history professor [Michael Kazin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kazin "Michael Kazin") argued that Zinn is too focused on [class conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict "Class conflict"), and wrongly attributes sinister motives to the American political elite. He characterized the book as an overly simplistic narrative of elite villains and oppressed people, with no attempt to understand historical actors in the context of the time in which they lived. Kazin wrote:

> The ironic effect of such portraits of rulers is to rob 'the people' of cultural richness and variety, characteristics that might gain the respect and not just the sympathy of contemporary readers. For Zinn, ordinary Americans seem to live only to fight the rich and haughty and, inevitably, to be fooled by them.[^29]

Kazin argued that *A People's History* fails to explain why the American political-economic model continues to attract millions of minorities, women, workers, and immigrants, or why the socialist and radical political movements Zinn favors have failed to gain widespread support among the American public.

[Sam Wineburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Wineburg "Sam Wineburg"), a professor of history at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University"), criticizes Zinn's use of [leading questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_question "Leading question"), [cherry-picking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry-picking "Cherry-picking") of sources, and presentation of disputable claims as facts. Wineburg used as an example Zinn's claim that [African Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American "African American") had "widespread indifference, even hostility" to the American war effort in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), which was supported by three quotes. According to Wineburg, Zinn drew the quotes from a book by [Lawrence S. Wittner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_S._Wittner "Lawrence S. Wittner"), but omitted evidence from the same pages that African Americans were underrepresented among draft evaders and conscientious objectors. Wineburg argued that the reason for the book's longtime appeal was that it "speaks directly to our inner [Holden Caulfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Caulfield "Holden Caulfield")." [^30]

Writing in *[The Chronicle of Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education "The Chronicle of Higher Education")*, [Christopher Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Phelps "Christopher Phelps"), associate professor of American studies in the School of American and Canadian Studies at the [University of Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham "University of Nottingham") wrote:

> Professional historians have often viewed Zinn's work with exasperation or condescension, and Zinn was no innocent in the dynamic. I stood against the wall for a Zinn talk at the University of Oregon around the time of the 1992 Columbus Quincentenary. Listening to Zinn, one would have thought historians still considered [Samuel Eliot Morison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Eliot_Morison "Samuel Eliot Morison") 's 1955 book on Columbus to be definitive. The crowd lapped it up, but Zinn knew better. He missed a chance to explain how the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s have transformed the writing and teaching of history, how his *People's History* did not spring out of thin air but was an effort to synthesize a widely shared shift in historical sensibilities. Zinn's historical theorizing, conflating objectivity with neutrality and position with bias, was no better. The critics would be churlish, however, not to acknowledge the moving example Zinn set in the civil-rights and Vietnam movements, and they would be remiss not to note the value of *A People's History*, along with its limitations. Zinn told tales well, stories that, while familiar to historians, often remained unknown to wider publics. He challenged national pieties and encouraged critical reflection about received wisdom. He understood that America's various radicalisms, far from being "un-American," have propelled the nation toward more humane and democratic arrangements. And he sold two-million copies of a work of history in a culture that is increasingly unwilling to read and, consequently, unable to imagine its past very well.[^31]

In *The New York Times Book Review* in a review of *A Young People's History of the United States*, volumes 1 and 2, novelist [Walter Kirn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kirn "Walter Kirn") wrote:

> That America is not a better place—that it finds itself almost globally despised, mired in war, self-doubt and random violence—is also a fact, of course, but not one that Zinn's brand of history seems equal to. His stick-figure pageant of capitalist cupidity can account, in its fashion, for terrorism—as when, in the second volume, subtitled "Class Struggle to the War on Terror," he notes that Sept. 11 was an assault on "symbols of American wealth and power"—but it doesn't address the themes of religious zealotry, technological change and cultural confusion that animate what I was taught in high school to label "current events" but that contemporary students may as well just call "the weirdness." The line from Columbus to [Columbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_shooting "Columbine shooting"), from the first [Independence Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_\(United_States\) "Independence Day (United States)") to the Internet, and from the [Boston Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party "Boston Tea Party") to [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad") is a wandering line, not a party line. As for the "new possibilities" it points to, I can't see them clearly.[^7]

Professors [Michael Kazin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kazin "Michael Kazin"), [Michael Kammen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kammen "Michael Kammen") and [Mary Grabar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mary_Grabar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mary Grabar (page does not exist)") condemn the book as a black-and-white story of elite villains and oppressed victims, a story that robs American history of its depth and intricacy and leaves nothing but an empty text simplified to the level of propaganda.[^29] [^32] [^33]

A version of the book titled *The Twentieth Century* contains only chapters 12–25 ("The Empire and the People" to "The 2000 Election and the 'War on Terrorism ' "). Although it was originally meant to be an expansion of the original book, recent editions of *A People's History* now contain all of the later chapters from it. In 2004, Zinn and Anthony Arnove published a collection of more than 200 primary source documents titled *Voices of a People's History of the United States*, available both as a book and as a CD of dramatic readings. Writer Aaron Sarver notes that although Kazin "savaged" Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*, "one of the few concessions Kazin made was his approval of Zinn punctuating 'his narrative with hundreds of quotes from slaves and [Populists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism "Populism"), anonymous wage-earners and... articulate radicals ' ".[^34]

Sarver argued that, whether Zinn intended it or not, *Voices* served as a useful response to Kazin's critique. " *Voices* is a vast anthology that tells heartbreaking and uplifting stories of American history. Kazin will be hard-pressed to charge Zinn with politicizing the intelligence here; the volume offers only Zinn's sparse introductions to each piece, letting the actors and their words speak for themselves." [^34] In 2008, Zinn worked with [Mike Konopacki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Konopacki "Mike Konopacki") and [Paul Buhle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buhle "Paul Buhle") on creating *[A People's History of American Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_American_Empire "A People's History of American Empire")*, a [graphic novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel "Graphic novel") that covers various historic subjects drawn from *A People's History of the United States* as well as Zinn's own history of his involvement in activism and historic events as covered in his autobiography *You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train*. Zinn worked as the editor for a series of books under the *A People's History* label. This series expands upon the issues and historic events covered in *A People's History of the United States* by giving them in-depth coverage, and also covers the history of parts of the world outside the United States. These books include:

The third of a series of five books which reconstruct U.S. history from marginalized peoples' perspectives.[^37]

In July 2007 Seven Stories Press released *A Young People's History of the United States*, an illustrated, two-volume adaptation of *A People's History* for young adult readers (ages 10–14). The new version, adapted from the original text by Rebecca Stefoff, is updated through the end of 2006, and includes a new introduction and afterword by Zinn. In his introduction, Zinn writes, "It seems to me it is wrong to treat young readers as if they are not mature enough to look at their nation's policies honestly. I am not worried about disillusioning young people by pointing to the flaws in the traditional heroes." In the afterword, "Rise like lions", he asks young readers to "Imagine the American people united for the first time in a movement for fundamental change." In addition, the New Press released an updated (2007) version of *The Wall Charts* for *A People's History* —a 2-piece fold-out poster featuring an illustrated timeline of U.S. history, with an explanatory booklet.

In 2008, the Zinn Education Project was launched to promote and support the use of *A People's History of the United States* (and other materials) for teaching in middle and high school classrooms across the U.S. The goal of the project is to give American students Zinn's version of U.S. history.[^38] With funds from an anonymous donor who had been a student of Zinn's, the project began by distributing 4,000 packets to teachers in all states and territories. The project now offers teaching guides and bibliographies that can be freely downloaded.[^39]

Mr. Zinn, delighted in... lancing what he considered platitudes, not the least that American history was a heroic march toward democracy... 'Our nation had gone through an awful lot—the Vietnam War, civil rights, Watergate—yet the textbooks offered the same fundamental nationalist glorification of country,' Mr. Zinn recalled in an interview with *The New York Times*.
