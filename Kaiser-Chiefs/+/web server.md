A [[program]] that acts as a web server, serving content based on sent requests and its own configuration.
These types of servers typically only support [[HTTP request]]s.
Examples include: [[Nginx]], [[Apache]], [[Lighttpd]], [[traefik]].

The webserver can serve as a simple content provider, simply serving static content like [[HTML]] or images, but it can also be configured to do more complex things such as pass requests to other [[web application]]s based on the configured rules.
