The **1936 Summer Olympics** ([German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): *Olympische Sommerspiele 1936*), officially the **Games of the XI Olympiad** ([German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): *Spiele der XI. Olympiade*) and officially branded as **Berlin 1936**, were an international [multi-sport event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-sport_event "Multi-sport event") held from 1 to 16 August 1936 in [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin"), then capital of [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"). Berlin won the bid to host the Games over [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona") on the 29th [IOC Session](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC_Session "IOC Session") on 26 April 1931. The 1936 Games marked the second and most recent time the [International Olympic Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee") gathered to vote in a city bidding to host those Games. Later rule modifications forbade cities hosting the bid vote from being awarded the games.

To outdo the [1932 Los Angeles Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Summer_Olympics "1932 Summer Olympics"), *Reichskanzler* [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") had [a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_\(Berlin\) "Olympiastadion (Berlin)") built, as well as six gymnasiums and other smaller arenas. The Games were the first to be [televised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehsender_Paul_Nipkow "Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow"), with radio broadcasts reaching 41 countries.[^3] Filmmaker [Leni Riefenstahl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl "Leni Riefenstahl") was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million.[^3] Her film, titled *[Olympia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_\(1938_film\) "Olympia (1938 film)")*, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports.

Hitler saw the 1936 Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and [antisemitism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism"), and the official [Nazi Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party "Nazi Party") paper, the *[Völkischer Beobachter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkischer_Beobachter "Völkischer Beobachter")*, wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games.[^4] [^5] German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part in the Games by a variety of methods,[^6] although some female swimmers from the Jewish sports club [Hakoah Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakoah_Vienna "Hakoah Vienna") did participate. Jewish athletes from other countries were said to have been sidelined to avoid offending the Nazi regime.[^7] [Lithuania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania "Lithuania") was expelled from the Olympic Games due to Berlin's position regarding Lithuanian anti-Nazi policy, particularly because of the 1934–35 [Trial of Neumann and Sass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Neumann_and_Sass "Trial of Neumann and Sass") in Klaipėda.[^8]

Total ticket revenues were 7.5million [Reichsmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Reichsmark "German Reichsmark") (equivalent to €17.4 million in 2021), for a profit of over one million ℛ︁ℳ︁. The official budget did not include [outlays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlay "Outlay") by the city of Berlin (which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5million R.M.) or the outlays of the German national government (which did not make its costs public, but is estimated to have spent US $30million).[^9]

[Jesse Owens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens "Jesse Owens") of the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "United States at the 1936 Summer Olympics") won four gold medals in the sprint and [long jump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump "Long jump") events, and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin, while [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Germany at the 1936 Summer Olympics") was [the most successful country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics_medal_table "1936 Summer Olympics medal table") overall with 101 medals (38 of them gold); the United States placed a distant second with 57 medals.[^10] These were the final Olympic Games under the presidency of [Henri de Baillet-Latour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Baillet-Latour "Henri de Baillet-Latour"). For the next 12 years, no Olympic Games were held due to the immense world disruption caused by the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). The next Olympic Games were held in 1948 (the [Winter Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Winter_Olympics "1948 Winter Olympics") in [St. Moritz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Moritz "St. Moritz"), Switzerland, and then the [Summer Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Summer_Olympics "1948 Summer Olympics") in [London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London"), England).

## Host city selection

At the 28th [IOC Session](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC_Session "IOC Session"), held in May 1930 in Berlin, 14 cities announced their intention to bid to host the 1936 Summer Olympic Games.[^12] By the time of the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona in April 1931, only Barcelona and Berlin were left in contention. The other cities that announced an intention to hold the games, but withdrew from the race, were [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), [Budapest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest"), [Buenos Aires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires"), [Cologne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne "Cologne"), [Dublin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin "Dublin"), [Frankfurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt "Frankfurt"), [Helsinki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki "Helsinki"), [Lausanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne "Lausanne"), [Montevideo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo"), [Nuremberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg "Nuremberg"), [Rio de Janeiro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro "Rio de Janeiro"), and [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome").[^12] Helsinki, Rome, Barcelona, and Rio de Janeiro would go on to host the Olympic Games in 1952, 1960, 1992, and 2016, respectively.[^11] Rome withdrew on the eve of the 1931 Session.

The city of Barcelona held a multi-sport festival at the same time as the 1931 IOC Session. This included a football match between [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team "Spain national football team") and the [Irish Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team "Republic of Ireland national football team"), which was watched by 50,000 spectators. The political uncertainty around the declaration of the [Second Spanish Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic "Second Spanish Republic"), which had happened days before the IOC Session, was likely a great factor in the decision taken by delegates regarding the host city for 1936.[^13]

The games were the first for which the host was decided by a vote of each individual [IOC member](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC_members "IOC members").[^14] The deadline for votes was 13 May 1931, two weeks after the Barcelona Session.[^15] Of the 67 voting IOC members, 19 submitted ballots during the Session, and 40 by post to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne; the other 8 abstained. The vote was 43 for Berlin, and 16 for Barcelona.[^15]

After the [Nazis took control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power#Seizure_of_control_\(1931%E2%80%931933\) "Adolf Hitler's rise to power") of Germany and began instituting [anti-Semitic policies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany#Racial_policies_regarding_the_Jews,_1933%E2%80%931939 "Racial policy of Nazi Germany"), the IOC held private discussions among its delegates about changing the decision to hold the Games in Berlin. However, Hitler's regime gave assurances that Jewish athletes would be allowed to compete on a German Olympic team.[^16] One year before the games, the [American Olympic Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_%26_Paralympic_Committee "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee") suggested to change the venue to Rome; they saw Rome as a good replacement because Rome was originally selected to hold the [1908 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908_Summer_Olympics "1908 Summer Olympics").[^17] The proposal was not seriously discussed.

[Hans von Tschammer und Osten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_Tschammer_und_Osten "Hans von Tschammer und Osten"), as *Reichssportführer* (i.e., head of the [National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_League_of_the_Reich_for_Physical_Exercise "National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise") (Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen, DRL), the Reich Sports Office, played a major role in the structure and organisation of the Olympics. He promoted the idea that the use of sports would harden the German spirit and instill unity among German youth. At the same time, he also believed that sports was a "way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables".[^18]

Von Tschammer entrusted the details of the organisation of the games to the president of the German Olympic Committee, [Theodor Lewald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Lewald "Theodor Lewald"),[^19] and [Carl Diem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Diem "Carl Diem"), the former president and secretary of the *Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen*, the forerunner of the Reich Sports Office. Among Diem's ideas for the Berlin Games was the introduction of the [Olympic torch relay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame "Olympic flame") between [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece") and the host nation.[^19] Lewald would be replaced, owing to his paternal grandmother's Jewish roots, by Von Tschammer himself.[^19]

Runners carrying the Olympic Flame

The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the [first of its kind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_torch_relays "List of Olympic torch relays"),[^20] following on from the reintroduction of the [Olympic Flame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Flame "Olympic Flame") at the [1928 Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics "1928 Summer Olympics"). It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue. Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the 1938 film *[Olympia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_\(1938_film\) "Olympia (1938 film)")*.

> The sportive, knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics. It doesn't separate but unites the combatants in understanding and respect. It also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace. That's why the Olympic Flame should never die.
> 
> —  [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), commenting on the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games.[^21]

The games were the first to have [live television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_television "Live television") coverage in black-and-white.[^19] The German Post Office, using equipment from [Telefunken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telefunken "Telefunken"), broadcast over 70 hours of coverage to special viewing rooms throughout Berlin and [Potsdam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam "Potsdam") and a few private TV sets, transmitting from the [Paul Nipkow TV Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehsender_Paul_Nipkow "Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow"). They used three different types of TV cameras, so blackouts would occur when changing from one type to another.[^22] The games were also first time photographed and filmed in color using newly invented [Agfacolor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agfacolor "Agfacolor").[^23]

The 1936 Olympic village was located at Elstal in [Wustermark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wustermark "Wustermark") (at [52°32′10.78″N 13°0′33.20″E / 52.5363278°N 13.0092222°E](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=1936_Summer_Olympics&params=52_32_10.78_N_13_0_33.20_E_scale:8000)), on the western edge of Berlin. The site, which is 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the centre of the city, consisted of one and two-floor dormitories, a large dining hall, *Dining Hall of the Nations*, a swimming facility, a gymnasium, track, and other training facilities. Its layout was designed and construction was overseen by the appointed village commander *[Hauptmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptmann "Hauptmann")* [Wolfgang Fürstner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_F%C3%BCrstner "Wolfgang Fürstner") beginning in 1934.[^24] Less than two months before the start of the Olympic Games, Fürstner was abruptly demoted to vice-commander, and replaced by *[Oberstleutnant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberstleutnant "Oberstleutnant")* [Werner von Gilsa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_von_Gilsa "Werner von Gilsa"), commander of the [Berlin Guard-Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_Regiment_Gro%C3%9Fdeutschland "Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland"). The official reason for the replacement was that Fürstner had not acted "with the necessary energy" to prevent damage to the site as 370,000 visitors passed through it between 1 May and 15 June. However, this was just a cover story to explain the sudden demotion of the half-Jewish officer.[^25] The 1935 [Nuremberg Laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws "Nuremberg Laws"), passed during the period Fürstner was overseeing the Olympic Village, had classified him as a Jew, and as such, the career officer was to be expelled from the *[Wehrmacht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht "Wehrmacht")*.[^26] Two days after the conclusion of the Berlin Olympics, vice-commander Fürstner had been removed from active *Wehrmacht* duty,[^27] and committed suicide a day later because he realised he had no future under the Nazis.[^25]

After the completion of the Olympic Games, the village was repurposed for the *[Wehrmacht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht "Wehrmacht")* into the Olympic Döberitz Hospital ([German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): *Olympia-Lazarett Döberitz*), and Army Infantry School ([German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): *Heeres-Infanterieschule*), and was used as such through the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). In 1945 it was taken over by the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and became a military camp of the Soviet occupation forces. Late 20th-century efforts were made to restore parts of the former village, but little progress was made. More recently, the vast majority of the land of the Olympic Village has been managed by the DKB Foundation, with more success; efforts are being made to restore the site into a living museum. The dormitory building used by [Jesse Owens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens "Jesse Owens"), [Meissen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissen "Meissen") House, has been fully restored, with the gymnasium and swimming hall partially restored. Seasonally, tours are given daily to small groups and students.[^28]

The site remains relatively unknown even in Germany, but some tournaments are held at the site to boost knowledge of the venues.[^29]

Twenty-two venues were used for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Many were located in the [Reich Sportsfeld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiapark_Berlin "Olympiapark Berlin") complex.

Sailing was held in the [Bay of Kiel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Kiel "Bay of Kiel"), which would serve as [the same sporting venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics "Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics") held in [Munich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich").[^30] The Olympic Stadium would later be part of two [FIFA World Cups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") and then host an [IAAF World Championships in Athletics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics "IAAF World Championships in Athletics") along with undergoing a renovation in the early 2000s to give new life to the stadium. [Avus Motor Road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVUS "AVUS") (AVUS) was started in 1907, but was not completed until 1921 due to [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I").[^31] The track was rebuilt for the 1936 Games.[^31] AVUS continued being used after [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") though mainly in [Formula 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_2 "Formula 2") racing.[^31] The [German Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Grand_Prix "German Grand Prix") was last held at the track in 1959.[^31] Dismantling of the track first took place in 1968 to make way for a traffic crossing for touring cars that raced there until 1998.[^31]

BSV 92 Field was first constructed in 1910 for use in football, handball, athletics, and tennis.[^32] The Reich Sports Field, which consisted of the Olympic Stadium, the Dietrich Eckert Open-Air Theatre, the Olympic Swimming Stadium, Mayfield, the Hockey Stadiums, the Tennis Courts, and the Haus des Deutschen Sports, was planned for the aborted [1916 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1916_Summer_Olympics "1916 Summer Olympics"), but was not completed until 1934.[^33] Mayfield was the last venue completed prior to the 1936 Games in April 1936.[^33] Deutschland Hall was opened in 1935.[^34] Mommenstadion opened in 1930.[^35] Basketball was held outdoors at the request of the [International Basketball Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Basketball_Federation "International Basketball Federation") (FIBA).[^36] [^37] The tennis courts were used, which turned to mud during heavy rain at the final.[^36] The [K-1 1000 m](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoeing_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_K-1_1000_metres "Canoeing at the 1936 Summer Olympics – Men's K-1 1000 metres") canoeing final was also affected by heavy rain at Grünau that included thunder and lightning.[^38] During World War II, [Deutschlandhalle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandhalle "Deutschlandhalle") in Berlin, suffered heavy aerial bombing damage.[^34] After the war, the hall was reconstructed and expanded.[^34] The [Deutschlandhalle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandhalle "Deutschlandhalle") was used as a venue, but was increasingly closed for repairs, last in 2009. It was demolished in December 2011. The [Mommsenstadion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mommsenstadion "Mommsenstadion") was renovated in 1987 and was still in use as of 2010.[^35]

The Olympic Stadium was used as an underground [bunker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker "Bunker") in World War II as the war went against [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") 's favor.[^39] The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s.[^40] As a host venue for the [1974 FIFA World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_FIFA_World_Cup "1974 FIFA World Cup"), the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands.[^41] British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994.[^42] Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000.[^43] This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004.[^44] The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004,[^45] with a capacity of 74,228 people. The seating has been changed greatly, especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders. The stadium now plays host to [Hertha BSC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertha_BSC "Hertha BSC") (1963–present), and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come. For the [2006 FIFA World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup"), the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France.[^46] Three years later, the venue hosted the [World Athletics Championships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_World_Championships_in_Athletics "2009 World Championships in Athletics").[^47]

Parade of nations

The opening ceremony was held at the [Berlin Olympic Stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_\(Berlin\) "Olympiastadion (Berlin)") on 1 August 1936. A flyover by the German airship *[Hindenburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_129_Hindenburg "LZ 129 Hindenburg")* flying the Olympic flag behind it was featured early in the opening ceremonies.[^63] After the arrival of Hitler and his entourage, the parade of nations proceeded, each nation with its own unique costume. As the birthplace of the Olympics, Greece entered the stadium first. The host nation, Germany, entered last. Some nations' athletes purposefully gave the [Nazi salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute "Nazi salute") as they passed Hitler. Others gave the [Olympic salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_salute "Olympic salute") (a similar one, given with the same arm), or a different gesture entirely, such as hats-over-hearts, as the United States, India,[^64] and China did. All nations lowered their flags as they passed the Führer, save the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the [Commonwealth of the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines "Commonwealth of the Philippines"). (The United States doing this was explained later as an army regulation, and the country traditionally avoids dipping its flag at the Olympics.[^65] [^63]) Writer [Thomas Wolfe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe "Thomas Wolfe"), who was there, described the opening as an "almost religious event, the crowd screaming, swaying in unison and begging for Hitler. There was something scary about it; his cult of personality." [^66]

[Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") and [Henri de Baillet-Latour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Baillet-Latour "Henri de Baillet-Latour") enter the Olympic Stadium

After a speech by the president of the German Olympic Committee, the games were officially declared open by Adolf Hitler who quoted (in German): "I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Berlin, celebrating the Eleventh Olympiad of the modern era." [^63] This sentence was written by IOC President Baillet-Latour as part of a compromise the IOC struck to prevent Hitler from turning the speech into a propaganda event, and he was to follow it strictly, to which Hitler reportedly joked "Count, I'll take the trouble to learn it by heart".[^67] Hitler opened the games from his own box, on top of others. Writer [David Wallechinsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wallechinsky "David Wallechinsky") has commented on the event, saying, "This was his event, he wanted to be glorified." [^66]

Although the [Olympic flame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame "Olympic flame") was first introduced in the [1928 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics "1928 Summer Olympics") in Amsterdam, this was the first instance of the torch relay. The Germans invented the concept of the torch run from ancient [Olympia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Greece "Olympia, Greece") to the host city. Thus as swimmer [Iris Cummings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_Cummings "Iris Cummings") later related, "once the athletes were all in place, the torch bearer ran in through the tunnel to go around the stadium". A young man chosen for this task ran up the steps all the way up to the top of the stadium there to light a cauldron which would start this eternal flame that would burn through the duration of the games.[^66] [^68]

But despite all the pomp and ceremony, and the glorification of Hitler, all did not go according to plan, and there was a rather humorous aspect in the opening ceremony. U.S. [distance runner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_runner "Distance runner") [Louis Zamperini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Zamperini "Louis Zamperini"), one of the athletes present, related it on camera:[^66]

> They released 25,000 pigeons, the sky was clouded with pigeons, the pigeons circled overhead, and then they shot a cannon, and they scared the poop out of the pigeons, and we had straw hats, flat straw hats, and you could heard the pitter-patter on our straw hats, but we felt sorry for the women, for they got it in their hair, but I mean there were a mass of droppings, and I say it was so funny...

Basketball, canoeing, and [handball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_handball "Team handball") made their debut at the Olympics. Handball did not appear again on the program until the next German summer Olympic games in [Munich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich") in [1972](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics "1972 Summer Olympics"). There were two [demonstration sports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_sports "Demonstration sports"): [baseball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Baseball at the 1936 Summer Olympics") and [gliding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Gliding at the 1936 Summer Olympics").[^69] [Art competitions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_competitions_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Art competitions at the 1936 Summer Olympics") for medals were also held, and medals were awarded at the closing ceremony for feats of [alpinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpinism_at_the_Olympic_Games "Alpinism at the Olympic Games") and [aeronautics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Aeronautics at the 1936 Summer Olympics").[^70] Unofficial exhibition events included [Indian sports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_sports_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Indian sports at the 1936 Summer Olympics"),[^71] [^72] [wushu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wushu_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Wushu at the 1936 Summer Olympics") [^73] and [motor racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Rally "Olympic Rally").[^74]

Germany had a successful year in [the equestrian events](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics "Equestrian at the 1936 Summer Olympics"), winning individual and team gold in all three disciplines, as well as individual silver in dressage. In the cycling match sprint finals, German [Toni Merkens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Merkens "Toni Merkens") fouled [Arie van Vliet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arie_van_Vliet "Arie van Vliet") of the Netherlands. Instead of being disqualified, he was fined 100 ℛℳ and kept his gold. German gymnasts [Konrad Frey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Frey "Konrad Frey") and [Alfred Schwarzmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Schwarzmann "Alfred Schwarzmann") both won three gold medals.

American [Jesse Owens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens "Jesse Owens") won four gold medals in the sprint and [long jump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump "Long jump") events. His German competitor [Luz Long](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_Long "Luz Long") offered Owens advice after he almost failed to qualify in the long jump. [Mack Robinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Robinson_\(athlete\) "Mack Robinson (athlete)"), brother of [Jackie Robinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Robinson "Jackie Robinson"), won the 200-meter sprint silver medal behind Owens by 0.4 seconds. Although he did not win a medal, future American war hero [Louis Zamperini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Zamperini "Louis Zamperini"), lagging behind in the 5,000-meter final, made up ground by clocking a 56-second final lap. In one of the most dramatic [800-meter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres "800 metres") races in history, American [John Woodruff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woodruff_\(athlete\) "John Woodruff (athlete)") won gold after slowing to jogging speed in the middle of the final to free himself from being boxed in.[^75] [Glenn Edgar Morris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Morris "Glenn Morris"), a farm boy from Colorado, won gold in the decathlon. British [rower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_rowing "Sport rowing") [Jack Beresford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Beresford "Jack Beresford") won his fifth Olympic medal in the sport, and his third gold medal. The U.S. eight-man rowing team from the [University of Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington "University of Washington") won the gold medal, coming from behind to defeat the Germans and Italians with Hitler in attendance. 13-year-old American sensation [Marjorie Gestring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Gestring "Marjorie Gestring") won the [women's 3 meter diving event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_3_metre_springboard "Diving at the 1936 Summer Olympics – Women's 3 metre springboard").[^76]

[John Woodruff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woodruff_\(athlete\) "John Woodruff (athlete)") 's gold medal for winning the [800 metres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_800_metres "Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics – Men's 800 metres"), on display at [Hillman Library](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillman_Library "Hillman Library"), [University of Pittsburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh "University of Pittsburgh"), [Pittsburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh"), [PA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania"), U.S.

[Jack Lovelock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lovelock "Jack Lovelock") of New Zealand won the 1500 m gold medal, coming through a strong field to win in the world record time of 3:47.8.

In the [marathon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_\(sport\) "Marathon (sport)"), the [ethnic Koreans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_people "Korean people") [Sohn Kee-chung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohn_Kee-chung "Sohn Kee-chung") and [Nam Sung-yong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_Sung-yong "Nam Sung-yong") won one gold and one bronze medal; as Korea was annexed by Japan at the time, they were running for Japan.

[India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") won the gold medal in the [field hockey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey "Field hockey") event once again (they won the gold in all Olympics from 1928 to 1956), defeating Germany 8–1 in the final. Indians were considered [Indo-Aryans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryans "Indo-Aryans") by the German authorities and there was no controversy regarding the victory.

[Rie Mastenbroek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rie_Mastenbroek "Rie Mastenbroek") of the [Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") won three gold medals and a silver in swimming. [Estonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonians "Estonians") heavyweight [wrestler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling "Wrestling") [Kristjan Palusalu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Palusalu "Kristjan Palusalu") won two gold medals, and he became the first and only wrestler in Olympic history ever to win both the Greco-Roman and freestyle heavyweight events. Berlin 1936 marked the last time [Estonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia "Estonia") [competed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia_at_the_Olympics "Estonia at the Olympics") as an independent nation in the Olympics until 1992.

After winning the middleweight class, the [Egyptian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_people "Egyptian people") weightlifter [Khadr El Touni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadr_El_Touni "Khadr El Touni") continued to compete for another 45 minutes, finally exceeding the total of the German silver medalist by 35 kg. The 20-year-old El Touni lifted a total of 387.5 kg, crushing two German world champions and breaking the then-Olympic and world records, while the German lifted 352.5 kg. Furthermore, El Touni had lifted 15 kg more than the light-heavyweight gold medalist, a feat only El Touni has accomplished. El Touni's new world records stood for 13 years. Fascinated by El Touni's performance, Adolf Hitler rushed down to greet this human miracle. Prior to the competition, Hitler was said to have been sure that [Rudolf Ismayr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Ismayr "Rudolf Ismayr") and Adolf Wagner would embarrass all other opponents. Hitler was so impressed by El Touni's domination in the middleweight class that he ordered a street named after him in Berlin's Olympic village. The Egyptian held the No. 1 position on the [IWF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Weightlifting_Federation "International Weightlifting Federation") list of history's 50 greatest weightlifters for 60 years, until the [1996 Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics "1996 Summer Olympics") in [Atlanta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta") where [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") 's [Naim Süleymanoğlu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naim_S%C3%BCleymano%C4%9Flu "Naim Süleymanoğlu") surpassed him to top the list.

[Italy's football team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team "Italy national football team") continued their dominance under head coach [Vittorio Pozzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Pozzo "Vittorio Pozzo"), winning the gold medal in these Olympics between their two consecutive [World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") victories ([1934](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_FIFA_World_Cup "1934 FIFA World Cup") and [1938](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_FIFA_World_Cup "1938 FIFA World Cup")). Much like the successes of German athletes, this triumph was claimed by supporters of [Benito Mussolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") 's regime as a vindication of the superiority of the fascist system. Austria won the silver; a controversial win after Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount [Peru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru") 's 4–2 win over [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_State_of_Austria "Federal State of Austria"). The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games. In the quarter-finals of the [football](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football") tournament, Peru beat Austria 4–2 in extra-time. Peru rallied from a two-goal deficit in the final 15 minutes of normal time. During extra-time, Peruvian fans allegedly ran onto the field and attacked an Austrian player. In the chaos, Peru scored twice and won, 4–2. However, Austria protested and the International Olympic Committee ordered a replay without any spectators. The Peruvian government refused and their entire Olympic squad left in protest as did Colombia.[^77]

A remarkable story from the track and field competition was the gold medal won by the US women's 4 × 100 m relay team. The German team were the heavy favourites, but dropped the baton at one hand-off. Of notable interest on the US team was [Betty Robinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Robinson "Betty Robinson").[^78] She was the first woman ever awarded an Olympic gold medal for track and field, winning the women's 100 m event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.[^78] In 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash, and was severely injured. Her body was discovered in the wreckage and it was wrongly thought that she was dead. She was placed in the trunk of a car and taken to an undertaker, where it was discovered that she was not dead, but in a coma. She awoke from the coma seven months later, although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again.[^79] Due to the length of her recovery, she had to miss participating in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, in her home country.

A total of 49 nations attended the Berlin Olympics, up from 37 in [1932](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Summer_Olympics "1932 Summer Olympics"). Five nations made their first official Olympic appearance at these Games: [Afghanistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan"), [Bermuda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda "Bermuda"), [Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia"), [Costa Rica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica") and [Liechtenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein "Liechtenstein").

Historical sign, 'Jews Not Welcome', Germany, 1933–39, Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin. Such signs were removed for the Olympics.

Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of Aryan racial supremacy. The official Nazi party paper, the *[Völkischer Beobachter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkischer_Beobachter "Völkischer Beobachter")*, wrote in the strongest terms that Jewish and black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games.[^4] [^5] However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed black and Jewish people to participate, and added one token participant to the German team— [Helene Mayer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Mayer "Helene Mayer"), a woman of Jewish descent. Hitler was an adroit player of sexual affairs and he used his liaison with [Unity Mitford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Mitford "Unity Mitford") to good advantage in the public sphere, for example when he gave her a private Olympic stadium box, to which she invited her connections in British high society.[^85] In an attempt to "clean up" the host city,[^19] the [German Ministry of the Interior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior_\(Germany\) "Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)") authorized the chief of police to arrest all [Romani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") and keep them in a "special camp", the [Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin-Marzahn_concentration_camp "Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp").[^86] The 'Jews Not Welcome' signs were removed for the duration of the Olympics.[^19]

A 1935 political cartoon by Jewish British artist John Henry Amshewitz; Nazi sportsmen trample the Olympic spirit while marching past a concentration camp holding, among others, Jews and a "non-political sportsman". The axe of "Nazi justice" chops away at the tree of sport.

[American Olympic Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_%26_Paralympic_Committee "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee") president [Avery Brundage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brundage "Avery Brundage") became a main supporter of the Games being held in Germany, arguing that "politics has no place in sport", despite having initial doubts.[^87]

French Olympians gave a [Roman salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute "Roman salute") at the opening ceremony: known as the *salut de Joinville* per the battalion, [Bataillon de Joinville](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataillon_de_Joinville "fr:Bataillon de Joinville"), the [Olympic salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_salute "Olympic salute") was part of the Olympic traditions since the 1924 games.[^88] However, due to the different context this action was mistaken by the crowd for a support to fascism, and the [Olympic salute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_salute "Olympic salute") was discarded after 1946.[^89]

Although [Haiti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti "Haiti") attended only the opening ceremony, an interesting [vexillological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology "Vexillology") fact was noticed: [its flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Haiti "Flag of Haiti") and the [flag of Liechtenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Liechtenstein "Flag of Liechtenstein") were coincidentally identical, and this was not discovered until then. The following year, a crown was added to Liechtenstein's to distinguish one flag from the other.[^90]

[Marty Glickman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Glickman "Marty Glickman") and [Sam Stoller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Stoller "Sam Stoller") were originally slated to compete in the American 4x100 relay team but were replaced by [Jesse Owens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens "Jesse Owens") and [Ralph Metcalfe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Metcalfe "Ralph Metcalfe") prior to the start of the race. There were speculations that their Jewish heritage contributed to the decision "not to embarrass the German hosts"; however, given that African-Americans were also heavily disliked by the Nazis, Glickman and Stoller's replacement with black American athletes does not support this theory. Others said that they were in a better physical condition, and that was the main reason behind the replacement.[^91]

The German Olympic Committee, in accordance with Nazi directives, virtually barred Germans who were Jewish or [Roma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") or had such an ancestry from participating in the Games ([Helene Mayer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Mayer "Helene Mayer"), who had one Jewish parent, was the only German Jew to compete at the Berlin Games). This decision meant exclusion for many of the country's top athletes such as [shotputter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotputter "Shotputter") and [discus thrower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discus_thrower "Discus thrower") [Lilli Henoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilli_Henoch "Lilli Henoch"), who was a four-time world record holder and 10-time German national champion,[^92] and [Gretel Bergmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretel_Bergmann "Gretel Bergmann") who was suspended from the German team just days after she set a record of 1.60 meters in the high jump.[^93] [^94] [Daniel Prenn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Prenn "Daniel Prenn"), [Erich Seelig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Seelig "Erich Seelig") and [Johann Trollmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Trollmann "Johann Trollmann") were also excluded.[^19]

Prior to and during the Games, there was considerable debate outside Germany over whether the competition should be allowed or discontinued. Berlin had been selected by the IOC as the host city in 1931 during the [Weimar Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic"), but after [Adolf Hitler's rise to power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power "Adolf Hitler's rise to power") in 1933, observers in many countries began to question the morality of going ahead with an Olympic Games hosted by the Nazi regime. A number of brief campaigns to boycott or relocate the Games emerged in the [United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Republic_of_France "Third Republic of France"), [Sweden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), [Czechoslovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Republic_of_Czechoslovakia "First Republic of Czechoslovakia"), the [Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands"), and the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States").[^95] Exiled German political opponents of Hitler's regime also campaigned against the Berlin Olympics through pro-Communist newspapers such as the *[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung "Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung")*.

The protests were ultimately unsuccessful; forty-nine teams from around the world participated in the 1936 Games, the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point.[^95]

Fencer [Albert Wolff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Wolff_\(fencer\) "Albert Wolff (fencer)") qualified for the French Olympic Team but boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics, withdrawing from France's national team on principle because he was Jewish.[^96] He said: "I cannot participate in anything sponsored by Adolf Hitler, even for France." [^97]

Individual Jewish athletes from several countries chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics, including South African [Sid Kiel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Kiel "Sid Kiel").[^98]

The [Spanish government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic "Second Spanish Republic") led by the newly elected left-wing [Popular Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_\(Spain\) "Popular Front (Spain)") boycotted the Games and organized the [People's Olympiad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Olympiad "People's Olympiad") as a parallel event in [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"). Some 6,000 athletes [^99] from 49 countries registered.[^100] However, the People's Olympiad was aborted because of the outbreak of the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") just one day before the event was due to start.[^95]

The [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") had not participated in international sporting events since the [1920 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics "1920 Summer Olympics"). The Soviet government was not invited to the 1920 Games, with the [Russian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War") still raging, and they did not participate in the [1924 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Summer_Olympics "1924 Summer Olympics") and forward on ideological grounds. Instead, through the auspices of the [Red Sport International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sport_International "Red Sport International"), it had participated in a left-wing workers' alternative, the [Spartakiad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartakiad "Spartakiad"), since 1928. The USSR had intended to attend the People's Olympiad in Barcelona until it was cancelled; the Soviets did attend the Spartakiad-sponsored [1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Workers%27_Summer_Olympiad "1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad") in Antwerp, [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium").[^101] The Soviet Union started competing in the Olympics in [1952](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Summer_Olympics "1952 Summer Olympics"), when [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") realized that they could use the event to fulfil their political and ideological agenda.[^102]

[Halet Çambel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halet_%C3%87ambel "Halet Çambel") and [Suat Fetgeri Așani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suat_A%C5%9Fani "Suat Aşani"), the first [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_women "Turkish women") and Muslim women [^103] athletes to participate in the Olympics (fencing), refused an offer by their guide to be formally introduced to [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), saying they would not shake hands with him due to his approach to Jews, as stated by Ms. Çambel in a *Milliyet* newspaper interview in 2000.[^104]

Avery Brundage meeting the mayor of Berlin [Julius Lippert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Lippert_\(politician\) "Julius Lippert (politician)") and IOC German Secretary Theodor Lewald in 1936

Traditionally, the United States sent one of the largest teams to the Olympics, and there was a considerable debate over whether the nation should participate in the 1936 Games.[^95] Americans [Milton Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Green "Milton Green") and [Norman Cahners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Cahners "Norman Cahners") refused to attend, and the [American Jewish Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Congress "American Jewish Congress") and the [Jewish Labor Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Labor_Committee "Jewish Labor Committee") supported a boycott.[^95]

Those involved in the debate on whether to boycott the Olympics included [Ernest Lee Jahncke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Lee_Jahncke "Ernest Lee Jahncke"), Judge [Jeremiah T. Mahoney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_T._Mahoney "Jeremiah T. Mahoney"), and future [IOC President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC_President "IOC President") [Avery Brundage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brundage "Avery Brundage"). Some within the United States considered requesting a boycott of the Games, as to participate in the festivity might be considered a sign of support for the Nazi regime and its antisemitic policies. However, others such as Brundage (see below) argued that the Olympic Games should not reflect political views, but rather should be strictly a contest of the greatest athletes.

Brundage, then of the American Olympic Committee, opposed the boycott, stating that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly and that the Games should continue. Brundage asserted that politics played no role in sports, and that they should never be entwined. Brundage also believed that there was a "Jewish-Communist conspiracy" that existed to keep the United States from competing in the Olympic Games.[^87] Somewhat ironically, Brundage would be later [accused of being a Soviet dupe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brundage#Soviet_Union "Avery Brundage") for his controversial stance on the Soviet sports system that allowed them to circumvent the amateur rules.[^105] [^106] On the subject of Jewish discrimination, he stated, "The very foundation of the modern Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed to restrict participation by reason of class, creed, or race." [^95]

During a fact-finding trip that Brundage went on to Germany in 1934 to ascertain whether German Jews were being treated fairly, Brundage found no discrimination when he interviewed Jews and his Nazi handlers translated for him, and Brundage commiserated with his hosts that he belonged to a sports club in Chicago that did not allow Jews entry, either.[^107]

Unlike Brundage, Mahoney supported a boycott of the Games. Mahoney, the president of the [Amateur Athletic Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Union "Amateur Athletic Union"), led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation in the Berlin Olympics. He contested that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich.

Most African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia *Tribune* and the *[Chicago Defender](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Defender "The Chicago Defender")* both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The [American Jewish Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Congress "American Jewish Congress") and the [Jewish Labor Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Labor_Committee "Jewish Labor Committee") staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation.[^87] The JLC organized the World Labor Athletic Carnival, held on 15 and 16 August at New York's Randall's Island, to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.[^108]

Eventually, Brundage won the debate, convincing the Amateur Athletic Union to close a vote in favor of sending an American team to the Berlin Olympics. Mahoney's efforts to incite a boycott of the Olympic games in the United States failed, although some athletes like Harvard University track star [Milton Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Green "Milton Green") chose to sit at home.[^19]

US President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt "Franklin Delano Roosevelt") and his administration did not become involved in the debate, due to a tradition of allowing the US Olympic Committee to operate independently of government influence. However, several American diplomats including [William E. Dodd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Dodd "William E. Dodd"), the American ambassador to Berlin, and [George Messersmith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Messersmith "George Messersmith"), head of the US legation in Vienna, deplored the US Olympic Committee's decision to participate in the games.[^95]

In 1937, [20th Century Fox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox "20th Century Fox") released the film *[Charlie Chan at the Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chan_at_the_Olympics "Charlie Chan at the Olympics")*. The plot concerned members of the [Berlin police force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnungspolizei "Ordnungspolizei") helping the Chinese detective apprehends a group of spies (of unnamed nationality) trying to steal a new aerial guidance system. Despite pertaining to the Berlin Olympics, actual Games' footage used by the filmmakers was edited to remove any Nazi symbols.[^109]

After the Olympics, Jewish participation in German sports was further limited, and persecution of Jews started to become ever more lethal. The Olympic Games provided a nine-month period of relative calmness.[^110]

Retrieved 7 October 2016. A controversial move at the Games was the benching of two American Jewish runners, Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller. Both had trained for the 4x100-meter relay, but on the day before the event, they were replaced by [Jesse Owens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens "Jesse Owens") and Ralph Metcalfe, the team's two fastest sprinters. Various reasons were given for the change. The coaches claimed they needed their fastest runners to win the race. Glickman has said that Coach Dean Cromwell and Avery Brundage were motivated by antisemitism and the desire to spare the Führer the embarrassing sight of two American Jews on the winning podium. Stoller did not believe antisemitism was involved, but the 21-year-old described the incident in his diary as the 'most humiliating episode' in his life.
