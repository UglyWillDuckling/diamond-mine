**Chinua Achebe** (; born **Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe**; 16 November 1930 – 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as a central figure of modern [African literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_literature "African literature"). His first novel and [magnum opus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus "Magnum opus"), *[Things Fall Apart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Fall_Apart "Things Fall Apart")* (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated, and read African novel. Along with *Things Fall Apart*, his *[No Longer at Ease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Longer_at_Ease "No Longer at Ease")* (1960) and *[Arrow of God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_God "Arrow of God")* (1964) complete the "African Trilogy". Later novels include *[A Man of the People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_of_the_People "A Man of the People")* (1966) and *[Anthills of the Savannah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthills_of_the_Savannah "Anthills of the Savannah")* (1987). In the West, Achebe is often referred (or recognized as) to as the "father of African literature", although he vigorously rejected the characterization.

Born in [Ogidi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogidi,_Anambra "Ogidi, Anambra"), [Colonial Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Nigeria "Colonial Nigeria"), Achebe's childhood was influenced by both [Igbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people "Igbo people") traditional culture and colonial Christianity. He excelled in school and attended what is now the [University of Ibadan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ibadan "University of Ibadan"), where he became fiercely critical of how [Western literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_literature "Western literature") depicted Africa. Moving to [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos") after graduation, he worked for the [Nigerian Broadcasting Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Broadcasting_Service "Nigerian Broadcasting Service") (NBS) and garnered international attention for his 1958 novel *Things Fall Apart*. In less than 10 years he would publish four further novels through the publisher [Heinemann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinemann_\(publisher\) "Heinemann (publisher)"), with whom he began the [Heinemann African Writers Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinemann_African_Writers_Series "Heinemann African Writers Series") and galvanized the careers of African writers, such as [Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C5%A9g%C4%A9_wa_Thiong%27o "Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o") and [Flora Nwapa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Nwapa "Flora Nwapa").

Achebe sought to escape the colonial perspective that framed African literature at the time, and drew from the traditions of the Igbo people, Christian influences, and the clash of Western and African values to create a uniquely African voice. He wrote in and defended the use of English, describing it as a means to reach a broad audience, particularly readers of colonial nations. In 1975 he gave a controversial lecture, "[An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Image_of_Africa "An Image of Africa")", which was a landmark in [postcolonial discourse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonial_literature "Postcolonial literature"). Published in *[The Massachusetts Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Massachusetts_Review "The Massachusetts Review")*, it featured criticism of [Albert Schweitzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer "Albert Schweitzer") and [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad"), whom Achebe described as "a thoroughgoing racist." When the region of [Biafra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biafra "Biafra") broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe supported Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the movement. The subsequent [Nigerian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War "Nigerian Civil War") ravaged the populace, and he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon became disillusioned by his frustration over the continuous corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the US in 1990 after a car crash left him partially paralyzed. He stayed in the US in a nineteen-year tenure at [Bard College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard_College "Bard College") as a professor of languages and literature.

Winning the 2007 [Man Booker International Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Booker_International_Prize "Man Booker International Prize"), from 2009 until his death he was Professor of [African Studies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Studies "African Studies") at [Brown University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University "Brown University"). Achebe's work has been extensively analyzed and a vast body of scholarly work discussing it has arisen. In addition to his seminal novels, [Achebe's *oeuvre*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Writings) includes numerous short stories, poetry, essays and children's books. A titled Igbo [chief](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_chiefs "Nigerian chiefs") himself, his style relies heavily on the Igbo [oral tradition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition "Oral tradition"), and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. Among the many themes his works cover are culture and colonialism, masculinity and femininity, politics, and history. His legacy is celebrated annually at the [Chinua Achebe Literary Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe_Literary_Festival "Chinua Achebe Literary Festival").
