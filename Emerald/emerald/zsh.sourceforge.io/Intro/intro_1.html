<STRONG>zsh</STRONG> is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is
also a powerful scripting language.  Many of the useful features of
bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features
were added.  This document details some of the unique features of zsh.
It assumes basic knowledge of the standard UNIX shells; the intent is to
show a reader already familiar with one of the other major shells what
makes zsh more useful or more powerful.  This document is not at all
comprehensive; read the manual entry for a description of the shell that
is complete and concise, although somewhat overwhelming and devoid of
examples.
