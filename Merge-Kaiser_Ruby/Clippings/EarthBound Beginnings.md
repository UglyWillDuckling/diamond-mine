***EarthBound Beginnings***, originally released in Japan as ***Mother*** <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>b<span>]</span></a></sup>, is a 1989 [role-playing video game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game "Role-playing video game") developed by [Ape Inc.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_Inc. "Creatures Inc.") and [Nintendo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo "Nintendo") and published by Nintendo for the [Family Computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computer "Family Computer"). It is the first entry in the [*Mother*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_\(video_game_series\) "Mother (video game series)") series and was first released in Japan on July 27, 1989. The game was re-released in Japan along with [its sequel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound "EarthBound") on the single-cartridge [compilation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_compilation "Video game compilation") *[Mother 1+2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_1%2B2 "Mother 1+2")* for the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance") in 2003.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The game follows a young American boy named Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on [psychic powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psionics "Psionics") to put an end to the [paranormal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal "Paranormal") phenomena spiraling the country into disarray.

Writer and director [Shigesato Itoi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigesato_Itoi "Shigesato Itoi") pitched *Mother* ' s concept to [Shigeru Miyamoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto "Shigeru Miyamoto") while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. Modeled after the gameplay of the *[Dragon Quest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest "Dragon Quest")* series, *Mother* subverted its fantasy genre contemporaries by being set in an offbeat parody of the late 20th-century United States. Itoi sought to incorporate standard RPG staples within the framework of a modern-day setting, parodying [Western culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") and [Americana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_\(culture\) "Americana (culture)"). As such, throughout the game, players use [medication](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication "Medication") and [hospitals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital "Hospital") to restore their health, utilize [baseball bats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bats "Baseball bats") and [toy guns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_guns "Toy guns") to fight enemies, and encounter [aliens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life"), [robots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots "Robots"), [possessed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_possession "Spirit possession") objects, and [brainwashed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing "Brainwashing") animals and humans. *Mother* uses [random encounters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_encounter "Random encounter") to enter a menu-based, [first-person perspective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_\(video_games\) "First-person (video games)") battle system.

*Mother* sold around 400,000 copies upon its release, where it was praised for its similarities to the *Dragon Quest* series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, though its high [difficulty level](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difficulty_level "Difficulty level") and [balance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_\(game_design\) "Balance (game design)") issues polarized critics. A North American [localization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_localization "Game localization") of *Mother* was completed and slated for release as *Earth Bound*, but was abandoned as being commercially nonviable. A finished prototype was later found and publicly circulated on the Internet under the informal title ***EarthBound Zero***. Though many critics considered *Mother* ' s sequel to be similar and an overall better implementation of its gameplay ideas, Jeremy Parish of *[1UP.com](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1UP.com "1UP.com")* wrote that *Mother* importantly generated interest in [video game emulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_emulation "Video game emulation") and the historical preservation of unreleased games.

In 1994, *Mother* ' s sequel, *[Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound "EarthBound")*, was released in Japan for the [Super Famicom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Famicom "Super Famicom"), which was localized and released in America in 1995 under the name " *EarthBound* ". *EarthBound* initially flopped in the U.S., but later gained a [cult following](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound_fan_community "EarthBound fan community"). *EarthBound* was followed by the Japan-only sequel *[Mother 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3 "Mother 3")* for the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance") in 2006. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of *EarthBound* ' s U.S. release, *Mother* was released globally as *EarthBound Beginnings* for the [Wii U](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U "Wii U") [Virtual Console](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Console "Virtual Console") in June 2015, and was released alongside *EarthBound* for the [Nintendo Classics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Classics "Nintendo Classics") service in February 2022.
