## intro

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([[HTTP]]). 
It uses [[encryption]] for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the [[Internet]]. 
In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security ([[TLS]]) or, formerly, 
[[SSL|Secure Sockets Layer]]. The protocol is therefore also referred to as [[HTTP]] over [[TLS]], or [[HTTP]] over [[SSL]].

## reasoning

The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while it is in transit. 
It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional block cipher encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. 
The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">trusted third party</mark> to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">sign</mark> server-side digital certificates.
