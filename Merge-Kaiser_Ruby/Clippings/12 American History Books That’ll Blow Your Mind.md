You know that women, along with many other groups, didn’t always have the right to vote in America. But do you know the history of how that changed? And why it was such a fight for them to gain that right? It’s not something often explored in elementary school history classes, so if you’re interested, you might have to look into it yourself. This book by one of the suffragists is a good place to start. Doris Stevens, who worked with Alice Paul, published a firsthand account of the National Woman’s Party, which organized and fought a fierce battle for passage of the 19th Amendment. The book details the hunger strikes, forced feedings, and jail terms suffragists endured to secure their right to vote, and inspired a Broadway musical, [*Suffs*](https://katiecouric.com/entertainment/suffs-broadway-show-shaina-taub-womens-suffrage/).
