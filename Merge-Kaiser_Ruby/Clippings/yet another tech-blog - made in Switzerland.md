## [check\_esxi\_hardware 20250221 released: pywbem exception improvements](https://www.claudiokuenzler.com/blog/1473/check-esxi-hardware-20250221-release-pywbem-exception-improvements)

---

A new version of [check\_esxi\_hardware](https://www.claudiokuenzler.com/monitoring-plugins/check_esxi_hardware.php), an open source monitoring plugin to monitor the hardware of [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html) servers, is available.

## Improve/Fix pywbem exceptions

The latest version (20250221) of check\_esxi\_hardware improves the handling of exceptions coming from the pywbem Python module.

The pywbem internal exceptions were renamed at the release of pywbem 1.0.0. Examples:

| pywbem < 1.0.0 | pywbem >= 1.0.0 |
| --- | --- |
| pywbem.cim\_operations | pywbem.\_cim\_operations |
| pywbem.cim\_http | pywbem.\_cim\_http |
| pywbem.exceptions | pywbem.\_exceptions |

You certainly noticed the added underscore (\_) in the name.

Backward compatibility is important to me. To be able to support older (prior to 1.0.0) AND newer versions of pywbem, check\_esxi\_hardware now makes a version comparison of the installed and used pywbem version. This is done by using the Python module "packaging".

This means: **Starting with this release (20250221), the packaging Python module must be installed** to run check\_esxi\_hardware.

This can be done by using a predefined package from the OS:

$ sudo apt install python3-packaging

Or use pip system-wide:

$ sudo pip3 install packaging

Or inside your Python3 venv, use pip as well.

## Catch HTTP Exception

While working on the improved pywbem exception handling, I also came across another exception, the plugin did not cover before: The HTTP exception!

This is useful when the plugin is mistakenly pointed to a HTTP endpoint which does not serve any CIM elements (ESXi HTTPS UI for example). The plugin will then show the HTTP exception and exit as UNKNOWN:

ck@mint ~ $ /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check\_esxi\_hardware.py -H myesxi -C 443 -U root -P secret  
**UNKNOWN: 400 (Bad Request)**

In the past this would have shown a large Python stacktrace error.  

## Thanks and kudos

As always, this is an open source monitoring plugin and this often involves multiple people to get a new release out. Special thanks for this release go to [Phil Randal](https://github.com/philrandal) and [Claire Morgenthau](https://github.com/clairem-sl) for important and much appreciated coding hints.
