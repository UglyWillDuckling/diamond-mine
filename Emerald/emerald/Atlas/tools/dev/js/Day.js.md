## Why Day.js?

### 2kB

Less JavaScript to download, parse and execute, leaving more time for your code.

### Simple

Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API.

If you use Moment.js, you already know how to use Day.js.

### Immutable

All API operations that change the Day.js object will return a new instance instead.

This helps prevent bugs and avoid long debugging sessions.

### I18n

Day.js has great support for internationalization. But none of them will be included in your build unless you use them.
