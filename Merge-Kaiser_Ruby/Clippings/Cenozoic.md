The **Cenozoic Era** ( [*SEE\-nə-ZOH\-ik, SEN\-ə-*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key");[^1][^2] lit. 'new life') is Earth's current geological [era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_\(geology\) "Era (geology)"), representing the last 66 million years of Earth's history. It is characterized by the dominance of [mammals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal"), [insects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect "Insect"), [birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird "Bird") and [angiosperms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant "Flowering plant") (flowering plants). It is the latest of three geological eras of the [Phanerozoic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic "Phanerozoic") [Eon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eon_\(geology\) "Eon (geology)"), preceded by the [Mesozoic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic "Mesozoic") and [Paleozoic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic"). The Cenozoic started with the [Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event "Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event"), when many species, including the non-avian [dinosaurs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs "Dinosaurs"), became extinct in an event attributed by most experts to the impact of a large asteroid or other celestial body, the [Chicxulub impactor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor "Chicxulub impactor").

The **Cenozoic** is also known as the **Age of Mammals** because the terrestrial animals that dominated both hemispheres were mammals – the [eutherians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria "Eutheria") ([placentals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental "Placental")) in the Northern Hemisphere and the [metatherians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatheria "Metatheria") ([marsupials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial "Marsupial"), now mainly restricted to [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") and to some extent [South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America")) in the Southern Hemisphere. The extinction of many groups allowed mammals and birds to greatly diversify so that large mammals and birds dominated life on Earth. The continents also moved into their current positions during this era.

The climate during the early Cenozoic was warmer than today, particularly during the [Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum "Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum"). However, the [Eocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene") to [Oligocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene "Oligocene") transition and the [Quaternary glaciation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation") dried and cooled Earth.

*Cenozoic* derives from the Greek words *kainós* ([καινός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:καινός") 'new') and *zōḗ* ([ζωή](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B6%CF%89%CE%AE#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ζωή") 'life').[^onlineetymologydict-3] The name was proposed in 1840 by the British geologist [John Phillips](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Phillips_\(geologist\) "John Phillips (geologist)") (1800–1874), who originally spelled it *Kainozoic*.[^4][^5][^6] The era is also known as the *Cænozoic*, *Caenozoic*, or *Cainozoic* ().[^7][^8]

In name, the Cenozoic (lit. 'new life') is comparable to the preceding Mesozoic ('middle life') and Paleozoic ('old life') Eras, as well as to the Proterozoic ('earlier life') Eon.

The Cenozoic is divided into **three periods:** the [Paleogene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene "Paleogene"), [Neogene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene "Neogene"), and [Quaternary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary "Quaternary"); and seven [epochs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_\(geology\) "Epoch (geology)"): the [Paleocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene "Paleocene"), [Eocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene"), [Oligocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene "Oligocene"), [Miocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene "Miocene"), [Pliocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene "Pliocene"), [Pleistocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene"), and [Holocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene"). 
The **[[Quaternary]]** Period was officially recognised by the [International Commission on Stratigraphy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy "International Commission on Stratigraphy") in June 2009.[^gibbard-2010-9] 

In **2004**, the [Tertiary Period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_Period "Tertiary Period") was officially replaced by the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] Periods. The common use of epochs during the Cenozoic helps [palaeontologists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeontologist "Palaeontologist") better organise and group the many significant events that occurred during this comparatively short interval of time. Knowledge of this era is more detailed than any other era because of the relatively young, well-preserved rocks associated with it.


## [[Paleogene]] 

The **Paleogene** spans from the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, **66 million years ago**, to the dawn of the **Neogene**, **23.03** million years ago. It features three [epochs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_\(geology\) "Epoch (geology)"): the [Paleocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene "Paleocene"), [Eocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene") and [Oligocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene "Oligocene")
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Basilosaurus.jpg/220px-Basilosaurus.jpg)

*[Basilosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilosaurus "Basilosaurus")*

### [[Clippings/Paleocene|Paleocene]]

The [Paleocene Epoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene_Epoch "Paleocene Epoch") lasted from 66 million to 56 million years ago. Modern **placental** mammals originated during this time.[^o'leary-2013-10] The devastation of the [K–Pg extinction event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%93Pg_extinction_event "K–Pg extinction event") included the extinction of large [herbivores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore "Herbivore"), which permitted the spread of dense but usually species-poor **forests**.[^williams-2009-11][^12] 

The **Early Paleocene** saw the recovery of Earth. The continents began to take their modern shape, but all the continents and the subcontinent of India were separated from each other. [Afro-Eurasia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Eurasia "Afro-Eurasia") was separated by the [Tethys Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Sea "Tethys Sea"), and the Americas were separated by the strait of Panama, as the [isthmus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama "Isthmus of Panama") had not yet formed.

 This epoch featured a general ==warming== trend, **with jungles eventually reaching the poles.** 

The oceans were dominated by sharks[^13] as the large reptiles that had once predominated were extinct. Archaic mammals filled the world such as [creodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonts "Creodonts") (extinct carnivores, unrelated to existing [Carnivora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora "Carnivora")).

- **10 my**: 66-56
- Placental mammals 
- dense forests
- [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys See]]
- Americas still separated 
- **Warming** trend: jungles reaching the poles
- Sharks dominating the seas
- [[Creodonts]] on land

### [[Eocene]]

The [Eocene Epoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene_Epoch "Eocene Epoch") ranged from **56 million years to 33.9 million years ago**. In the Early-Eocene, species living in dense forest were unable to evolve into larger forms, as in the Paleocene. Among them were early primates, whales and horses along with many other early forms of mammals. At the top of the food chains were huge birds, such as [[Paracrax]]. Carbon dioxide levels were approximately 1,400 [ppm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million "Parts per million").[^14] 

The temperature was **30 degrees Celsius** with little temperature gradient from pole to pole. In the Mid-Eocene, the [Antarctic Circumpolar Current](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current "Antarctic Circumpolar Current") between Australia and Antarctica formed. This disrupted ocean currents worldwide and as a result caused a **global cooling effect,** shrinking the jungles. This allowed mammals to grow to mammoth proportions, such as whales which, by that time, had become almost fully aquatic. Mammals like *[Andrewsarchus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrewsarchus "Andrewsarchus")* were at the top of the food-chain. 

**The Late Eocene** saw the rebirth of **seasons**, which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas, along with the evolution of [grasses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasses "Grasses").[^15][^16] The eond of the Eocene was marked by the [Eocene–Oligocene extinction event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene%E2%80%93Oligocene_extinction_event "Eocene–Oligocene extinction event"),[^17][^18][^ivany-2000-19] the European face of which is known as the [Grande Coupure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Coupure "Grande Coupure").[^20][^21]
[[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]]

### Oligocene 

The [Oligocene Epoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene_Epoch "Oligocene Epoch") spans from **33.9 million to 23.03** million years ago. The Oligocene featured the expansion of grasslands which had led to many new species to evolve, including the **first elephants, cats, dogs, marsupials** and many other species still prevalent today. Many other species of plants evolved in this period too. 
**A cooling period featuring seasonal rains was still in effect.** 
Mammals still continued to grow larger and larger.[^22]

## Neogene

The Neogene spans from 23.03 million to 2.58 million years ago. It features **two epochs**: 
the **Miocene, and the Pliocene.**[^23]

### [[Miocene]]

The [Miocene Epoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene_Epoch "Miocene Epoch") spans from **23.03 to 5.333 million years ago** and is a period in which [grasses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasses "Grasses") spread further, dominating a large portion of the world, at the expense of forests. [Kelp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp "Kelp") forests evolved, encouraging the evolution of new species, such as [sea otters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_otter "Sea otter"). During this time, [Perissodactyla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perissodactyla "Perissodactyla") thrived, and evolved into many different varieties. [Apes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apes "Apes") evolved into 30 species. The [Tethys Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Sea "Tethys Sea") finally closed with the creation of the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula"), leaving only remnants as the [Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea "Black Sea"), [Red](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea"), [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") and [Caspian Seas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea"). This increased aridity. Many new plants evolved: 95% of modern [seed plants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatophyte "Spermatophyte") families were present by the end of the Miocene.[^24]

[[Tethys Ocean]]


### [[Pliocene]] 

**5.33 - 2.58 m.y.a.**

The [Pliocene Epoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene_Epoch "Pliocene Epoch") lasted from **5.333 to 2.58** million years ago. 
The Pliocene featured **dramatic climatic changes**, which ultimately led to modern species of flora and fauna. 

**The Mediterranean Sea dried up** for several million years (because the [ice ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age") reduced sea levels, disconnecting the [Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") from the Mediterranean, and evaporation rates exceeded inflow from rivers). 

*[Australopithecus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus "Australopithecus")* evolved in [Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), beginning the human branch. 
The [Isthmus of Panama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama "Isthmus of Panama") formed, and animals migrated between [North](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and [South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") during the [great American interchange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_interchange "Great American interchange"), wreaking havoc on local ecologies. 

Climatic changes brought: [savannas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") that are still continuing to spread across the world; Indian [monsoons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon"); [deserts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert") in central [Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"); and the beginnings of the [Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara") desert. The world map has not changed much since, save for changes brought about by the [glaciations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciations "Glaciations") of the Quaternary, such as the [Great Lakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes "Great Lakes"), [Hudson Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Bay "Hudson Bay"), and the [Baltic Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea").[^25][^26]
## [[Quaternary]] 

The [Quaternary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary "Quaternary") spans from **2.58 million years ago to present day**, and is the shortest geological period in the [Phanerozoic Eon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic_Eon "Phanerozoic Eon"). It features modern animals, and dramatic changes in the climate.

It is divided into two epochs: 
the **Pleistocene and the Holocene**.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Ice_age_fauna_of_northern_Spain_-_Mauricio_Ant%C3%B3n.jpg/220px-Ice_age_fauna_of_northern_Spain_-_Mauricio_Ant%C3%B3n.jpg)

Megafauna of **Pleistocene Europe** ([mammoths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth "Mammoth"), [cave lions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_spelaea "Panthera spelaea"), [woolly rhino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_rhino "Woolly rhino"), [reindeer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer "Reindeer"), [horses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_horse "Wild horse"))

### [[Pleistocene]] 

The [Pleistocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene") lasted from 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago. This epoch was marked by [ice ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_ages "Ice ages") as a result of the cooling trend that started in the Mid-Eocene. There were at least **four separate glaciation periods** marked by the advance of ice caps as far south as 40° N in mountainous areas. Meanwhile, Africa experienced a trend of [desiccation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiccation "Desiccation") which resulted in the creation of the [Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_desert "Sahara desert"), [Namib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib_Desert "Namib Desert"), and [Kalahari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalahari_Desert "Kalahari Desert") deserts. Many animals evolved including [mammoths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth "Mammoth"), [giant ground sloths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_ground_sloths "Giant ground sloths"), [dire wolves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_wolves "Dire wolves"), sabre-toothed cats, and *[Homo sapiens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens "Homo sapiens")*. 100,000 years ago marked the end of one of the worst droughts in Africa, and led to the expansion of primitive humans. As the Pleistocene drew to a close, a major extinction wiped out much of the world's megafauna, including some of the hominid species, such as [Neanderthals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal "Neanderthal"). All the continents were affected, but Africa to a lesser extent. It still retains many large animals, such as hippos.[^27]


### Holocene 

The [Holocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene") began **11,700 years ago** and lasts to the present day. All recorded history and "the [Human history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history "Human history")" lies within the boundaries of the Holocene Epoch.[^28] Human activity is blamed for a mass extinction that began roughly 10,000 years ago, though the species becoming extinct have only been recorded since the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"). This is sometimes referred to as the "[Sixth Extinction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Extinction "Sixth Extinction")". It is often cited that over 322 recorded species have become extinct due to human activity since the Industrial Revolution,[^29][^30] but the rate may be as high as 500 vertebrate species alone, the majority of which have occurred after 1900.[^31]

## General 

[Geologically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), the Cenozoic is the era when the [continents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") moved into their current positions. 

[Australia-New Guinea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_\(continent\) "Australia (continent)"), having split from [Pangea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangea "Pangea") during the early [Cretaceous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous"), drifted north and, eventually, collided with [Southeast Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-east_Asia "South-east Asia"); 

[Antarctica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") moved into its current position over the [South Pole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole"); the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") widened and, later in the era (2.8 million years ago), [South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") became attached to [North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") with the [isthmus of Panama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama "Isthmus of Panama").

India collided with Asia [55 to 45](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=55%E2%80%9345) million years ago creating the Himalayas;
Arabia collided with Eurasia, closing the [Tethys Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Ocean "Tethys Ocean") and creating the [Zagros Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagros_Mountains "Zagros Mountains"), around [35](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=35) million years ago.[^allen-2008-32]

The break-up of Gondwana in [Late Cretaceous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Cretaceous "Late Cretaceous") and Cenozoic times led to a shift in the river courses of various large African rivers including the [Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_River "Congo River"), [Niger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_River "Niger River"), [Nile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile"), [Orange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_River "Orange River"), [Limpopo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo_River "Limpopo River") and [Zambezi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambezi_River "Zambezi River").[^33]

### Climate

In the Cretaceous, the climate was hot and humid with lush forests at the poles, there was no permanent ice and sea levels were around 300 metres higher than today. This continued for the first 10 million years of the Paleocene, culminating in the [Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum "Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum") about [55.5](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=55.5) million years ago. Around [50](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=50) million years ago, Earth entered a period of long term cooling. This was mainly due to the collision of India with Eurasia, which caused the rise of the [Himalayas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas "Himalayas"): the upraised rocks eroded and reacted with CO<sub>2</sub> in the air, causing a long-term reduction in the proportion of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Around [35](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=35) million years ago, permanent ice began to build up on Antarctica.[^34] The cooling trend continued in the [Miocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene "Miocene"), with relatively short warmer periods. When South America became attached to North America creating the [Isthmus of Panama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama "Isthmus of Panama") around [2.8](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=2.8) million years ago, the Arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the [Humboldt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_Current "Humboldt Current") and [Gulf Stream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream") currents,[^35] eventually leading to the glaciations of the [Quaternary ice age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation"), the current [interglacial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial "Interglacial") of which is the [Holocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene") Epoch. Recent analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency, oxygen isotope record, and tectonic plate subduction rate, which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary, climate and plate tectonic activity, shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years' timescale in the Cenozoic Era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of ~13 Myr during most of the time.[^36] The levels of carbonate ions in the ocean fell over the course of the Cenozoic.[^37]

Restoration of *[Palaeotherium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeotherium "Palaeotherium")*, a [Paleogene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene "Paleogene") relative of horses that lived in subtropical climates of Europe during the [Eocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene")

Early in the Cenozoic, following the [K-Pg event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous-Paleogene_Extinction_Event "Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event"), the planet was dominated by relatively small fauna, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals to greatly diversify in the absence of the dinosaurs that had dominated during the Mesozoic.[^38] Birds also diversified rapidly; some flightless birds grew larger than humans. These species are sometimes referred to as "[terror birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_bird "Terror bird")", and were formidable predators. Mammals came to occupy almost every available [niche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche "Ecological niche") (both marine and [terrestrial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal "Terrestrial animal")), and some also grew very large, attaining sizes not seen in most of today's terrestrial mammals. The ranges of many Cenozoic bird clades were governed by latitude and temperature and have contracted over the course of this era as the world cooled.[^39]

During the Cenozoic, [mammals proliferated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal_evolution#Expansion_of_ecological_niches_in_the_Mesozoic "Mammal evolution") from a few small, simple, generalised forms into a diverse collection of [terrestrial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal "Terrestrial animal"), [marine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal "Marine mammal"), and [flying](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat "Bat") animals, giving this period its other name, the Age of Mammals. The Cenozoic is just as much the age of [savannas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna "Savanna"), the age of co-dependent [flowering plants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant "Flowering plant") and [insects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect "Insect"), and the age of birds.[^40] [Grasses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasses "Grasses") also played a very important role in this era, shaping the evolution of the birds and mammals that fed on them. One group that diversified significantly in the Cenozoic as well were the [snakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake "Snake"). Evolving in the Cenozoic, the variety of snakes increased tremendously, resulting in many [colubrids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colubrids "Colubrids"), following the evolution of their current primary prey source, the [rodents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent "Rodent").

In the earlier part of the Cenozoic, the world was dominated by the [gastornithid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastornithidae "Gastornithidae") birds, terrestrial [crocodylians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodylian "Crocodylian") like *[Pristichampsus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pristichampsus "Pristichampsus")*, large sharks such as [Otodus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otodus "Otodus"), and a handful of primitive large mammal groups like [uintatheres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uintathere "Uintathere"), [mesonychians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonychia "Mesonychia"), and [pantodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantodont "Pantodont"). But as the forests began to recede and the climate began to cool, other mammals took over.

The Cenozoic is full of mammals both strange and familiar, including [chalicotheres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalicothere "Chalicothere"), [creodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodont "Creodont"), [whales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale "Whale"), [primates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate "Primate"), [entelodonts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entelodont "Entelodont"), [sabre-toothed cats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre-toothed_cat "Sabre-toothed cat"), [mastodons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon "Mastodon") and [mammoths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth "Mammoth"), [three-toed horses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-toed_horse "Three-toed horse"), giant [rhinoceros](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros "Rhinoceros") like *[Paraceratherium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraceratherium "Paraceratherium")*, the rhinoceros-like [brontotheres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brontothere "Brontothere"), various bizarre groups of mammals from South America, such as the vaguely elephant-like [pyrotheres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotheria "Pyrotheria") and the dog-like marsupial relatives called [borhyaenids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borhyaenidae "Borhyaenidae") and the [monotremes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotreme "Monotreme") and marsupials of Australia. Mammal evolution in the Cenozoic was predominantly shaped by climatic and geological processes.[^41][^42]

Cenozoic [calcareous nannoplankton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcareous_nannofossils "Calcareous nannofossils") experienced rapid rates of speciation and reduced species longevity, while suffering prolonged declines in diversity during the Eocene and Neogene. [Diatoms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom"), in contrast, experienced major diversification over the Eocene, especially at high latitudes, as the world's oceans cooled.[^43] Diatom diversification was particularly concentrated at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A second major pulse of diatom diversification occurred over the course of the Middle and Late Miocene.[^44]
