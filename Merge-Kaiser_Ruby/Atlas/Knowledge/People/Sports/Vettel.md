However, Vettel crashed into Webber under [safety car](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car "Safety car") conditions, forcing both cars to retire. Webber said after the race: "It's kids isn't it. Kids with not enough experience – you do a good job and then they fuck it all up".[^29] Vettel was initially punished with a ten-place grid penalty for the following race, but this was lifted after a spectator video on [YouTube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") showed the incident may have been caused by Hamilton's behaviour behind the safety car.[^30]

At the [Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2008 Monaco Grand Prix"), Vettel scored his first points of the season with a fifth-place finish, after qualifying 17th. Toro Rosso's technical director Giorgio Ascanelli explained that something changed at the [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_European_Grand_Prix "2008 European Grand Prix") in [Valencia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia "Valencia"): "Suddenly Vettel understood something about how to drive an F1 car quickly. It made a huge difference – not only to the speed he could unlock but also to his ability to do so consistently." [^34]

At the wet [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Italian_Grand_Prix "2008 Italian Grand Prix"), Vettel became the [youngest driver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_winners "List of Formula One driver records") in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix, aged 21 years and 74 days.[^35] He led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of [McLaren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") 's [Heikki Kovalainen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikki_Kovalainen "Heikki Kovalainen").[^36] It would also be Toro Rosso's only win.[^37] Earlier in the weekend, he had already become the [youngest pole-sitter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_driver_records#Youngest_polesitters "List of Formula One driver records").[^38] Toro Rosso team boss [Gerhard Berger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Berger "Gerhard Berger") said: "As he proved today, he can win races, but he's going to win World Championships. He's a cool guy".[^39] His victory led the German media to dub him "Baby Schumi".[^40]

Both were equal on points in the standings, with Webber first based on total wins.[^52] At the [Turkish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Turkish_Grand_Prix "2010 Turkish Grand Prix"), Vettel was running second behind Webber when he made a passing move on his teammate. The two collided, putting Vettel out of the race, with neither driver accepting responsibility for the collision.[^53]

At the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_British_Grand_Prix "2010 British Grand Prix"), both Vettel and Webber's cars were fitted with a new front wing design. Vettel's wing was damaged in the third practice session, and Webber's sole surviving example was removed and given to his teammate.[^54] Vettel qualified in first place, but suffered a puncture. He finished seventh while Webber took the victory. In [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2010 Japanese Grand Prix"), he qualified on pole ahead of Webber and went on to win with a lights-to-flag victory. Aged 23 years and 98 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver to win at the same track on two occasions.[^12] At the inaugural [Korean Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Korean_Grand_Prix "2010 Korean Grand Prix"), Vettel led the first 45 laps before retiring with engine failure, handing victory to championship rival [Fernando Alonso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso "Fernando Alonso").[^55]

With the 1–2 finish at the [Brazilian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2010 Brazilian Grand Prix"), Vettel and Webber secured Red Bull Racing's first [World Constructors' Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions "List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions").[^56] Vettel went into the final race of the season in [Abu Dhabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix") with a 15-point deficit to Alonso and a 7-point gap to Webber.[^57] He won the Grand Prix from pole to become the youngest [World Drivers' Champion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions "List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions") in the sport's history, as Alonso only finished in seventh place.[^58] Following [John Surtees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Surtees "John Surtees") in the [1964](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Formula_One_season "1964 Formula One season") season and [James Hunt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hunt "James Hunt") in [1976](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Formula_One_season "1976 Formula One season"), this was the third time in Formula One history that the title winner had not topped the championship table until after the last race.[^59]

Vettel's win at the [2011 Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2011 Monaco Grand Prix") was his first win in the principality, and his fifth from the first six races of the 2011 season.

Vettel at the [2011 Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2011 Japanese Grand Prix") where, with four races remaining in the season, he became the youngest double World Drivers' Champion

Vettel at the [2012 United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_Grand_Prix "2012 United States Grand Prix")

Vettel started the [2011](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Formula_One_World_Championship "2011 Formula One World Championship") season with wins in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Grand_Prix "2011 Australian Grand Prix") and [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2011 Malaysian Grand Prix"), before a second-place finish at the [Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2011 Chinese Grand Prix") due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken.[^60] In [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2011 Monaco Grand Prix"), Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared when he came in. The [pit stop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop "Pit stop") was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button. Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him.[^61] The race was [red-flagged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_red-flagged_Formula_One_races "List of red-flagged Formula One races") with few laps remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead and win.[^62]

At the [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_European_Grand_Prix "2011 European Grand Prix"), the [Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile "Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile") (FIA) enforced a ban on engine mappings. It was believed by some in the press that this was an attempt by the FIA to thwart Vettel's early domination.[^63] Nevertheless, he took pole with the fastest qualifying lap in [Valencia Street Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_Street_Circuit "Valencia Street Circuit") 's history. Vettel dominated with his first [hat-trick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick#Motor_racing "Hat-trick") of 2011, and won his sixth race out of eight.[^64] The FIA implemented another rule change at the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_British_Grand_Prix "2011 British Grand Prix"), targeting the blown diffusers. Red Bull believed the changes would cost them about half a second per lap.[^65] During the race, Vettel held off Webber for second place, who ignored a radio message from team principal [Christian Horner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner "Christian Horner") to hold position.[^66] It was only the second time in the sport's history that a driver had finished second or higher in each of the first nine races of a season and won at least six of them.[^67]

Vettel's run of fourteen successive front-row starts and eleven successive top two finishes ended at [his home race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_German_Grand_Prix "2011 German Grand Prix"), where he qualified third and finished fourth. In [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Italian_Grand_Prix "2011 Italian Grand Prix"), he took his tenth pole position of the year, in which he joined [Ayrton Senna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna "Ayrton Senna") as the only driver to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons.[^68] A podium finish in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2011 Japanese Grand Prix") secured his second successive title with four races remaining, making him the youngest ever double and back-to-back champion.[^69] Vettel won the following race in [Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Korean_Grand_Prix "2011 Korean Grand Prix") to become the second driver to take at least ten wins in a season after Michael Schumacher.[^70] He also helped to secure Red Bull's second successive World Constructors' Championship.[^71] Vettel took his eleventh victory of the season in [the inaugural Indian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Grand_Prix "2011 Indian Grand Prix"), leading every lap from pole position, as well as setting the race's fastest lap to claim his first [grand slam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_\(Formula_One\) "Grand slam (Formula One)").[^72] Vettel broke the record for the most pole positions in a season at the season finale in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2011 Brazilian Grand Prix"), after he clinched his 15th pole of the year.[^73] He completed the year with 15 poles, 11 victories, and 17 podiums from 19 races; Vettel also earned a record total of 392 points.[^74]

Vettel started the [2012](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Formula_One_World_Championship "2012 Formula One World Championship") season with a second place at the [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Australian_Grand_Prix "2012 Australian Grand Prix"), before he finished outside the points in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2012 Malaysian Grand Prix") following a collision with backmarker [Narain Karthikeyan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narain_Karthikeyan "Narain Karthikeyan"). Vettel and Horner criticised Karthikeyan's driving, with Vettel calling him an "idiot",[^75] and a "cucumber".[^76] Karthikeyan hit back, calling Vettel a "cry baby".[^77] Vettel crossed the line in first place at the [Bahrain Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2012 Bahrain Grand Prix") to go top of the championship standings.[^78] Three races without a podium place followed, before he retired at the [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_European_Grand_Prix "2012 European Grand Prix") after an alternator failure, dropping him to fourth in the standings.[^79] In [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_German_Grand_Prix "2012 German Grand Prix"), Vettel finished second behind Alonso but received a 20-second time penalty after the race, as he was off the track when he overtook Button; Vettel dropped back to fifth.[^80] He started in 10th place but finished second in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2012 Belgian Grand Prix") to climb up to second place in the championship.[^81] Vettel then retired at the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Italian_Grand_Prix "2012 Italian Grand Prix") due to an alternator failure, which saw the gap to leader Alonso grow to 39 points with seven races remaining.[^82] [^83] He won next race in [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2012 Singapore Grand Prix"), as he kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was reached.[^84] At the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2012 Japanese Grand Prix") he took his second career grand slam and coupled with Alonso's retirement, he cut the gap down to just four points.[^85] After winning at the [Korean Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Korean_Grand_Prix "2012 Korean Grand Prix"), the [Indian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Grand_Prix "2012 Indian Grand Prix") brought another victory, as Vettel topped all three practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to win.[^86]

During qualifying at the [Abu Dhabi Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Abu_Dhabi_Grand_Prix "2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix"), Vettel was told to stop the car due to a fuel pump issue; he was forced to start from the pit lane.[^87] From last place, Vettel fought his way back to finish in third place.[^88] He started the last race in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2012 Brazilian Grand Prix") with a 13-point cushion against Alonso.[^89] On the opening lap, Vettel spun after an incident with [Bruno Senna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Senna "Bruno Senna"). Following changing weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to finish in sixth place to win the championship by three points and to become the youngest ever triple world champion.[^90] He also became the third driver to acquire three consecutive championships, after [Juan Manuel Fangio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Fangio "Juan Manuel Fangio") and Schumacher.[^91]

Vettel (left) controversially passing teammate [Mark Webber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Webber_\(racing_driver\) "Mark Webber (racing driver)") at the [2013 Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2013 Malaysian Grand Prix"), despite team orders to maintain position

Vettel started the first two races of the [2013](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Formula_One_World_Championship "2013 Formula One World Championship") season on pole position, and at the [Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2013 Malaysian Grand Prix"), he lapped over 2.5 seconds faster than teammate Webber in qualifying during a wet session.[^92] He won the race, though not without controversy. Vettel ignored the [team orders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_orders "Team orders") and passed Webber for the lead. Webber was furious after the race and said that Vettel "will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes".[^93] Team principal Horner, although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions. He acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident.[^94] Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.[^95]

Following wins in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2013 Bahrain Grand Prix") and [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2013 Canadian Grand Prix"), his championship lead was cut at the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_British_Grand_Prix "2013 British Grand Prix") as he was denied a likely win due to gearbox failure. Vettel bounced back to win his home race in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_German_Grand_Prix "2013 German Grand Prix") for the first time. After he finished third in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2013 Hungarian Grand Prix"), Vettel won the last nine races of the season, including grand slams in [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2013 Singapore Grand Prix") and [Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Korean_Grand_Prix "2013 Korean Grand Prix"). Vettel set the then-record for most consecutive race wins with nine and he became only the third man after [Alberto Ascari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Ascari "Alberto Ascari") and [Jim Clark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clark "Jim Clark") to take consecutive grand slams.[^96] He sealed his fourth world title at the [Indian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Indian_Grand_Prix "2013 Indian Grand Prix");[^97] before the race weekend, Formula One CEO [Bernie Ecclestone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Ecclestone "Bernie Ecclestone") stated that Vettel was "probably the best \[driver\] we've ever had".[^98]

> *"It's very difficult for me personally, to receive boos, even though you haven't done anything wrong."*

Sebastian Vettel, on being booed on the podium.[^99]

On several occasions during the season, spectators booed Vettel. The booing was widely condemned by fellow drivers, the media and others in the paddock,[^100] and Vettel later revealed that it had a negative impact on him.[^99]

For the [2014](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Formula_One_World_Championship "2014 Formula One World Championship") season and beyond, drivers picked a unique car number to use for the remainder of their Formula One career; Vettel chose the number five. However, as reigning World Drivers' Champion, he carried number one throughout the season.[^101] Webber left the sport and was replaced by [Daniel Ricciardo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo "Daniel Ricciardo"), who was promoted from Toro Rosso.

Vettel struggled with reliability issues throughout winter testing, which forced him to retire at the opening [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Australian_Grand_Prix "2014 Australian Grand Prix").[^102] Reliability problems also forced Vettel to retire at the [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2014 Monaco Grand Prix") and [Austrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2014 Austrian Grand Prix") Grands Prix. Vettel qualified on the front-row for the races in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2014 Malaysian Grand Prix"), [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_British_Grand_Prix "2014 British Grand Prix") and [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2014 Hungarian Grand Prix"), and finished on the podium in Malaysia, [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2014 Canadian Grand Prix"), [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2014 Singapore Grand Prix") and [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2014 Japanese Grand Prix"). After the [Russian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Russian_Grand_Prix "2014 Russian Grand Prix"), he had been outqualified by a teammate over a season for the first time in his Formula One career. In addition to suffering reliability problems, throughout 2014 Vettel struggled to get to grips with the [Red Bull RB10](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB10 "Red Bull RB10"),[^103] and the [Pirelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirelli "Pirelli") tyres.[^104] He signed off the year by becoming the first defending champion to fail to win a race during a season since [Jacques Villeneuve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve "Jacques Villeneuve") in [1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Formula_One_World_Championship "1998 Formula One World Championship").[^105]

In October, Red Bull had announced that Vettel would be leaving the team at the end of the season to join [Scuderia Ferrari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari "Scuderia Ferrari"), one year before his contract was due to expire.[^106] Vettel replaced Alonso and partnered his friend Kimi Räikkönen.[^107] Vettel mentioned he would like to drive for Ferrari at some point in his career and was already rumoured in 2012 to have a non-binding pre-contract, with options, to join them in 2014.[^108] He was denied an early release from his Red Bull contract to test the [2014 Ferrari car](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_F14_T "Ferrari F14 T") in [Abu Dhabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yas_Marina_Circuit "Yas Marina Circuit").[^109] In spite of this, Vettel was present at the Ferrari test – although not driving the car – but Red Bull did not enforce any sanctions.[^110] Vettel instead made his first appearance in November, completing nearly 100 laps in the [2012 car](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_F2012 "Ferrari F2012") around the test track of [Fiorano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorano_Circuit "Fiorano Circuit").[^111]

> *The next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true. When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.*

Sebastian Vettel, on his lifelong dream of driving for Ferrari

Vettel at the [2015 Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2015 Malaysian Grand Prix"), where he took his maiden win for Ferrari

Vettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the [Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Australian_Grand_Prix "2015 Australian Grand Prix").[^112] He followed that up with winning the [Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2015 Malaysian Grand Prix"),[^113] his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years. After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special.[^114]

He won the [Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2015 Hungarian Grand Prix") to remain a championship contender after he started from third on the grid. He dedicated his victory to the driver [Jules Bianchi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Bianchi "Jules Bianchi"), who died the week prior from injuries sustained in 2014.[^115] At the halfway point of the season, Vettel was 42 points behind championship leader and [Mercedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One") driver Hamilton.[^116] Vettel was in third place in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2015 Belgian Grand Prix") when his right rear blew at high speed on the penultimate lap, likely ending any title chances given Hamilton's win. After the race, he ranted about the 'unacceptable' and 'unsafe' Pirelli tyres that could have caused him serious injury.[^117]

Vettel came home second in the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Italian_Grand_Prix "2015 Italian Grand Prix"), his first race with Ferrari at the team's home soil.[^118] He then took his first pole with the team at the [Singapore Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2015 Singapore Grand Prix"),[^119] Ferrari's first pole for three years. Vettel went on to win the race, and with Hamilton retiring, he closed to within 49 points with seven races remaining.[^120] Vettel ended the season in third place, however, with three wins and 13 podiums; he declared the season as a 'miracle'.[^121]

After a third-place finish at the [2016 Australian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Australian_Grand_Prix "2016 Australian Grand Prix"),[^122] Vettel's participation in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2016 Bahrain Grand Prix") ended without starting as his car broke down on the formation lap.[^123] At the [Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2016 Chinese Grand Prix"), Vettel collided with teammate Räikkönen on the first lap, but both were able to continue. He blamed Red Bull driver [Daniil Kvyat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kvyat "Daniil Kvyat") for the collision, labelling him a "madman" and described his overtaking manoeuvre as "suicidal".[^124] At the [Russian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Russian_Grand_Prix "2016 Russian Grand Prix"), Vettel retired on the first lap after two consecutive collisions with Kvyat.[^125] At the [Mexican Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Mexican_Grand_Prix "2016 Mexican Grand Prix"), Vettel attempted to overtake Red Bull driver [Max Verstappen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen "Max Verstappen"), but after Verstappen ran off the track and rejoined ahead of him, Vettel verbally attacked him and race director [Charlie Whiting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Whiting "Charlie Whiting"), for which he later apologised.[^126] Vettel then blocked Red Bull's Ricciardo by moving in the braking zone, and was given a ten-second penalty and two points on his licence.[^127] Although he achieved seven podium finishes during the season, Vettel did not win any races in 2016.[^128]

Vettel during pre-season testing for Ferrari in 2017

His [third season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Formula_One_World_Championship "2017 Formula One World Championship") at Ferrari started with victory in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Australian_Grand_Prix "2017 Australian Grand Prix"), his first in 18 months.[^129] The early form continued the following races, winning in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2017 Bahrain Grand Prix") and [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2017 Monaco Grand Prix"),[^130] [^131] and finishing second in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2017 Chinese Grand Prix"), [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Russian_Grand_Prix "2017 Russian Grand Prix") and [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2017 Spanish Grand Prix").[^132] In Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with Räikkönen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front row lock out since the [2008 French Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_French_Grand_Prix "2008 French Grand Prix").[^133] Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in [2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2001 Monaco Grand Prix").[^131]

In [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), Vettel collided into the rear of race leader Hamilton under the safety car, accusing Hamilton of brake testing him.[^134] Moments later, Vettel pulled alongside and hit his Mercedes as they prepared for a restart, for which he received a ten-second stop-go penalty.[^135] The FIA investigated the Vettel-Hamilton incident further, but Vettel received no punishment. Vettel took full responsibility, issuing a public apology and committing to devote personal time over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events.[^136]

Vettel at the [2017 Malaysian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2017 Malaysian Grand Prix")

Vettel's championship lead was cut to only a single point in [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_British_Grand_Prix "2017 British Grand Prix"), as he suffered a puncture on the penultimate lap and dropped to seventh place.[^137] Vettel started from pole in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2017 Hungarian Grand Prix") and maintained the lead. He overcame steering issues and held on for victory, which gave him a 14-point lead over Hamilton.[^138] Mercedes dominated after the summer break and Vettel lost the championship lead at the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Italian_Grand_Prix "2017 Italian Grand Prix"),[^139] which was followed by a first-lap retirement in [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2017 Singapore Grand Prix") after collision with Räikkönen and Verstappen. It was the first time in Formula One history that both Ferraris retired from the first lap of a Grand Prix.[^140] His title hopes were dealt another blow in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2017 Malaysian Grand Prix"), as he started last following a turbo problem in qualifying. He finished in fourth place, but crashed with Williams' [Lance Stroll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Stroll "Lance Stroll") on the cool-down lap; neither would be penalised.[^141] More reliability issues befell Ferrari in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2017 Japanese Grand Prix") as Vettel retired due to a spark plug failure.[^142] In [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mexican_Grand_Prix "2017 Mexican Grand Prix"), Vettel became the fourth driver in Formula One history to claim 50 pole positions.[^143] Verstappen took the lead from Vettel at the start, before Vettel collided with Hamilton, after which Hamilton won his fourth title.[^144] For the first time in his career, Vettel failed to win the World Drivers' Championship having led it at some stage during a season.[^145]

Vettel driving past his fans at the [2018 Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2018 Chinese Grand Prix")

The [2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Formula_One_World_Championship "2018 Formula One World Championship") season was dubbed the "Fight For Five" by the media, as for the first time in Formula One history, two quadruple world champions lined up at the start of a season.[^146] For the second consecutive year, Vettel began the season with victory in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Australian_Grand_Prix "2018 Australian Grand Prix"), after he took the lead while pitting under the virtual safety car.[^147] It was his 100th podium, while he also became only the third man in Formula One history to have led 3,000 laps.[^148] In [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2018 Bahrain Grand Prix"), Vettel maintained the lead from pole through the first round of pit stops and held off Mercedes' [Valtteri Bottas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas "Valtteri Bottas") despite being on old soft tyres to take a fourth victory at the circuit.[^149] At the [Chinese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2018 Chinese Grand Prix"), he was hit by Verstappen in the latter stages of the race, which caused both to spin. Vettel limped home in eighth place, with his championship lead reduced to nine points.[^150] For the first time since 2013, Vettel took three consecutive pole positions as he qualified in first place in [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"). It was the 23rd different Grand Prix at which he had taken pole position, equalling Hamilton's then-record.[^151]

At the [Canadian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2018 Canadian Grand Prix"), Vettel won for the third time in 2018 and for the 50th time in his career, becoming only the fourth man to reach a half-century of wins.[^152] The following race in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_French_Grand_Prix "2018 French Grand Prix"), Vettel lost the championship lead following a collision with Bottas.[^153] He bounced back in [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_British_Grand_Prix "2018 British Grand Prix"), after he passed Bottas in the last laps to take victory.[^154] Vettel led his [home race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_German_Grand_Prix "2018 German Grand Prix") until he slid off the track and hit the wall in the latter stages as rain started to fall, as he had clipped the sausage curb a few laps before, breaking a part of his front wing, causing understeer and loss of downforce;[^155] [^156] he won in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2018 Belgian Grand Prix"), however, in which he passed Hamilton for the race victory.[^157] Contact on the opening lap with Hamilton in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Italian_Grand_Prix "2018 Italian Grand Prix") saw Vettel damage his front wing and drop to the back of the field, but he recovered to cross the finishing line in fourth place. It left Vettel 30 points behind the Mercedes driver with seven races left.[^158] His championship hopes were dealt a further blow as Ferrari's upgrades introduced at the [Singapore Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2018 Singapore Grand Prix") proved to be unsuccessful, making a step backwards on car development; Ferrari suffered a dip of form until the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_Grand_Prix "2018 United States Grand Prix"), where they reverted to their old package and successfully rediscovered their form.[^159] [^160] Vettel claimed his first ever podium in [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Mexican_Grand_Prix "2018 Mexican Grand Prix") but the World Drivers' Championship went to Hamilton for a second consecutive year.[^161] Although Mercedes had been the more consistent and better team,[^162] fans and pundits criticised Vettel for making too many mistakes during the season.[^163]

After showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya "Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya"), Vettel and his new teammate [Charles Leclerc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc "Charles Leclerc") headed to [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_Grand_Prix "2019 Australian Grand Prix") with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the [2019](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship "2019 Formula One World Championship") season.[^164] The opening weekend proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race in fourth place.[^165] Third-place finishes in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chinese_Grand_Prix "2019 Chinese Grand Prix") and [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix") followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate.[^166] Vettel took pole position in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2019 Canadian Grand Prix"); his first pole in 17 races.[^167] Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer caused him to run wide onto the grass. Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had returned to the track "in an unsafe manner and forced \[Hamilton\] off track".[^168] Vettel crossed the line in first place but lost his victory as a result of the penalty. After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the pit entry.[^169] At the [German Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_German_Grand_Prix "2019 German Grand Prix"), Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start in last place. During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place.[^170]

Vettel driving the SF90 at the [2019 Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2019 Hungarian Grand Prix")

In [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Italian_Grand_Prix "2019 Italian Grand Prix"), Vettel spun at the Ascari chicane and when he re-entered the track, he made contact with [Racing Point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Point_F1_Team "Racing Point F1 Team") 's Stroll. Vettel received a 10-second stop-go penalty and finished in 13th place.[^171] At the [Singapore Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Singapore_Grand_Prix "2019 Singapore Grand Prix"), Vettel won on a circuit Ferrari were expected to struggle at. For the first time, Vettel had won five times at the same track.[^172] The following race, in [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Russian_Grand_Prix "2019 Russian Grand Prix"), Vettel went from third place on the grid to first place in the first corner. However, radio transmissions suggested that the team wanted to swap their drivers, but with Vettel the quicker driver, he remained in front. Vettel retired soon after with a MGU-K problem.[^173]

Vettel took pole position in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2019 Japanese Grand Prix"),[^174] but an abrupt start off the line caused him to momentarily stop before getting away, which allowed Bottas to take the lead; Vettel was not penalized for his jump start.[^175] After running in third at the [Brazilian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2019 Brazilian Grand Prix") for the majority of the race, a safety car allowed Red Bull's [Alexander Albon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Albon "Alexander Albon") and an aggressive Leclerc to overtake him. He tried to pass his teammate immediately but the two Ferraris collided, resulting in another retirement for Vettel.[^176] He finished fifth in the World Drivers' Championship, and was outscored by a teammate for only the second time across a season.[^177]

Sebastian Vettel competing for [Ferrari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari "Scuderia Ferrari") on their [1000th Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tuscan_Grand_Prix "2020 Tuscan Grand Prix")

Ferrari later announced they would not extend Vettel's contract beyond the [2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Formula_One_World_Championship "2020 Formula One World Championship") season. Team principal [Mattia Binotto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattia_Binotto "Mattia Binotto") explained there was "no specific reason" for the decision, though both parties noted it was an amicable agreement.[^178] The season was disrupted by the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic") as the first ten races of the original calendar were either rescheduled, postponed or cancelled altogether. Ferrari discovered problems on their car following pre-season testing, forcing them to make a major redesign.[^179]

The [SF1000](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_SF1000 "Ferrari SF1000") lacked pace as Vettel finished the season's opening race in [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2020 Austrian Grand Prix") in 10th place.[^180] During the weekend, he was also given a warning for breaching the FIA's [COVID-19](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") protocols after he was seen mixing with members of his former team Red Bull.[^181] The following race, at the [Styrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Styrian_Grand_Prix "2020 Styrian Grand Prix"), Vettel retired on the opening lap with rear wing damage following a collision with Leclerc.[^182] He ended the season in a disappointing 13th place in the Drivers' standings, with a third place in [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Turkish_Grand_Prix "2020 Turkish Grand Prix") as his best result.[^183] Ferrari only finished sixth in the Constructors' standings, their worst result since [1980](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Formula_One_season "1980 Formula One season"), while Vettel's total of 33 points was the lowest in a full campaign in his Formula One career.[^184] [^185]

Vettel at the [2021 British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_British_Grand_Prix "2021 British Grand Prix")

Vettel joined [Aston Martin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_in_Formula_One "Aston Martin in Formula One") for the [2021 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship "2021 Formula One World Championship"), replacing [Sergio Pérez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez "Sergio Pérez").[^186] In his debut race weekend in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2021 Bahrain Grand Prix"), he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision with [Esteban Ocon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon "Esteban Ocon"), giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his [superlicence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Super_Licence "FIA Super Licence").[^187] Aston Martin team principal [Otmar Szafnauer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otmar_Szafnauer "Otmar Szafnauer") reported no concerns, owing to this being a very different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start.[^188] In the fifth race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2021 Monaco Grand Prix").[^189] At the following race, the [Azerbaijan Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Azerbaijan_Grand_Prix "2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix"), he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish.[^190] Vettel also finished second in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2021 Hungarian Grand Prix"), but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one litre sample of fuel required.[^191] He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll.[^192] During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes—the most of any driver—and won the inaugural [Overtake Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtake_Award "Overtake Award").[^193]

Vettel missed the first two races of the [2022 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship "2022 Formula One World Championship") in [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Bahrain_Grand_Prix "2022 Bahrain Grand Prix") and [Saudi Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix "2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix") after testing positive for [COVID-19](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19"); he was substituted by Aston Martin's reserve driver [Nico Hülkenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg "Nico Hülkenberg").[^194] [^195] In July 2022, Vettel announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[^196]

Vettel and [Michael Schumacher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher "Michael Schumacher") after the [2011 Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2011 Japanese Grand Prix"), where Vettel won his second World Championship title

Vettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the "Baby Schumi". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the "New Vettel".[^197]

Nevertheless, the similarities were marked. Like Schumacher, Vettel grew up in a small town with an everyday background—Schumacher's father is a bricklayer and Vettel's is a carpenter. Both had their first taste of racing at the Kerpen karting track near Cologne, not far from the [Nürburgring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring "Nürburgring"). Vettel began driving in his garden lapping the garden many times before he could legally take to the roads, and said his passion for cars was nurtured by watching Schumacher compete.[^198]

After winning his first championship in 2010, and being hailed as the "Next Schumacher", Vettel stated he did not want to aim for Schumacher's record after learning how hard it was to get one championship under his belt, though he would like to win more.[^199] In 2011, Pirelli director [Paul Hembery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hembery "Paul Hembery") was impressed when Vettel was the only driver to take the time to visit the factory and talk to the tyre manufacturer to gain a better insight. "The only other driver that asks us a lot of questions is Michael Schumacher. It is like seeing the master and the protégé at work." [^200]

After Schumacher was severely injured in a skiing accident in late 2013, Vettel was on hand to collect the Millennium- [Bambi Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_Award "Bambi Award") for Schumacher's life achievements on his behalf in 2014.[^201] In 2014, Vettel cited Schumacher as one of his inspirations in becoming a Scuderia Ferrari driver: "When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari." [^202]

2017 helmet design

From his karting days, Vettel worked with helmet designer Jens Munser. At the age of eight, Vettel wanted [Sebastian the crab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_\(Disney\) "Sebastian (Disney)") from *[The Little Mermaid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_\(franchise\) "The Little Mermaid (franchise)")* on his helmet.[^203] Vettel's original helmet in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo. New to Vettel's helmet at the start of 2008 was the incorporation of the red cross shape of the [Kreis Bergstraße](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergstra%C3%9Fe_\(district\) "Bergstraße (district)") [coat of arms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms "Coat of arms") on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the region of his birthplace, Heppenheim.

After switching to Red Bull in 2009, Vettel regularly used a variety of new helmet designs. Some designs were small changes to his original Red Bull design, while others were completely new designs, such as the one he used at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix: Vettel had a special white-red helmet design, with black [kanji](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji") and [hiragana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana") for "gives you wings". Several of his helmet designs also featured his team members.[^204] At the 2012 Italian Grand Prix, Vettel celebrated his 50th helmet design with a 'rusty' matte look and 50 tallies, indicating his 50 helmet designs in Formula One.[^205] Vettel started his 2013 campaign with a design in honour of [Felix Baumgartner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Baumgartner "Felix Baumgartner"), for his world record [Red Bull Stratos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Stratos "Red Bull Stratos") space jump in October 2012.[^206] By the end of the 2013 season, he had used 76 different helmet designs throughout his career.[^207]

For the 2017 Italian Grand Prix he changed the German flag stripe on his helmet to an Italian flag stripe in celebration of Ferrari's home race.[^208] Following the death of [Niki Lauda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Lauda "Niki Lauda"), Vettel wore a special helmet based on Lauda's final Ferrari helmet at the [2019 Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2019 Monaco Grand Prix").[^209] Vettel carried the German flag stripe design over to his helmet designs during his time at Aston Martin, with his final design for the 2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix nicknamed "The Final Lap".[^210]

Vettel's four championship-winning cars from top-to-bottom: [*Luscious Liz* and *Randy Mandy*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB6 "Red Bull RB6") ([2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Formula_One_World_Championship "2010 Formula One World Championship")), [*Kinky Kylie*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB7 "Red Bull RB7") ([2011](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Formula_One_World_Championship "2011 Formula One World Championship")), [*Abbey*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB8 "Red Bull RB8") ([2012](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Formula_One_World_Championship "2012 Formula One World Championship")) and [*Hungry Heidi*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_RB9 "Red Bull RB9") ([2013](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Formula_One_World_Championship "2013 Formula One World Championship"))

Inspired by American bomber pilots during [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Vettel made it a tradition to name each of his cars in Formula One from [2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Formula_One_World_Championship "2008 Formula One World Championship") to [2021](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Formula_One_World_Championship "2021 Formula One World Championship"), stating "it's important to have a close relationship with a car. Like a ship, a car should be named after a girl as it's sexy".[^211]

[Alberta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta "Alberta") Premier [Jason Kenney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kenney "Jason Kenney") called it "over-the-top hypocrisy" because Vettel's team, Aston Martin, is sponsored by petroleum company [Saudi Aramco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco "Saudi Aramco"), which he said has "one of the worst climate-emissions records in the world".[^253] Vettel agreed with the "hypocritical" label but said those personal attacks risk missing what he called the "bigger picture" of the [climate crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis "Climate crisis").[^254]
