The **Boxer Rebellion**, also known as the **Boxer Uprising**, was an anti-foreign, [anti-imperialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialist "Anti-imperialist"), and [anti-Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Christian "Anti-Christian") uprising in North China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the [Qing dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty"), by the [Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Righteous_and_Harmonious_Fists "Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists"), known as the "Boxers" in English due to many of its members having practised [Chinese martial arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts "Chinese martial arts"), which at the time were referred to as "Chinese boxing". It was defeated by the [Eight-Nation Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance "Eight-Nation Alliance") of foreign powers.

Following the [First Sino-Japanese War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War "First Sino-Japanese War"), villagers in North China feared the expansion of foreign [spheres of influence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheres_of_influence#China "Spheres of influence") and resented the extension of privileges to [Christian missionaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_missionaries "Christian missionaries"), who used them to shield their followers. In 1898, North China experienced several natural disasters, including the [Yellow River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River") flooding and droughts, which Boxers blamed on foreign and Christian influence. Beginning in 1899, the movement spread across [Shandong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong "Shandong") and the [North China Plain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China_Plain "North China Plain"), destroying foreign property such as railroads, and attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and [Chinese Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Christians "Chinese Christians"). The events came to a head in June 1900, when Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on Beijing with the slogan "Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners".

Diplomats, missionaries, soldiers, and some Chinese Christians took refuge in the [Legation Quarter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legation_Quarter "Legation Quarter"), which the Boxers besieged. The Eight-Nation Alliance—comprising American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian troops—moved into China to lift the siege and on 17 June stormed the [Dagu Fort](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagu_Fort "Dagu Fort") at [Tianjin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin "Tianjin"). [Empress Dowager Cixi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi "Empress Dowager Cixi"), who had initially been hesitant, supported the Boxers and on 21 June issued [an imperial decree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_decree_of_declaration_of_war_against_foreign_powers "Imperial decree of declaration of war against foreign powers") that was a de facto declaration of war on the invading powers. Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favouring conciliation, led by [Prince Qing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yikuang "Yikuang"). The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, the Manchu general [Ronglu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronglu "Ronglu"), later claimed he acted to protect the foreigners. Officials in the [southern provinces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Defence_Pact_of_the_Southeastern_Provinces "Mutual Defence Pact of the Southeastern Provinces") ignored the imperial order to fight against foreigners.

The Eight-Nation Alliance, after initially being turned back by the Imperial Chinese military and Boxer militia, brought 20,000 armed troops to China. They defeated the Imperial Army in Tianjin and arrived in Beijing on 14 August, relieving the 55-day [Siege of the International Legations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_International_Legations "Siege of the International Legations"). Plunder and looting of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers in retribution. The [Boxer Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Protocol "Boxer Protocol") of 7 September 1901 provided for the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers, for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and for 450 million [taels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tael "Tael") of silver—more than the government's annual tax revenue—to be paid as [indemnity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity "Indemnity") over the course of the next 39 years to the eight invading nations. The Qing dynasty's handling of the Boxer Rebellion further weakened their control over China, and led to the [Late Qing reforms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Qing_reforms "Late Qing reforms").
