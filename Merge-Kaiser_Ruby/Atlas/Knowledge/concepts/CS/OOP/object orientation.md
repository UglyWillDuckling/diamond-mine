## Introduction

### basic concepts
[[Atlas/Knowledge/concepts/CS/OOP/polymorphism]] become anything you want as long as I can still talk to you ðŸ’¬
[[Atlas/Knowledge/Knowledge/concepts/CS/abstraction]] show **only** what is important
[[Atlas/Knowledge/Knowledge/concepts/CS/information hiding - encapsulation]] hide anything and everything that you can
[[Atlas/Knowledge/concepts/CS/OOP/message passing]] a system of objects that are able to communicate with each other via messages

### let's start

we will start of by exploring object orientation via the first object oriented language
[[Atlas/Knowledge/concepts/CS/OOP/smalltalk/Smalltalk]]. Most of the important ideas such as [[Atlas/Knowledge/concepts/CS/OOP/message passing]], #polymorphism , #encapsulation come from Smalltalk, and can best be understood by studying the language and the mindset of the people that created it.
