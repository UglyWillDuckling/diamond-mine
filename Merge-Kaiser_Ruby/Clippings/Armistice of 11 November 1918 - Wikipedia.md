"Armistice of Compiègne" redirects here. For the armistice during World War II, see [Armistice of 22 June 1940](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_22_June_1940 "Armistice of 22 June 1940").

The **Armistice of 11 November 1918** was the [armistice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice "Armistice") signed in a railroad car, in the Compiègne Forest near the town of [Compiègne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compi%C3%A8gne "Compiègne"), that ended fighting on land, at sea, and in the air in [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") between the [Entente](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I") and their last remaining opponent, [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"). Previous armistices had been agreed with [Bulgaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bulgaria "Kingdom of Bulgaria"), the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") and [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"). It was concluded after the German government sent a message to American president [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson") to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared "[Fourteen Points](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points "Fourteen Points")", which later became the basis of the German surrender at the [Paris Peace Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_\(1919%E2%80%931920\) "Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)"), which took place the following year.

Third from the left is the senior British representative, [Sir Rosslyn Wemyss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosslyn_Wemyss,_1st_Baron_Wester_Wemyss "Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss"). Foch is second from the right.

Also known as the **Armistice of Compiègne** ([French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): *Armistice de Compiègne*, [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): *Waffenstillstand von Compiègne*) from the town near the place where it was officially agreed to at 5:00 a.m. by the Allied Supreme Commander, [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic")[Marshal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_of_France "Marshal of France")[Ferdinand Foch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch "Ferdinand Foch"),<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span>[</span> 1 <span>]</span></a></sup> it came into force at 11:00 a.m. [Central European Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time "Central European Time") (CET) on 11 November 1918 and marked a victory for the Entente and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.

The actual terms, which were largely written by Foch, included the cessation of hostilities on the [Western Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_\(World_War_I\) "Western Front (World War I)"), the withdrawal of German forces from west of the [Rhine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine "Rhine"), Entente occupation of the [Rhineland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland "Rhineland") and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military [materiel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiel "Materiel"), the release of Allied [prisoners of war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_prisoners_of_war_in_Germany "World War I prisoners of war in Germany") and interned civilians, eventual [reparations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_reparations "World War I reparations"), no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval [blockade of Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany_\(1914%E2%80%931919\) "Blockade of Germany (1914–1919)"). The armistice was extended three times while negotiations continued on a peace treaty. The [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles"), which was officially signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.

Fighting continued up until 11 a.m. CET on 11 November 1918, with 2,738 men dying on the last day of the war.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPersico2005-2"><span>[</span> 2 <span>]</span></a></sup>
