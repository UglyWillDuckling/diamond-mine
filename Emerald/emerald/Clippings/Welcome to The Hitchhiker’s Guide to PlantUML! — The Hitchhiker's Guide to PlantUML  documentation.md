Imagine being able to

1. share a model or diagram between all members of the team that they can all understand and contribute to and edit
2. draw diagrams like below automatically from a text description.
3. describe a system before you build it, when you’re building it, and as you maintain it into the future - keeping the description and the system current, and in sync.
4. maintain that text version in a source code repository beside the code for the system it is describing

Imagine having a diagramming tool that

1. fits with a developer workflow, and developers are comfortable using
2. enables **lightweight just-enough** [AgileModeling](http://agilemodeling.com/essays/barelyGoodEnough.html) in a way that meets [AgileModelingBP](https://tdan.com/best-practices-for-agile-documentation/18936)
3. fits with modern practices of Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery - and “everything as code” including diagrams.

Well that’s what PlantUML gives you, and more…
