There are five startup files that zsh will read commands from:

</P>

<PRE>
$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>ZDOTDIR</CODE> is not set, then the value of <CODE>HOME</CODE> is used;
this is the usual case.<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<TT>`.zshenv'</TT> is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the
<CODE>-f</CODE> option is set.  It should contain commands to set the command
search path, plus other important environment variables.  <TT>`.zshenv'</TT>
should not contain commands that produce output or assume the shell is
attached to a tty.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<TT>`.zshrc'</TT> is sourced in interactive shells.  It should contain
commands to set up aliases, functions, options, key bindings,
etc.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<TT>`.zlogin'</TT> is sourced in login shells.  It should contain commands
that should be executed only in login shells.  <TT>`.zlogout'</TT> is
sourced when login shells exit.  <TT>`.zprofile'</TT> is similar to
<TT>`.zlogin'</TT>, except that it is sourced before <TT>`.zshrc'</TT>.
<TT>`.zprofile'</TT> is meant as an alternative to <TT>`.zlogin'</TT> for ksh
fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could
certainly be done if desired.  <TT>`.zlogin'</TT> is not the place for alias
definitions, options, environment variable settings, etc.; as a general
rule, it should not change the shell environment at all.  Rather, it
should be used to set the terminal type and run a series of external
commands (<CODE>fortune</CODE>, <CODE>msgs</CODE>, etc).
