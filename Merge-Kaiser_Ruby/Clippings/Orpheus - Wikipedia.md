In [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), **Orpheus** ([/ ˈ ɔːr f iː ə s,ˈ ɔːr f juː s /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); [Ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Ὀρφεύς, classical pronunciation: [\[or.pʰeú̯s\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Greek "Help:IPA/Greek")) was a [Thracian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians "Thracians") [bard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard "Bard"),[^2] [^3] [^4] [^5] legendary musician and [prophet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet "Prophet"). He was also a renowned [poet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_poetry "Ancient Greek poetry") and, according to legend, travelled with [Jason](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason "Jason") and the [Argonauts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonauts "Argonauts") in search of the [Golden Fleece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece "Golden Fleece"),[^6] and descended into the [underworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_underworld "Greek underworld") to recover his lost wife, [Eurydice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice "Eurydice").[^7] [[Eurydice]]

The major stories about him are centered on his ability to charm all living things and even stones with his music (the usual scene in [Orpheus mosaics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_mosaic "Orpheus mosaic")), his attempt to retrieve his wife Eurydice from the underworld, and his death at the hands of the [maenads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad "Maenad") of [Dionysus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus"), who got tired of his mourning for his late wife Eurydice. As an archetype of the inspired singer, Orpheus is one of the most significant figures in the [reception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_reception_studies "Classical reception studies") of [classical mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mythology "Classical mythology") in [Western culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture"), portrayed or [alluded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion "Allusion") to in countless forms of art and popular culture including poetry, film, opera, music, and painting.[^8]

For the Greeks, Orpheus was a founder and prophet of the so-called ["Orphic" mysteries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_\(religion\) "Orphism (religion)").[^9] He was credited with the composition of a [number of works](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic_literature "Orphic literature"), among which are a number of now-lost theogonies, including the theogony commented upon in the [Derveni papyrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derveni_papyrus "Derveni papyrus"),[^10] as well as extant works such the *[Orphic Hymns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic_Hymns "Orphic Hymns")*, the *[Orphic Argonautica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic_Argonautica "Orphic Argonautica"),* and the *[Lithica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orphic_Lithica&action=edit&redlink=1 "Orphic Lithica (page does not exist)")*.[^11] Shrines containing purported [relics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic#In_classical_antiquity "Relic") of Orpheus were regarded as [oracles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle "Oracle").[^12]

Several etymologies for the name *Orpheus* have been proposed. A probable suggestion is that it is derived from a hypothetical [PIE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language "Proto-Indo-European language") root \*h₃órbʰos 'orphan, servant, slave' and ultimately the verb root \*h₃erbʰ- 'to change allegiance, status, ownership'.[^13] Cognates could include [Ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): ὄρφνη (*órphnē*; 'darkness') [^14] and ὀρφανός (*orphanós*; 'fatherless, orphan') [^15] from which comes English 'orphan' by way of Latin.

[Fulgentius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Planciades_Fulgentius "Fabius Planciades Fulgentius"), a mythographer of the late 5th to early 6th century AD, gave the unlikely etymology meaning "best voice", "Oraia-phonos".[^16]

Although [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") did not believe that Orpheus existed, all other ancient writers believed he once was a real person, though living in remote antiquity. Most of them believed that he lived several generations before [Homer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer").[^17] The earliest literary reference to Orpheus is a two-word fragment of the 6th-century BC lyric poet [Ibycus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibycus "Ibycus"): *onomaklyton Orphēn* ('Orpheus famous-of-name'). He is not mentioned by Homer or [Hesiod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod").[^18] Most ancient sources accept his historical existence; Aristotle is an exception.[^19] [^20] [Pindar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar "Pindar") calls Orpheus 'the father of songs' [^21] and identifies him as a son of the [Thracian mythological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracian_mythology "Thracian mythology") king [Oeagrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeagrus "Oeagrus") [^22] and the [Muse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse "Muse") [Calliope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope "Calliope").[^23]

Greeks of the [Classical age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece "Classical Greece") venerated Orpheus as the greatest of all poets and musicians; it was said that while [Hermes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes "Hermes") had invented the [lyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyre "Lyre"), Orpheus perfected it. Poets such as [Simonides of Ceos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos "Simonides of Ceos") said that Orpheus's music and singing could charm the birds, fish and wild beasts, coax the trees and rocks into dance,[^24] and divert the course of rivers.

Orpheus was one of the handful of [Greek heroes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_hero "Greek hero") [^25] to visit the [underworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_underworld "Greek underworld") and return; his music and song had power even over [Hades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades "Hades"). The earliest known reference to this [descent to the underworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_to_the_underworld "Descent to the underworld") is the painting by [Polygnotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygnotus "Polygnotus") (5th century BC) described by [Pausanias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_\(geographer\) "Pausanias (geographer)") (2nd century AD), where no mention is made of Eurydice. [Euripides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides "Euripides") and [Plato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") both refer to the story of his descent to recover his wife, but do not mention her name; a contemporary relief (about 400 BC) shows Orpheus and his wife with Hermes. The elegiac poet [Hermesianax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesianax_\(poet\) "Hermesianax (poet)") called her [Agriope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argiope_\(mythology\) "Argiope (mythology)"); and the first mention of her name in literature is in the *Lament for [Bion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bion_of_Smyrna "Bion of Smyrna")* (1st century BC).[^17]

Some sources credit Orpheus with further gifts to humankind: medicine, which is more usually under the auspices of [Asclepius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius "Asclepius") (Aesculapius) or [Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo"); writing,[^26] which is usually credited to [Cadmus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus "Cadmus"); and agriculture, where Orpheus assumes the [Eleusinian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries "Eleusinian Mysteries") role of [Triptolemus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptolemus "Triptolemus") as giver of [Demeter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter "Demeter") 's knowledge to humankind. Orpheus was an [augur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur "Augur") and seer; he practiced magical arts and [astrology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), founded cults to [Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo") and [Dionysus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus"),[^27] and prescribed the mystery rites preserved in Orphic texts. Pindar and [Apollonius of Rhodes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Rhodes "Apollonius of Rhodes") [^28] place Orpheus as the harpist and companion of [Jason and the Argonauts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica "Argonautica"). Orpheus had a brother named [Linus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_of_Thrace "Linus of Thrace"), who went to [Thebes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Thebes_\(Boeotia\) "Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)") and became a Theban.[^29] He is claimed by [Aristophanes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes "Aristophanes") and [Horace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace") to have taught cannibals to subsist on fruit, and to have made lions and tigers obedient to him. Horace believed, however, that Orpheus had only introduced order and civilization to savages.[^30]

[Strabo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo") (64 BC – c. AD 24) presents Orpheus as a mortal, who lived and died in a village close to [Olympus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus "Mount Olympus").[^31] "Some, of course, received him willingly, but others, since they suspected a plot and violence, combined against him and killed him." He made money as a musician and "wizard" – Strabo uses αγυρτεύοντα (*agurteúonta*),[^32] also used by [Sophocles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles "Sophocles") in *[Oedipus Tyrannus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Tyrannus "Oedipus Tyrannus")* to characterize [Tiresias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiresias "Tiresias") as a trickster with an excessive desire for possessions. Αγύρτης (*agúrtēs*) most often meant ' [charlatan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan "Charlatan") ' [^33] and always had a negative connotation. [Pausanias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_\(geographer\) "Pausanias (geographer)") writes of an unnamed [Egyptian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") who considered Orpheus a μάγευσε (*mágeuse*), i.e., magician.[^34]

"Orpheus... is repeatedly referred to by Euripides, in whom we find the first allusion to the connection of Orpheus with [Dionysus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus") and the infernal regions: he speaks of him as related to the [Muses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses "Muses") (*[Rhesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_\(play\) "Rhesus (play)")* 944, 946); mentions the power of his song over rocks, trees, and wild beasts (*[Medea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_\(play\) "Medea (play)")* 543, *[Iphigenia in Aulis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Aulis "Iphigenia in Aulis")* 1211, *[Bacchae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae "The Bacchae")* 561, and a jocular allusion in *[Cyclops](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclops_\(play\) "Cyclops (play)")* 646); refers to his charming the infernal powers (*[Alcestis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcestis_\(play\) "Alcestis (play)")* 357); connects him with Bacchanalian orgies ([*Hippolytus*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolytus_\(play\) "Hippolytus (play)") 953); ascribes to him the origin of sacred mysteries (*[Rhesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_\(play\) "Rhesus (play)")* 943), and places the scene of his activity among the forests of Olympus (*[Bacchae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae "The Bacchae")* 561.)" [^35] "Euripides \[also\] brought Orpheus into his play *[Hypsipyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypsipyle_\(play\) "Hypsipyle (play)")*, which dealt with the [Lemnian episode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnian_deeds "Lemnian deeds") of the Argonautic voyage; Orpheus there acts as [coxswain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxswain "Coxswain"), and later as guardian in Thrace of Jason's children by [Hypsipyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypsipyle "Hypsipyle")."

"He is mentioned once only, but in an important passage, by Aristophanes (*[Frogs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frogs "The Frogs")* 1032), who enumerates, as the oldest poets, Orpheus, [Musaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_of_Athens "Musaeus of Athens"), [Hesiod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), and Homer, and makes Orpheus the teacher of religious initiations and of abstinence from murder..."

He calls him the son of Oeagrus (*[Symposium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_\(Plato\) "Symposium (Plato)")*), mentions him as a musician and inventor *([Ion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_\(dialogue\) "Ion (dialogue)")* and *[Laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_\(dialogue\) "Laws (dialogue)")* bk 3.), refers to the miraculous power of his lyre ([*Protagoras*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras_\(dialogue\) "Protagoras (dialogue)")), and gives a singular version of the story of his descent into Hades: the gods, he says, imposed upon the poet, by showing him only a phantasm of his lost wife, because he had not the courage to die, like [Alcestis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcestis "Alcestis"), but contrived to enter Hades alive, and, as a further punishment for his cowardice, he met his death at the hands of women (*[Symposium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_\(Plato\) "Symposium (Plato)")* 179d)." [^35]

"Earlier than the literary references is a sculptured representation of Orpheus with the ship *[Argo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo "Argo")*, found at [Delphi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi "Delphi"), said to be of the sixth century BC." [^17]

Orpheus's genealogy

Some ancient Greek authors, such as [Strabo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo") and [Plutarch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"), write of Orpheus as having a [Thracian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians "Thracians") origin (through his father, [Oeagrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeagrus "Oeagrus")).[^2] [^3] [^4] Although these traditional accounts have been uncritically accepted by some historians,[^2] they have been put into question by others, since it was only in the mid-/late 5th century that Orpheus acquired Thracian attributes.[^36] [^37] Additionally, as [André Boulanger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Boulanger "André Boulanger") notes, "the most characteristic features of Orphism—consciousness of sin, need of purification and redemption, infernal punishments—have never been found among the Thracians"*.*[^2] Indeed, the introduction of the worship of the [Muses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses "Muses") in the times of [Archelaos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archelaus_I_of_Macedon "Archelaus I of Macedon"), the genealogies featuring [Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo"), [Pierus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierus_of_Emathia "Pierus of Emathia") and [Methone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methone_\(Greek_myth\) "Methone (Greek myth)"), Orpheus's tomb in [Leibethra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibethra "Leibethra") and the importance of this gesture as a part of the king's cultural policy, makes the hypothesis of the [Pierian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierians "Pierians"), or [Macedonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Macedonians "Ancient Macedonians"), roots of Orpheus, highly probable.[^38] [^39] The testimonies referring to his death, grave and heroic worship, for example early attestations to the existence of a real, or fictitious, gravestone epigram of Orpheus, point most strongly to his Macedonian links.[^38] Nevertheless, the Pierians were a Thracian tribe, while the origins of the Ancient Macedonians is obscure.

Important sites in the life and travels of Orpheus

According to [Apollodorus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_\(Pseudo-Apollodorus\) "Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)") [^5] and a fragment of Pindar,[^40] Orpheus's father was [Oeagrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeagrus "Oeagrus"), a [Thracian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace "Thrace") king.[^41] His mother was (1) the [muse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse "Muse") [Calliope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope "Calliope"),[^42] (2) her sister [Polymnia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhymnia "Polyhymnia"),[^43] (3) a daughter of [Pierus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierus_\(king_of_Macedonia\) "Pierus (king of Macedonia)"),[^44] son of [Makednos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makednos "Makednos") or (4) lastly of [Menippe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menippe_\(mythology\) "Menippe (mythology)"), daughter of [Thamyris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thamyris "Thamyris").[^45] Pindar, however, seems to call Orpheus the son of [Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo") in his *Pythian Odes*,[^46] and a scholium on this passage adds that the mythographer [Asclepiades of Tragilus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepiades_of_Tragilus "Asclepiades of Tragilus") considered Orpheus to be the son of Apollo and Calliope.[^47] According to [Tzetzes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tzetzes "John Tzetzes"), he was from [Bisaltia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisaltia "Bisaltia").[^48] His birthplace and place of residence was [Pimpleia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimpleia "Pimpleia") [^49] [^50] close to the [Olympus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus "Mount Olympus"). [Strabo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo") mentions that he lived in Pimpleia.[^31] [^50] According to the epic poem *[Argonautica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica "Argonautica")*, Pimpleia was the location of Oeagrus's and Calliope's wedding.[^51] While living with his mother and her eight beautiful sisters in [Parnassus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parnassus "Parnassus"), he met [Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo"), who was courting the laughing muse [Thalia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalia_\(muse\) "Thalia (muse)"). Apollo, as the god of music, gave Orpheus a golden [lyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyre "Lyre") and taught him to play it.[^52] Orpheus's mother taught him to make verses for singing. He is also said to have studied in Egypt.[^53]

Orpheus is said to have established the worship of [Hecate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate "Hecate") in [Aegina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegina "Aegina").[^54] In [Laconia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconia "Laconia") Orpheus is said to have brought the worship of [Demeter Chthonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter_Chthonia "Demeter Chthonia") [^55] and that of the Κόρες Σωτείρας (*Kóres Sōteíras*; 'Saviour Maidens').[^56] Also in [Taygetos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taygetus "Taygetus") a wooden image of Orpheus was said to have been kept by [Pelasgians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelasgians "Pelasgians") in the sanctuary of the Eleusinian Demeter.[^57]

According to [Diodorus Siculus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus "Diodorus Siculus"), [Musaeus of Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_of_Athens "Musaeus of Athens") was the son of Orpheus.[^58]

Cave of Orpheus's oracle in Antissa, Lesbos

The *[Argonautica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica "Argonautica")* (Ἀργοναυτικά) is a [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_literature "Greek literature") [epic poem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poem "Epic poem") written by [Apollonius Rhodius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Rhodes "Apollonius of Rhodes") in the 3rd century BC. Orpheus took part in this adventure and used his skills to aid his companions. [Chiron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron "Chiron") told Jason that without the aid of Orpheus, the [Argonauts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonauts "Argonauts") would never be able to pass the [Sirens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_\(mythology\) "Siren (mythology)") —the same Sirens encountered by [Odysseus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus "Odysseus") in [Homer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer") 's epic poem the *[Odyssey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey "Odyssey")*. The Sirens lived on three small, rocky islands called [Sirenum scopuli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirenum_scopuli "Sirenum scopuli") and sang beautiful songs that enticed sailors to come to them, which resulted in the crashing of their ships into the islands. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his [lyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyre "Lyre") and played music that was louder and more beautiful, drowning out the Sirens' bewitching songs. According to 3rd century BC [Hellenistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic "Hellenistic") [elegiac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegiac "Elegiac") poet [Phanocles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanocles "Phanocles"), Orpheus loved the young Argonaut [Calais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreads "Boreads"), "the son of Boreas, with all his heart, and went often in shaded groves still singing of his desire, nor was his heart at rest. But always, sleepless cares wasted his spirits as he looked at fresh Calais." [^59] [^60]

*Orpheus with the lyre and surrounded by beasts* ([Byzantine & Christian Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_%26_Christian_Museum "Byzantine & Christian Museum"), Athens)

The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of his wife [Eurydice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice "Eurydice") (sometimes referred to as Euridice and also known as Argiope). While walking among her people, the [Cicones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicones "Cicones"), in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a [satyr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr "Satyr"). In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of [vipers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper "Viper") and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the [nymphs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph "Nymph") and gods wept. On their advice, Orpheus traveled to the [underworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld "Underworld"). His music softened the hearts of [Hades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades "Hades") and [Persephone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone "Persephone"), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her and [not look back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo#In_religion_and_mythology "Taboo") until they both had reached the upper world. Orpheus set off with Eurydice following; however, as soon as he had reached the upper world, he immediately turned to look at her, forgetting in his eagerness that both of them needed to be in the upper world for the condition to be met. As Eurydice had not yet crossed into the upper world, she vanished for the second time, this time forever.

The story in this form belongs to the time of [Virgil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil "Virgil"), who first introduces the name of [Aristaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristaeus "Aristaeus") (by the time of Virgil's *[Georgics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgics "Georgics")*, the myth has Aristaeus chasing Eurydice when she was bitten by a serpent) and the tragic outcome.[^61] Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus's visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to [Phaedrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_\(Athenian\) "Phaedrus (Athenian)") in [Plato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") 's *[Symposium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_\(Plato\) "Symposium (Plato)")*,[^62] the infernal gods only "presented an apparition" of Eurydice to him. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward, as instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he instead mocked the gods by trying to go to [Hades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_underworld "Greek underworld") to bring her back alive. Since his love was not "true"—he did not want to die for love—he was actually punished by the gods, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld, and then by being killed by women.

Virgil wrote in his poem that [Dryads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryads "Dryads") wept from [Epirus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orithyia "Orithyia") and [Hebrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritsa "Maritsa") up to the land of the [Getae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getae "Getae") (north east [Danube valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube_valley "Danube valley")) and even describes him wandering into [Hyperborea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea "Hyperborea") and [Tanais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanais "Tanais") (ancient Greek city in the [Don river delta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_\(river\) "Don (river)")) [^64] due to his grief.

The story of Eurydice may actually be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name *Eurudike* ("she whose justice extends widely") recalls cult-titles attached to [Persephone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone "Persephone"). According to the theories of poet [Robert Graves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves "Robert Graves"), the myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend, in which he travels to [Tartarus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus "Tartarus") and charms the goddess [Hecate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate "Hecate").[^65]

The myth theme of not looking back, an essential precaution in [Jason](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason "Jason") 's raising of [chthonic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic "Chthonic") [Brimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimo "Brimo") [Hekate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate "Hecate") under [Medea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea "Medea") 's guidance,[^66] is reflected in the Biblical story of [Lot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot_\(Biblical\) "Lot (Biblical)") 's wife when escaping from [Sodom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah "Sodom and Gomorrah"). More directly, the story of Orpheus is similar to the ancient Greek tales of Persephone captured by Hades and similar stories of [Adonis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis "Adonis") captive in the underworld. However, the developed form of the Orpheus myth was entwined with the Orphic mystery cults and, later in Rome, with the development of [Mithraism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism "Mithraism") and the cult of [Sol Invictus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus "Sol Invictus").

According to a [Late Antique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antique "Late Antique") summary of [Aeschylus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschylus "Aeschylus") 's lost play *Bassarids*, Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except [Apollo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo"). One early morning he went to the oracle of [Dionysus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus") at [Mount Pangaion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pangaion "Mount Pangaion") [^67] to salute his god at dawn, but was ripped to shreds by Thracian [Maenads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad "Maenad") for not honoring his previous patron (Dionysus) and was buried in [Pieria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieria_\(regional_unit\) "Pieria (regional unit)").[^27] [^68]

> But having gone down into Hades because of his wife and seeing what sort of things were there, he did not continue to worship Dionysus, because of whom he was famous, but he thought [Helios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios "Helios") to be the greatest of the gods, Helios whom he also addressed as Apollo. Rousing himself each night toward dawn and climbing the mountain called Pangaion, he would await the Sun's rising, so that he might see it first. Therefore, Dionysus, being angry with him, sent the [Bassarides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassarids "Bassarids"), as [Aeschylus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschylus "Aeschylus") the tragedian says; they tore him apart and scattered the limbs.[^69]

*Thracian Girl Carrying the Head of Orpheus on His Lyre* (1865) by [Gustave Moreau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Moreau "Gustave Moreau")

Here his death is analogous with that of [Pentheus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentheus "Pentheus"), who was also torn to pieces by Maenads; and it has been speculated that the Orphic mystery cult regarded Orpheus as a parallel figure to or even an incarnation of Dionysus.[^70] Both made similar journeys into Hades, and [Dionysus-Zagreus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreus "Zagreus") suffered an identical death.[^71] [Pausanias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_\(geographer\) "Pausanias (geographer)") writes that Orpheus was buried in [Dion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion,_Pieria "Dion, Pieria") and that he met his death there.[^72] He writes that the river [Helicon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicon_\(river\) "Helicon (river)") sank underground when the women that killed Orpheus tried to wash off their blood-stained hands in its waters.[^73] Other legends claim that Orpheus became a follower of [Dionysus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus") and spread his cult across the land. In this version of the legend, it is said that Orpheus was torn to shreds by the women of [Thrace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace "Thrace") for his inattention.[^74]

[Ovid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid "Ovid") recounts that Orpheus

> had abstained from the love of women, either because things ended badly for him, or because he had sworn to do so. Yet, many felt a desire to be joined with the poet, and many grieved at rejection. Indeed, he was the first of the Thracian people to transfer his affection to young boys and enjoy their brief springtime, and early flowering this side of manhood.

*Death of Orpheus* (1494) by [Albrecht Dürer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer "Albrecht Dürer")

His head, still singing mournful songs, floated along with his lyre down the River [Hebrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritsa "Maritsa") into the sea, after which the winds and waves carried them to the island of [Lesbos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbos "Lesbos"),[^78] at the city of [Methymna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methymna "Methymna"); there, the inhabitants buried his head and a shrine was built in his honour near [Antissa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antissa "Antissa");[^79] there his oracle prophesied, until it was silenced by Apollo.[^80] In addition to the people of Lesbos, Greeks from [Ionia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionia "Ionia") and [Aetolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolia "Aetolia") consulted the oracle, and his reputation spread as far as [Babylon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon "Babylon").[^81]

Orpheus's [lyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyre "Lyre") was carried to heaven by the [Muses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse "Muse"), and was placed [among the stars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra "Lyra"). The Muses also gathered up the fragments of his body and buried them at [Leibethra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibethra "Leibethra") [^82] below [Mount Olympus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus "Mount Olympus"), where the [nightingales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightingale "Nightingale") sang over his grave. After the river [Sys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sys&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sys (page does not exist)") flooded [^83] Leibethra, the Macedonians took his bones to [Dion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion,_Greece "Dion, Greece"). Orpheus's soul returned to the underworld, to the fields of the Blessed, where he was reunited at last with his beloved Eurydice.

Another legend places his tomb at Dion,[^67] near [Pydna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pydna "Pydna") in [Macedon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon "Macedon"). In another version of the myth, Orpheus travels to [Aornum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aornum "Aornum") in [Thesprotia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesprotia "Thesprotia"), [Epirus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirus "Epirus") to an old oracle for the dead. In the end Orpheus commits suicide from his grief unable to find Eurydice.[^84]

"Others said that he was the victim of a thunderbolt." [^85]

*Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus* (1900) by [John William Waterhouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Waterhouse "John William Waterhouse")

On the writings of Orpheus, [Freeman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Freeman_\(classicist\) "Kathleen Freeman (classicist)"), in the 1946 edition of *The Pre- Socratic Philosophers* writes:[^86]

> In the fifth and fourth centuries BC, there existed a collection of [hexametric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexameter "Hexameter") poems known as [Orphic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic_literature "Orphic literature"), which were the accepted authority of those who followed the Orphic way of life, and were by them attributed to Orpheus himself. [Plato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") several times quotes lines from this collection; he refers in the *[Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_\(Plato\) "Republic (Plato)")* to a "mass of books of [Musaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_of_Athens "Musaeus of Athens") and Orpheus", and in the *[Laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_\(dialogue\) "Laws (dialogue)")* to the hymns of [Thamyris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thamyris "Thamyris") and Orpheus, while in the *[Ion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_\(dialogue\) "Ion (dialogue)")* he groups Orpheus with Musaeus and [Homer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer") as the source of inspiration of epic poets and elocutionists. [Euripides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides "Euripides") in the *[Hippolytus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolytus_\(play\) "Hippolytus (play)")* makes [Theseus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus "Theseus") speak of the "turgid outpourings of many treatises", which have led his son to follow Orpheus and adopt the [Bacchic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchic_mysteries "Bacchic mysteries") religion. [Alexis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_\(poet\) "Alexis (poet)"), the fourth century comic poet, depicting Linus offering a choice of books to [Heracles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles "Heracles"), mentions "Orpheus, [Hesiod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), tragedies, [Choerilus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choerilus_\(playwright\) "Choerilus (playwright)"), Homer, [Epicharmus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicharmus_of_Kos "Epicharmus of Kos") ". [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") did not believe that the poems were by Orpheus; he speaks of the "so-called Orphic epic", and [Philoponus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Philoponus "John Philoponus") (seventh century AD) commenting on this expression, says that in the *De Philosophia* (now lost) Aristotle directly stated his opinion that the poems were not by Orpheus. Philoponus adds his own view that the doctrines were put into epic verse by [Onomacritus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomacritus "Onomacritus"). Aristotle when quoting the Orphic cosmological doctrines attributes them to "the *theologoi* ", "the ancient poets", "those who first theorized about the gods".
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> [Aelian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aelianus_Tacticus "Aelianus Tacticus") (second century AD) gave the chief reason against believing in them: at the time when Orpheus is said to have lived, the [Thracians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians "Thracians") knew nothing about writing. It came therefore to be believed that Orpheus taught, but left no writings, and that the epic poetry attributed to him was written in the sixth century BC by Onomacritus. Onomacritus was banished from Athens by [Hipparchus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") for inserting something of his own into an oracle of Musaeus when entrusted with the editing of his poems. It may have been Aristotle who first suggested, in the lost *De Philosophia*, that Onomacritus also wrote the so-called Orphic epic poems. By the time when the Orphic writings began to be freely quoted by [Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") and [Neo-Platonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism") writers, the theory of the authorship of Onomacritus was accepted by many.
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> The Neo-Platonists quote the Orphic poems in their defence against Christianity, because Plato used poems which he believed to be Orphic. It is believed that in the collection of writings which they used there were several versions, each of which gave a slightly different account of the origin of the universe, of gods and men, and perhaps of the correct way of life, with the rewards and punishments attached thereto.

In addition to serving as a storehouse of mythological data along the lines of [Hesiod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod") 's *[Theogony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony "Theogony")*, Orphic poetry was recited in mystery-rites and purification rituals. [Plato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") in particular tells of a class of vagrant beggar-priests who would go about offering purifications to the rich, a clatter of books by Orpheus and [Musaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_of_Athens "Musaeus of Athens") in tow.[^87] Those who were especially devoted to these rituals and poems often practiced [vegetarianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism "Vegetarianism") and abstention from sex, and refrained from eating eggs and beans—which came to be known as the *Orphikos bios*, or "Orphic way of life".[^88] [W. K. C. Guthrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._K._C._Guthrie "W. K. C. Guthrie") wrote that Orpheus was the founder of [mystery religions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_religions "Mystery religions") and the first to reveal to men the meanings of the initiation rites.[^89] There is also a reference, not mentioning Orpheus by name, in the [pseudo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo- "Pseudo-") -Platonic [*Axiochus*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiochus_\(dialogue\) "Axiochus (dialogue)"), where it is said that the fate of the soul in Hades is described on certain bronze tablets which two seers had brought to [Delos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delos "Delos") from the land of the [Hyperboreans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea "Hyperborea").

*Nymphs Listening to the Songs of Orpheus* (1853) by [Charles Jalabert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Jalabert "Charles Jalabert")

A number of Greek religious poems in [hexameters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexameter "Hexameter") were also attributed to Orpheus, as they were to similar miracle-working figures, like [Bakis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakis "Bakis"), [Musaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_of_Athens "Musaeus of Athens"), [Abaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaris "Abaris"), [Aristeas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristeas "Aristeas"), [Epimenides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides "Epimenides"), and the [Sibyl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyl "Sibyl"). Of this vast literature, only two works survived whole: the *[Orphic Hymns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic_Hymns "Orphic Hymns")*, a set of 87 poems, possibly composed at some point in the second or third century, and the epic *[Orphic Argonautica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic_Argonautica "Orphic Argonautica")*, composed somewhere between the fourth and sixth centuries. Earlier Orphic literature, which may date back as far as the sixth century BC, survives only in [papyrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus "Papyrus") fragments or in quotations. Some of the earliest fragments may have been composed by [Onomacritus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomacritus "Onomacritus").[^90]

The Orpheus motif has permeated [Western culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") and has been used as a theme in all art forms. Early examples include the [Breton lai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_lai "Breton lai") *[Sir Orfeo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Orfeo "Sir Orfeo")* from the early 13th century and musical interpretations like [Jacopo Peri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_Peri "Jacopo Peri") 's *[Euridice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euridice_\(Peri\) "Euridice (Peri)")* (1600, though titled with his wife's name, the [libretto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto "Libretto") is based entirely upon books X and XI of [Ovid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid "Ovid") 's *[Metamorphoses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses "Metamorphoses")* and therefore Orpheus's viewpoint is predominant).

Some [feminist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism "Feminism") interpretations of the myth give Eurydice greater weight. [Margaret Atwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood "Margaret Atwood") 's *Orpheus and Eurydice Cycle* (1976–1986) deals with the myth, and gives Eurydice a more prominent voice. [Sarah Ruhl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Ruhl "Sarah Ruhl") 's *[Eurydice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice_\(Ruhl_play\) "Eurydice (Ruhl play)")* likewise presents the story of Orpheus's descent to the underworld from Eurydice's perspective. Ruhl removes Orpheus from the center of the story by pairing their romantic love with the paternal love of Eurydice's dead father.[^92] [David Almond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Almond "David Almond") 's 2014 novel *[A Song for Ella Grey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Ella_Grey "A Song for Ella Grey")* was inspired by the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and won the [Guardian Children's Fiction Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Children%27s_Fiction_Prize "Guardian Children's Fiction Prize") in 2015.[^93]

Some, of course, received him willingly, but others, since they suspected a plot and violence, combined against him and killed him. And near here, also, is Leibethra."

This Egyptian thought that Amphion and the Thracian Orpheus were clever magicians, and that it was through their enchantments that the beasts came to Orpheus, and the stones came to Amphion for the building of the wall.

[^54]: Pausanias, Corinth, 2.30.1 \[2\]: "Of the gods, the Aeginetans worship most Hecate, in whose honor every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thracian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its wooden image is the work of Myron, and it has one face and one body. It was Alcamenes, in my opinion, who first made three images of Hecate attached to one another, a figure called by the Athenians Epipurgidia (on the Tower); it stands beside the temple of the Wingless Victory."

[^55]: Pausanias, Laconia, 3.14.1,\[5\]: "\[…\] but the wooden image of Thetis is guarded in secret. The cult of Demeter Chthonia (of the Lower World) the Lacedaemonians say was handed on to them by Orpheus, but in my opinion it was because of the sanctuary in Hermione that the Lacedaemonians also began to worship Demeter Chthonia. The Spartans have also a sanctuary of Serapis, the newest sanctuary in the city, and one of Zeus surnamed Olympian."

[^56]: Pausanias, Laconia, 3.13.1: "Opposite the Olympian Aphrodite the Lacedaemonians have a temple of the Saviour Maid. Some say that it was made by Orpheus the Thracian, others by Abairis when he had come from the Hyperboreans."

[^57]: Pausanias, Laconia, 3.20.1,\[5\]: "Between Taletum and Euoras is a place they name Therae, where they say Leto from the Peaks of Taygetus \[…\] is a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Eleusinian. Here according to the Lacedaemonian story Heracles was hidden by Asclepius while he was being healed of a wound. In the sanctuary is a wooden image of Orpheus, a work, they say, of Pelasgians."

[^72]: Pausanias, [9.30.1](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4) A more commonly accepted death of Orpheus was that after returning from the Underworld, without Eurydice, Orpheus fell into a great depression. Orpheus would only play sad music on his lyre, and took no interest in the \* [Maenads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenads "Maenads"), finding them a painful reminder of his past. Orpheus instead took romantic interest in men, which drove the Maenads to the point of insanity, and one day when they were drunk they tore him apart. Orpheus's head sailed down the river to distant \* [Lesbos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbos "Lesbos") where it there lived on with the gift of prophecy. *Description of Greece: Boeotia*\], 9.30.1. The Macedonians who dwell in the district below Mount Pieria and the city of Dium say that it was here that Orpheus met his end at the hands of the women. Going from Dium along the road to the mountain, and advancing twenty [stades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_\(unit\) "Stadion (unit)"), you come to a pillar on the right surmounted by a stone urn, which according to the natives contains the bones of Orpheus.

[^73]: Pausanias, *Boeotia* [9.30.1](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4). There is also a river called Helicon. After a course of seventy-five stades the stream hereupon disappears under the earth. After a gap of about twenty-two stades the water rises again, and under the name of Baphyra instead of Helicon flows into the sea as a navigable river. The people of Dium say that at first this river flowed on land throughout its course. But, they go on to say, the women who killed Orpheus wished to wash off in it the blood-stains, and thereat the river sank underground, so as not to lend its waters to cleanse manslaughter

[^83]: Pausanias, *Boeotia*, [9.30.1](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4) \[11\] Immediately when night came the god sent heavy rain, and the river Sys (Boar), one of the torrents about Olympus, on this occasion threw down the walls of Libethra, overturning sanctuaries of gods and houses of men, and drowning the inhabitants and all the animals in the city. When Libethra was now a city of ruin, the Macedonians in Dium, according to my friend of Larisa, carried the bones of Orpheus to their own country.

[^84]: Pausanias, *Boeotia*, [9.30.1](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4). Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead. He thought, they say, that the soul of Eurydice followed him, but turning round he lost her, and committed suicide for grief. The Thracians say that such nightingales as nest on the grave of Orpheus sing more sweetly and louder than others.

We read of this in both Plato and Aristophanes (Aristophanes, *Frogs*, 1032; Plato, *Republic*, 364e, a passage which suggests that literary authority was made to take the responsibility for the rites)". Guthrie goes on to write about "This less worthy but certainly popular side of Orphism is represented for us again by the charms or incantations of Orpheus which we may also read of as early as the fifth century. Our authority is [Euripides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides "Euripides"), a reference in the *[Alcestis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcestis_\(play\) "Alcestis (play)")* of Euripides to certain Thracian tablets which "the voice of Orpheus had inscribed" with pharmaceutical lore. [The scholiast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholia "Scholia"), commenting on the passage, says that there exist on [Mt. Haemus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemus_Mons "Haemus Mons") certain writings of Orpheus on tablets. We have already noticed the 'charm on the Thracian tablets' in the *Alcestis* and in *Cyclops* one of the lazy and frightened Satyrs, unwilling to help Odysseus in the task of driving the burning stake into the single eye of the giant, exclaims: 'But I know a spell of Orpheus, a fine one, which will make the brand step up of its own accord to burn this one-eyed son of Earth' (Euripides, *Cyclops* 646 = Kern, test. 83)."
