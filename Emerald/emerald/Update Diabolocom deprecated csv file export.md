## <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">description</mark>

The current file fetched from [[Diabolocom]] is being deprecated in favor of a new one. 
Specifically, the file path 
`/cross_channel/agent/agent log/[DATE]_agentlog.csv` needs to be replaced
`/cross_channel/agent/agent log/[DATE]_agentlog_v2.csv`
which includes structural changes. 
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The structural changes also need be taken into account and all fields to be verified and updated as required.</mark>
