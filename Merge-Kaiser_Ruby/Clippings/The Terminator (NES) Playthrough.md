A playthrough of Mindscape's 1992 license-based action-platformer for the NES, The Terminator.  
  
Remember how Bethesda saw Journey to Silius (https://youtu.be/0OtASNpg4eM), Sunsoft's take on The Terminator license, and responded with, "Thanks, but no thanks"? After turning their nose up at a bonafide NES classic, you'd assume that the company had something truly special waiting in the wings. And well, that truly special something came along after Bethesda sublicensed the property to Mindscape, who then called upon Radical Entertainment to provide what Sunsoft could not.  
  
The Terminator was one of Radical's debut games, releasing side-by-side with The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends in December of 1992.  
  
Remember how in the film, Kyle Reese beaned dogs with baseballs, sprinted across wet floors, and got electrocuted by every power outlet within a five-mile radius on his quest to save/bang Sarah Connor? Radical did, apparently.  
  
Some people - namely anyone who has ever played a video game, seen The Terminator, or has an IQ above 80 - might argue that The Terminator for the NES failed to live up to expectations. They might complain that Kyle Reese comes across as somewhat less-than-heroic when he's constantly falling to his death after clipping through platforms or bouncing like a pinball between guardrails on his motorcycle. They might complain that a single note played over and over doesn't qualify as music. They might argue that Journey to Silius is a good game, and that The Terminator is not.  
  
I see no reason to disagree with them on any of those points. If you happen to have a phased plasma rifle in the 40W range kicking around, I suggest using this cartridge for target practice.
