*Burger's Daughter* details a group of white [anti-apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid "Internal resistance to apartheid") activists in South Africa seeking to overthrow the South African government. It is set in the mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa Burger, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the [South African Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Communist_Party "South African Communist Party") (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's [internal monologue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue "Internal monologue") (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted in the history of the anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including [Nelson Mandela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela "Nelson Mandela") and the 1976 [Soweto uprising](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_uprising "Soweto uprising").

Gordimer herself was involved in South African struggle politics, and she knew many of the activists, including [Bram Fischer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Fischer "Bram Fischer"), Mandela's treason trial defence lawyer. She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family, and described *Burger's Daughter* as "a coded homage" to Fischer.[^wastberg-2] While banned in South Africa, a copy of the book was smuggled into Mandela's prison cell on [Robben Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robben_Island "Robben Island"), and he reported that he "thought well of it".[^novelrights-3]

The novel was generally well-received by critics. A reviewer for *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* said that *Burger's Daughter* is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel",[^sampson-4] and a review in *[The New York Review of Books](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Review_of_Books "The New York Review of Books")* described the style of writing as "elegant", "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class".[^o'brien-5] A critic in *[The Hudson Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hudson_Review "The Hudson Review")* had mixed feelings about the book, saying that it "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless".[^jstor3850722-6] *Burger's Daughter* won the [Central News Agency Literary Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_News_Agency_Literary_Award "Central News Agency Literary Award") in 1980.
