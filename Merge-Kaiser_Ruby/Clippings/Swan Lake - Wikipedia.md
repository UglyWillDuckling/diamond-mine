***Swan Lake*** (Russian: Лебеди́ное о́зеро, [romanized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian "Romanization of Russian"): *Lebedínoje ózero*, IPA: [\[lʲɪbʲɪˈdʲinəjə ˈozʲɪrə\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Russian "Help:IPA/Russian") [listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/e/ed/Ru-Lebedinoye_ozero.ogg/Ru-Lebedinoye_ozero.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")<sup class="ext-phonos-attribution noexcerpt navigation-not-searchable"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ru-Lebedinoye_ozero.ogg" title="File:Ru-Lebedinoye ozero.ogg">ⓘ</a></sup>), [Op.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_number "Opus number") 20, is a [ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet "Ballet") composed by Russian composer [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky") in 1875–76. Despite its initial failure, it is now one of the most popular ballets of all time.[^1]

The scenario, initially in two acts, was fashioned from Russian and German folk tales and tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse. The choreographer of the original production was [Julius Reisinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Reisinger "Julius Reisinger") (Václav Reisinger). The ballet was premiered by the [Bolshoi Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshoi_Ballet "Bolshoi Ballet") on 4 March \[[O.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") 20 February\] 1877[^2][^3] at the [Bolshoi Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshoi_Theatre "Bolshoi Theatre") in [Moscow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"). Although it is presented in many different versions, most [ballet companies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet_company "Ballet company") base their stagings both choreographically and musically on the [1895 revival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake_\(1895\) "Swan Lake (1895)") of [Marius Petipa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_Petipa "Marius Petipa") and [Lev Ivanov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Ivanov "Lev Ivanov"), first staged for the [Imperial Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariinsky_Ballet "Mariinsky Ballet") on 15 January 1895, at the [Mariinsky Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariinsky_Theatre "Mariinsky Theatre") in [St. Petersburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg "Saint Petersburg"). For this revival, Tchaikovsky's score was [revised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake_\(1895\)#Drigo's_edition_of_Tchaikovsky's_score "Swan Lake (1895)") by the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's chief conductor and composer [Riccardo Drigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Drigo "Riccardo Drigo").[^4]

### Origins of the ballet

There is no evidence to prove who wrote the original [libretto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto "Libretto"), or where the idea for the plot came from. Russian and German folk tales have been proposed as possible sources, including "The Stolen Veil" by [Johann Karl August Musäus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Karl_August_Mus%C3%A4us "Johann Karl August Musäus"), but these tales differ significantly from the ballet.[^5]

One theory is that the original choreographer, [Julius Reisinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Reisinger "Julius Reisinger"), who was a Bohemian (and therefore likely to be familiar with "The Stolen Veil"), created the story.[^6] Another theory is that it was written by Vladimir Petrovich Begichev, director of the Moscow [Imperial Theatres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Theatres "Imperial Theatres") at the time, possibly with Vasily Geltser, [danseur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet_dancer#Men "Ballet dancer") of the [Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshoi_Theatre "Bolshoi Theatre") (a surviving copy of the libretto bears his name). Since the first published libretto does not correspond with Tchaikovsky's music in many places, one theory is that the first published version was written by a journalist after viewing initial rehearsals (new opera and ballet productions were always reported in the newspapers, along with their respective scenarios).

Some contemporaries of Tchaikovsky recalled the composer taking great interest in the life story of Bavarian King [Ludwig II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria "Ludwig II of Bavaria"), whose life had supposedly been marked by the sign of Swan and could have been the prototype of the dreamer Prince Siegfried.[^lopukhov-7]

Begichev commissioned the score of *Swan Lake* from Tchaikovsky in May 1875 for 800 [rubles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble "Russian ruble"). Tchaikovsky worked with only a basic outline from Julius Reisinger of the requirements for each dance.[^footnotewiley199140-8] Unlike the instructions for the scores of [*The Sleeping Beauty*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_\(ballet\) "The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)") and *[The Nutcracker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker "The Nutcracker")*, none of the original written instruction was thought to have survived. Most of what scholars knew about information such as choreography came from gossip and reviews of the performance.[^9] However, rehearsal notes dating as early as 1876 have been recently discovered in the Institute for Art Studies in Moscow, revealing more information about what the original 1877 production may have looked like.[^10]

### Tchaikovsky's influences

From around the time of the turn of the 19th century until the beginning of the 1890s, scores for ballets were almost always written by composers known as "specialists" who were highly skilled at scoring the light, decorative, melodious, and rhythmically clear music that was at that time in vogue for ballet. Tchaikovsky studied the music of "specialists" such as the Italian [Cesare Pugni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Pugni "Cesare Pugni") and the Austrian [Ludwig Minkus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Minkus "Ludwig Minkus"), before setting to work on *Swan Lake*.

Tchaikovsky had a rather negative opinion of the "specialist" ballet music until he studied it in detail, being impressed by the nearly limitless variety of infectious melodies their scores contained. Tchaikovsky most admired the ballet music of such composers as [Léo Delibes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9o_Delibes "Léo Delibes"), [Adolphe Adam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Adam "Adolphe Adam"), and later, [Riccardo Drigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Drigo "Riccardo Drigo"). He would later write to his protégé, the composer [Sergei Taneyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Taneyev "Sergei Taneyev"), "I listened to the Delibes ballet *[Sylvia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_\(ballet\) "Sylvia (ballet)")* ... what charm, what elegance, what wealth of melody, rhythm, and harmony. I was ashamed, for if I had known of this music then, I would not have written *Swan Lake*." Tchaikovsky most admired Adam's 1844 score for *[Giselle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giselle "Giselle")*, which used the *[Leitmotif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif "Leitmotif")* technique: associating certain themes with certain characters or moods, a technique he would use in *Swan Lake* and, later, *[The Sleeping Beauty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_\(ballet\) "The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)")*.

Tchaikovsky drew on previous compositions for his *Swan Lake* score. According to two of Tchaikovsky's relatives – his nephew Yuri Lvovich Davydov and his niece Anna Meck-Davydova – the composer had earlier created a little ballet called *The Lake of the Swans* at their home in 1871. This ballet included the famous *Leitmotif*, the "Swan's Theme" or "Song of the Swans". He also made use of material from *[The Voyevoda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyevoda_\(opera\) "The Voyevoda (opera)")*, an opera he had abandoned in 1868. Another number which included a theme from *The Voyevoda* was the *Entr'acte* of the fourth scene and the opening of the Finale (Act IV, No. 29). The *Grand adage* (a.k.a. the "Love Duet") from the second scene of *Swan Lake* was fashioned from the final love duet from his opera *[Undina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undina_\(Tchaikovsky\) "Undina (Tchaikovsky)")*, abandoned in 1873.

By April 1876 the score was complete, and rehearsals began. Soon Reisinger began setting certain numbers aside that he dubbed "undanceable". Reisinger even began choreographing dances to other composers' music, but Tchaikovsky protested and his pieces were reinstated. Although the two artists were required to collaborate, each seemed to prefer working as independently of the other as possible.[^footnotewiley199141-11] At times, Tchaikovsky actually ended up turning to Alina Bryullova, a family acquaintance, for advice on how he should write music for ballet; she later recalled that due to her lack of expertise she "could give him practically no advice."[^12]

Tchaikovsky's excitement with *Swan Lake* is evident from the speed with which he composed: commissioned in the spring of 1875, the piece was created within one year. His letters to [Sergei Taneyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Taneyev "Sergei Taneyev") from August 1875 indicate, however, that it was not only his excitement that compelled him to create it so quickly but his wish to finish it as soon as possible, so as to allow him to start on an opera. Respectively, he created scores of the first three numbers of the ballet, then the orchestration in the fall and winter, and was still struggling with the [instrumentation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation "Instrumentation") in the spring. By April 1876, the work was complete. Tchaikovsky's mention of a draft suggests the presence of some sort of abstract but no such draft has ever been seen. Tchaikovsky wrote various letters to friends expressing his longstanding desire to work with this type of music, and his excitement concerning his current stimulating, albeit laborious task.[^footnotewiley199139%e2%80%9341-13]

#### Original production of 1877

The première on 4 March 1877 was given as a benefit performance for the ballerina Pelageya Karpakova (also known as Polina Karpakova), who performed the role of Odette, with *première danseur* Victor Gillert as Prince Siegfried. Karpakova may also have danced the part Odile, although it is believed the ballet originally called for two different dancers. It is now common practice for the same ballerina to dance both Odette and Odile.

The Russian ballerina Anna Sobeshchanskaya was originally cast as Odette, but was replaced when a governing official in Moscow complained about her, claiming she had accepted jewelry from him, only to then marry a fellow danseur and sell the pieces for cash.

The première was not well received. Though there were a few critics who recognised the virtues of the score, most considered it to be far too complicated for ballet. It was labelled "too noisy, too '[Wagnerian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner "Wagner")' and too symphonic."[^programme1-15] The critics also thought Reisinger's choreography was "unimaginative and altogether unmemorable."[^programme1-15] The German origins of the story were "treated with suspicion while the tale itself was regarded as 'stupid' with unpronounceable surnames for its characters."[^programme1-15] Karpakova was a secondary soloist and "not particularly convincing."[^programme1-15]

> The poverty of the production, meaning the décor and costumes, the absence of outstanding performers, the Balletmaster's weakness of imagination, and, finally, the orchestra ... all of this together permitted (Tchaikovsky) with good reason to cast the blame for the failure on others.

Yet the fact remains (and is too often omitted in accounts of this initial production) that this staging survived for six years with a total of 41 performances – many more than several other ballets from the repertoire of this theatre.[^footnotewiley199161-16]

#### Tchaikovsky pas de deux 1877

![[~/×/58de2398e5d6f0f3229a7d814299ad3f_MD5.jpg]]

[Anna Sobeshchanskaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Sobeshchanskaya&action=edit&redlink=1 "Anna Sobeshchanskaya (page does not exist)") \[[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F,_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%98%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0 "ru:Собещанская, Анна Иосифовна")\] as Odette in Julius Reisinger's original production of *Swan Lake*, Moscow, 1877

On 26 April 1877, Anna Sobeshchanskaya made her début as Odette/Odile in *Swan Lake*, and from the start, she was completely dissatisfied with the ballet. Sobeshchanskaya asked [Marius Petipa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_Petipa "Marius Petipa")—*Premier Maître de Ballet* of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres—to choreograph a *[pas de deux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pas_de_deux "Pas de deux")* to replace the *pas de six* in the third act (for a ballerina to request a supplemental *pas* or variation was standard practice in 19th-century ballet, and often these "custom-made" dances were the legal property of the ballerina they were composed for).

Petipa created the *pas de deux* to music by [Ludwig Minkus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Minkus "Ludwig Minkus"), ballet composer to the St Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The piece was a standard *pas de deux classique* consisting of a short *[entrée](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entr%C3%A9e_\(ballet\) "Entrée (ballet)")*, the *[grand adage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_adage "Grand adage")*, a variation for each dancer individually, and a *[coda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_\(ballet\) "Coda (ballet)")*.

Tchaikovsky was angered by this change, stating that whether the ballet was good or bad, he alone should be held responsible for its music. He agreed to compose a new *pas de deux*, but soon a problem arose: Sobeshchanskaya wanted to retain Petipa's choreography. Tchaikovsky agreed to compose a *pas de deux* that would match to such a degree, the ballerina would not even be required to rehearse. Sobeshchanskaya was so pleased with Tchaikovsky's new music, she requested he compose an additional variation, which he did.

Until 1953 this *pas de deux* was thought to be lost, until a [repétiteur score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur "Répétiteur") was accidentally found in the archives of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre, among orchestral parts for Alexander Gorsky's revival of *[Le Corsaire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corsaire "Le Corsaire")* (Gorsky had included the piece in his version of *Le Corsaire* staged in 1912). In 1960 [George Balanchine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Balanchine "George Balanchine") choreographed a *pas de deux* to this music for [Violette Verdy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Verdy "Violette Verdy") and [Conrad Ludlow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Ludlow "Conrad Ludlow"), performed at the City Center of Music and Drama in New York City as *[Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschaikovsky_Pas_de_Deux "Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux")*,[^17] as it is still known and performed today.

#### Subsequent productions 1879–1894

Julius Reisinger's successor as balletmaster was Joseph Peter Hansen. Hansen made considerable efforts to salvage *Swan Lake* and on 13 January 1880 he presented a new production of the ballet for his own benefit performance. The part of Odette/Odile was danced by Evdokia Kalmykova, a student of the [Moscow Imperial Ballet School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshoi_Ballet_School "Bolshoi Ballet School"), with Alfred Bekefi as Prince Siegfried. This production was better received than the original, but by no means a great success. Hansen presented another version of *Swan Lake* on 28 October 1882, again with Kalmykova as Odette/Odile. For this production Hansen arranged a *[Grand Pas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pas "Grand Pas")* for the ballroom scene which he titled *La Cosmopolitana*. This was taken from the European section of the *Grand Pas d'action* known as *The Allegory of the Continents* from Marius Petipa's 1875 ballet *[The Bandits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bandits_or_La_Gitanilla_\(Petipa/Minkus\) "The Bandits or La Gitanilla (Petipa/Minkus)")* to the music of [Ludwig Minkus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Minkus "Ludwig Minkus"). Hansen's version of *Swan Lake* was given only four times, the final performance being on 2 January 1883, and soon the ballet was dropped from the repertory altogether.

In all, *Swan Lake* was performed 41 times between its première and the final performance of 1883 – a rather lengthy run for a ballet that was so poorly received upon its première. Hansen became Balletmaster to the [Alhambra Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra_Theatre "Alhambra Theatre") in London and on 1 December 1884 he presented a one-act ballet titled *The Swans*, which was inspired by the second scene of *Swan Lake*. The music was composed by the Alhambra Theatre's *chef d'orchestre* Georges Jacoby.

The second scene of *Swan Lake* was then presented on 21 February in [Prague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague "Prague") by the [Ballet of the National Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Theatre_\(Prague\) "National Theatre (Prague)") in a version mounted by the Balletmaster August Berger. The ballet was given during two concerts which were conducted by Tchaikovsky. The composer noted in his diary that he experienced "a moment of absolute happiness" when the ballet was performed. Berger's production followed the 1877 libretto, though the names of Prince Siegfried and Benno were changed to Jaroslav and Zdeňek, with the rôle of Benno danced by a female dancer *[en travestie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_travestie "En travestie")*. The rôle of Prince Siegfried was danced by Berger himself with the ballerina Giulietta Paltriniera-Bergrova as Odette. Berger's production was only given eight performances and was even planned for production at the Fantasia Garden in Moscow in 1893, but it never materialised.

#### Petipa–Ivanov–Drigo revival of 1895

![[~/×/8b174ef8f7668a53655b7f38e6dc2a39_MD5.jpg]]

[Pierina Legnani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierina_Legnani "Pierina Legnani") as Odette (1895)

During the late 1880s and early 1890s, Petipa and Vsevolozhsky discussed with Tchaikovsky the possibility of reviving *Swan Lake*.[^18] However, [Tchaikovsky died](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky "Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky") on 6 November 1893,[^19] just when plans to revive *Swan Lake* were beginning to come to fruition. It remains uncertain whether Tchaikovsky was prepared to revise the music for this revival. Whatever the case, as a result of Tchaikovsky's death, [Riccardo Drigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Drigo "Riccardo Drigo") revised the score, after receiving approval from Tchaikovsky's younger brother, [Modest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modest_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky "Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky"). There are major [differences between Drigo's and Tchaikovsky's scores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Riccardo_Drigo%27s_Swan_Lake_score_and_the_original_Tchaikovsky_score "Comparison of Riccardo Drigo's Swan Lake score and the original Tchaikovsky score"). Today, it is Drigo's revision, and not Tchaikovsky's original score of 1877, that most ballet companies use.

![[~/×/11e341049ea7bd0f51c1f0a74c643921_MD5.jpg]]

[Pavel Gerdt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Gerdt "Pavel Gerdt") as Prince Siegfried (Mariinsky Theatre, 1895)

In February 1894, two memorial concerts planned by Vsevolozhsky were given in honor of Tchaikovsky. The production included the second act of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by [Lev Ivanov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Ivanov "Lev Ivanov"), Second Balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. The turnout for the revival concert was not as great as anticipated due to the mixed program as well as higher-than-usual ticket prices, leaving the theater hall half-empty. Despite the small audience, Ivanov's choreography for the memorial concert was unanimously praised by critics, and audiences received the concert with praise.[^20]

The revival of *Swan Lake* was planned for [Pierina Legnani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierina_Legnani "Pierina Legnani")'s benefit performance in the 1894–1895 season. The death of [Tsar Alexander III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia "Alexander III of Russia") on 1 November 1894 and the ensuing period of official mourning brought all ballet performances and rehearsals to a close for some time, and as a result all efforts could be concentrated on the pre-production of the full revival of *Swan Lake*. Ivanov and Petipa collaborated on the production, with Ivanov retaining his dances for the second act while choreographing the fourth, with Petipa staging the first and third acts.

Modest Tchaikovsky was called upon to make changes to the ballet's libretto, including the character of Odette changing from a fairy swan-maiden into a cursed mortal woman, the ballet's villain changing from Odette's stepmother to the magician von Rothbart, and the ballet's finale: instead of the lovers simply drowning at the hand of Odette's stepmother as in the original 1877 scenario, Odette dies by drowning herself, with Prince Siegfried choosing to die as well, rather than live without her, and soon the lovers' spirits are reunited in an *[apotheosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotheosis "Apotheosis")*.[^footnotewiley1991248-21] Aside from the revision of the libretto the ballet was changed from four acts to three—with act 2 becoming act 1, scene 2.

All was ready by the beginning of 1895 and the ballet had its première on 27 January. Pierina Legnani danced Odette/Odile, with [Pavel Gerdt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Gerdt "Pavel Gerdt") as Prince Siegfried, Alexei Bulgakov as Rothbart, and Alexander Oblakov as Benno. Most of the reviews in the St. Petersburg newspapers were positive.

Unlike the première of *The Sleeping Beauty*, *Swan Lake* did not dominate the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre in its first season. It was given only sixteen performances between the première and the 1895–1896 season, and was not performed at all in 1897. Even more surprising, the ballet was performed only four times in 1898 and 1899. The ballet belonged solely to Legnani until she left St. Petersburg for her native Italy in 1901. After her departure, the ballet was taken over by [Mathilde Kschessinskaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathilde_Kschessinskaya "Mathilde Kschessinskaya"), who was as much celebrated in the rôle as was her Italian predecessor.

A 2008 production at the [Royal Swedish Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Opera "Royal Swedish Opera")

Throughout the performance history of *Swan Lake*, the 1895 edition has served as the version on which most stagings have been based. Nearly every balletmaster or choreographer who has re-staged Swan Lake has made modifications to the ballet's scenario, while still maintaining much of the traditional choreography for the dances, which is regarded as virtually sacrosanct. Likewise, over time the rôle of Siegfried has become more prominent, due largely to the evolution of ballet technique.

In 1922, [Finnish National Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_National_Ballet "Finnish National Ballet") was the first European company that staged a complete production of the ballet. By the time Swan Lake premiered in [Helsinki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki "Helsinki") in 1922, it had only ever been performed by Russian and Czech ballet groups, and only visiting Russian ballet groups had brought it to Western Europe.[^22]

In 1940, the [San Francisco Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Ballet "San Francisco Ballet") became the first American company to stage a complete production of *Swan Lake*. The enormously successful production starred [Lew Christensen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Christensen "Lew Christensen") as Prince Siegfried, Jacqueline Martin as Odette, and Janet Reed as Odile. [Willam Christensen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willam_Christensen "Willam Christensen") based his choreography on the Petipa–Ivanov production, turning to San Francisco's large population of Russian [émigrés](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89migr%C3%A9 "Émigré"), headed by Princess and [Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Vasili_Alexandrovich_of_Russia "Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia"), to help him ensure that the production succeeded in its goal of preserving Russian culture in San Francisco.[^23]

Several notable productions have diverged from the original and its 1895 revival:

- In 1967, Erik Bruhn produced and danced in a new *Swan Lake* for the National Ballet of Canada, with striking largely black and white designs by Desmond Healey. Although substantial portions of the Petipa-Ivanov choreography were retained, Bruhn's alterations were musical as well as choreographic. Most controversially, he recast Von Rothbart as the malevolent Black Queen, adding psychological emphasis to the Prince's difficult relationships with women, his domineering mother included.
- *Illusions Like "Swan Lake"* 1976: [John Neumeier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Neumeier "John Neumeier"), Hamburg Ballet. Neumeier interpolated the story of [Ludwig II of Bavaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria "Ludwig II of Bavaria") into the *Swan Lake* plot, via Ludwig's fascination with swans. Much of the original score was used with additional Tchaikovsky material and the choreography combined the familiar Petipa/Ivanov material with new dances and scenes by Neumeier. The ballet finishes with Ludwig's death by drowning while confined to an asylum, set to the dramatic music for the act 3 conclusion. With the theme of the unhappy royal being forced into heterosexual marriage for reasons of state and also the cross reference to the personal lives of actual royalty, this work anticipated both Bourne's and Murphy's interpretation. *Illusions Like "Swan Lake"* remains in the repertoire of major German ballet companies.
- [Matthew Bourne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bourne "Matthew Bourne")'s [*Swan Lake*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bourne%27s_Swan_Lake "Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake") departed from the traditional ballet by replacing the female corps de ballet with male dancers and a plot focused on the psychological pressures of modern royalty on a prince struggling with his sexuality and a distant mother. It has been performed on extended tours in Greece, Israel, Turkey, Australia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Ireland in addition to the United Kingdom, and has won over thirty international awards to date.[^24]
- The 2000 [American Ballet Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ballet_Theatre "American Ballet Theatre") version (taped for television in 2005), rather than having the curtain down as the slow introduction is played, used this music to accompany a new prologue in which the audience is shown how Rothbart first transforms Odette into a swan. This prologue is similar to [Vladimir Burmeister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Bourmeister "Vladimir Bourmeister")'s production of *Swan Lake* (firstly staged in Stanislavsky Theatre in Moscow, 1953) but has some differences. Rothbart in this production is played by two dancers; one appears as a handsome young man who is easily able to lure Odette in the new prologue, and the other dancer is covered in sinister "monster makeup" which reveals the magician's true self. (In the film *[Black Swan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_\(film\) "Black Swan (film)")*, [Natalie Portman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman "Natalie Portman"), as Nina, dreams this in the film's opening sequence). About half-an-hour of the complete score is omitted from this production.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
- [Graeme Murphy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Murphy "Graeme Murphy")'s *Swan Lake* was first performed in 2002, and was loosely based on the breakdown of the marriage of [Lady Diana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Diana "Lady Diana") to [Prince Charles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles "Prince Charles") and his relationship with [Camilla Parker Bowles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_Parker_Bowles "Camilla Parker Bowles"). It combined the roles of Rothbart and Odile into that of a Baroness, and the focus of the story is a love triangle.[^25]
- In 2010, *[Black Swan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_\(film\) "Black Swan (film)")*, a film starring [Natalie Portman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman "Natalie Portman") and [Mila Kunis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mila_Kunis "Mila Kunis"), contained sequences from *Swan Lake*.[^26]
- In 2010, South African choreographer and ballet dancer [Dada Masilo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada_Masilo "Dada Masilo"), remade Tchaikovsky's classic.[^27] Her version was a mix of classic ballet and African dance. She also made a plot twist by presenting Odile (the black swan) as a gay male swan rather than a female swan.[^28][^29]
- *A Swan Lake*, choreographed by [Alexander Ekman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ekman "Alexander Ekman") and composed by [Mikael Karlsson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Karlsson_\(composer\) "Mikael Karlsson (composer)"), was created for the [Norwegian National Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_National_Ballet "Norwegian National Ballet"). The first act is part dance part theatre, about the original production of *Swan Lake*, which features two stage actors and a soprano. In the second act, the stage is filled in 5000 litres of water, and features the conflict between White Swan and Black Swan.[^30][^31]

*Swan Lake* is generally presented in either four acts, four scenes (primarily outside Russia and Eastern Europe) or three acts, four scenes (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe). The biggest difference of productions all over the world is that the ending, originally tragic, is now sometimes altered to a happy ending.

Some productions include a prologue that shows how Odette first meets Rothbart, who turns Odette into a swan.

*A magnificent park before a palace*

\[Scène: Allegro giusto\] Prince Siegfried is celebrating his birthday with his tutor, friends, and peasants \[Waltz\]. The revelries are interrupted by his mother, the Queen \[Scène: Allegro moderato\], who is concerned about his carefree lifestyle. She tells him that he must choose a bride at the royal ball the following evening (some productions include the presentation of some possible candidates). He is upset that he cannot marry for love. His friend, Benno, and the tutor try to lift his troubled mood. As evening falls \[*Sujet*\], Benno sees a flock of [swans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan "Swan") flying overhead and suggests they go on a hunt \[Finale I\]. Siegfried and his friends take their crossbows and set off in pursuit of the swans.

*A lakeside clearing in a forest by the ruins of a chapel. A moonlit night.*

![[~/×/709ebab75fc3ecffb41ae826bff3cb4a_MD5.jpg]]

The "Valse des cygnes" from act 2 of the Ivanov/Petipa edition of *Swan Lake*

Siegfried has become separated from his friends. He arrives at the lakeside clearing, just as a flock of swans land \[Scène. Moderato\]. He aims his [crossbow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow "Crossbow") \[Scène. Allegro moderato\], but freezes when one of them transforms into a beautiful maiden named Odette \[Scène. Moderato\]. At first, she is terrified of him. When he promises not to harm her, she explains that she and her companions are victims of a spell cast by the evil owl-like sorcerer named Rothbart. By day they are turned into swans and only at night, by the side of the enchanted lake – created from the tears of Odette's mother – do they return to human form. The spell can only be broken if one who has never loved before swears to love Odette forever. Rothbart suddenly appears \[Scène. Allegro vivo\]. Siegfried threatens to kill him but Odette intercedes – if Rothbart dies before the spell is broken, it can never be undone.

As Rothbart disappears, the swan maidens fill the clearing \[Scène: Allegro, Moderato assai quasi andante\]. Siegfried breaks his crossbow, and sets about winning Odette's trust as they fall in love. But as dawn arrives, the evil spell draws Odette and her companions back to the lake and they are turned into swans again.

*An opulent hall in the palace*

Guests arrive at the palace for a costume ball. Six princesses are presented to the prince \[Entrance of the Guests and Waltz\], as candidates for marriage. Rothbart arrives in disguise \[Scène: Allegro, Allegro giusto\] with his daughter, Odile, who is transformed to look like Odette. Though the princesses try to attract Siegfried with their dances \[Pas de six\], he has eyes only for Odile. \[Scène: Allegro, Tempo di valse, Allegro vivo\] Odette appears at the castle window and attempts to warn him, but he does not see her. He then proclaims to the court that he will marry Odile before Rothbart shows him a magical vision of Odette. Grief-stricken and realizing his mistake (he vowed only to love Odette), he hurries back to the lake.

*By the lakeside*

Scene from act 4; [Vienna State Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_State_Opera "Vienna State Opera"), 2004

Odette is distraught. The swan maidens try to comfort her. Siegfried returns to the lake and makes a passionate apology. She forgives him, but his betrayal cannot be undone. Rather than remain a swan forever, she chooses to die. He chooses to die with her and they leap into the lake, where they will stay together forever. This breaks Rothbart's spell over the swan maidens, causing him to lose his power over them and he dies. In an [apotheosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotheosis "Apotheosis"), they, who transform back into regular maidens, watch as Siegfried and Odette ascend into the Heavens together, forever united in love.

### 1877 libretto synopsis

**Act 1**

Prince Siegfried, his friends, and a group of peasants are celebrating his coming of age. His mother arrives to inform him she wishes for him to marry soon so she may make sure he does not disgrace their family line by his marriage. She has organized a ball where he is to choose his bride from among the daughters of the nobility. After the celebration, he and his friend, Benno, spot a flock of flying swans and decide to hunt them.

**Act 2**

Siegfried and Benno track the swans to a lake, but they vanish. A woman wearing a crown appears and meets them. She tells them her name is Odette and she was one of the swans they were hunting. She tells them her story: her mother, a good fairy, had married a knight, but she died and he remarried. Odette's stepmother is a witch who wanted to kill her, but her grandfather saved her. He had cried so much over her mother's death, he created the lake with his tears. She and her companions live in it with him, and can transform themselves into swans whenever they wish. Her stepmother still wants to kill her and stalks her in the form of an owl, but she has a crown which protects her from harm. When she gets married, her stepmother will lose the power to harm her. Siegfried falls in love with her but she fears her stepmother will ruin their happiness.

**Act 3**

Several young noblewomen dance at Siegfried's ball, but he refuses to marry any of them. Baron von Rothbart and his daughter, Odile, arrive. Siegfried thinks Odile looks like Odette, but Benno does not agree. He dances with her as he grows more and more enamored of her, and eventually agrees to marry her. At that moment, Rothbart transforms into a demon, Odile laughs, and a white swan wearing a crown appears in the window. Siegfried runs out of the castle.

**Act 4**

In tears, Odette tells her friends Siegfried did not keep his vow of love. Seeing him coming, they leave and urge her to go with them, but she wants to see him one last time. A storm begins. He enters and begs her for forgiveness. She refuses and attempts to leave. He snatches the crown from her head and throws it in the lake, saying, "Willing or unwilling, you will always remain with me!" The owl flies overhead, carrying the crown away. "What have you done? I am dying!" Odette says, and falls into his arms. The lake rises from the storm and drowns them. The storm quiets, and a group of swans appear on the lake.[^footnotewiley1991%5bhttpsarchiveorgdetailstchaikovskysball0000wilepage321_321%e2%80%93327%5d-33]

Many different endings exist, ranging from romantic to tragic.

- In 1950, [Konstantin Sergeyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Sergeyev "Konstantin Sergeyev") staged a new *Swan Lake* for the [Mariinsky Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariinsky_Ballet "Mariinsky Ballet") (then the Kirov) after Petipa and Ivanov, but included some bits of Vaganova and Gorsky. Under the Soviet regime, the tragic ending was replaced with a happy one, so in the Mariinsky and Bolshoi versions, Odette and Siegfried lived happily ever after.
- In the version danced today by the Mariinsky Ballet, the ending is one of a "happily ever after" in which Siegfried fights Rothbart and tears off his wing, killing him. Odette is restored to human form and she and Siegfried are happily united. This version has often been used by Russian and Chinese ballet companies.
- In the 1966 version [Rudolf Nureyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Nureyev "Rudolf Nureyev") choreographed for the [Vienna State Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_State_Ballet "Vienna State Ballet"), Rothbart takes Odette away and leaves Siegfried to drown in the storm he created, leaving Odette in captivity.
- In the 1986 version [Rudolf Nureyev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Nureyev "Rudolf Nureyev") choreographed for the [Paris Opera Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Opera_Ballet "Paris Opera Ballet"), Rothbart fights with Siegfried, who is overcome and dies, leaving Rothbart to take Odette triumphantly up to the Heavens.
- In the 1988 [Dutch National Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_National_Ballet "Dutch National Ballet") production, choreographed by [Rudi van Dantzig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudi_van_Dantzig "Rudi van Dantzig"), Siegfried realized he cannot save Odette from the curse, so he drowns himself. His friend, Alexander, finds his body and carries him.[^34]
- In the 1988 version of the London Festival Ballet, Odette dies in Siegfried's arms, who carries her to the lake, where they both drown themselves. This breaks the curse and they are united in death.
- Although the 1969 Bolshoi Ballet production by [Yury Grigorovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Grigorovich "Yury Grigorovich") contained a happy ending similar to the Mariinsky Ballet version, the 2001 revision changed the ending to a tragic one. Siegfried is defeated in a confrontation with the Evil Genius, who seizes Odette and takes her away to parts unknown before the lovers can unite, and Siegfried is left by himself at the lake. The major-key rendition of the main leitmotif and the remainder of the *Apotheosis* (retained in the 1969 production) are replaced with a modified, transposed repeat of the *Introduction* followed by the final few bars of *No. 10*/*No. 14*, closing the ballet on a downer.
- In a version which has an ending very close to the 1895 Mariinsky revival, danced by [American Ballet Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ballet_Theatre "American Ballet Theatre") starting in 2000 (with a video recording published in 2005), Siegfried's mistaken pledge of fidelity to Odile consigns Odette to remain a swan forever. After realizing her last moment of humanity is at hand, Odette throws herself into the lake, killing herself. Siegfried follows her to his death. This act of sacrifice and love breaks Rothbart's power, and he is destroyed. In the final tableau, the lovers are seen rising together to Heaven in apotheosis.
- In a version danced by [New York City Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Ballet "New York City Ballet") in 2006 (with choreography by [Peter Martins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Martins "Peter Martins") after Lev Ivanov, Marius Petipa, and [George Balanchine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Balanchine "George Balanchine")), Siegfried's declaration he wishes to marry Odile constitutes a betrayal that condemns Odette to remain a swan forever. She is called away into swan form, and Siegfried is left alone in grief as the curtain falls.
- In the 2006 version by [Stanton Welch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_Welch "Stanton Welch") for [Houston Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Ballet "Houston Ballet"), also based upon Petipa and Ivanov, the last scene has Siegfried attempting to kill Rothbart with his crossbow, but he misses and hits Odette instead. She falls, Rothbart's spell now broken, and regains human form. Siegfried embraces her as she dies, then carries her body into the lake, where he also drowns himself.[^35][^36][^37]
- In the 2006 version by [Michael Pink](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pink "Michael Pink") for [Milwaukee Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Ballet "Milwaukee Ballet"), Rothbart stabs Odette before Siegfried's eyes. Odette mortally wounded, is carried to the lake by Siegfried where they drown themselves. Their love defeats both Rothbart and Odile. As in the 1895 Mariinsky revival, the apotheosis reveals the lovers reunited in death.
- In a version danced by [San Francisco Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Ballet "San Francisco Ballet") in 2009, Siegfried and Odette throw themselves into the lake, as in the 1895 Mariinsky revival, and Rothbart is destroyed. Two swans, implied to be the lovers, are then seen flying past the Moon.
- In a version danced by [National Ballet of Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ballet_of_Canada "National Ballet of Canada") in 2010, Odette forgives Siegfried for his betrayal and the promise of reconciliation shines momentarily before Rothbart summons forth a violent storm. He and Siegfried struggle. When the storm subsides, Odette is left alone to mourn the dead Siegfried.
- In the 2012 version performed at [Blackpool Grand Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool_Grand_Theatre "Blackpool Grand Theatre")[^38] by the [Russian State Ballet of Siberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_State_Ballet_of_Siberia "Russian State Ballet of Siberia") Siegfried drags Rothbart into the lake and they both drown. Odette is left as a swan.
- In the 2015 [English National Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_National_Ballet "English National Ballet") version *My First Swan Lake*,[^39] specifically recreated for young children, the power of Siegfried and Odette's love enables the other swans to rise up and defeat Rothbart, who falls to his death. This breaks the curse, and Siegfried and Odette live happily ever after. This is like the [Mariinsky Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariinsky_Ballet "Mariinsky Ballet")'s "Happily ever after" endings. In a new production in 2018, Odile helps Siegfried and Odette in the end. Rothbart, who is Odile's brother in this production, is forgiven and he gives up his evil power. Odette and Siegfried live happily ever after and stay friends with Rothbart and Odile.
- In Hübbe and Schandorff's 2015 and 2016 [Royal Danish Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Danish_Ballet "Royal Danish Ballet") production, Siegfried is forced by Rothbart to marry Odile, after condemning Odette to her curse as a swan forever by mistakenly professing his love to Odile.
- In the 2018 [Royal Ballet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ballet "Royal Ballet") version, Siegfried rescues Odette from the lake, but she turns out to be dead, even though the spell is broken. The pre-2018 versions don't have this ending, only the 1895 ending. [^40]

## Adaptations and references

In the 2020s, *Swan Lake* became a symbol of protest in Russia. The symbolism dates to the [failed Soviet coup of 1991](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_attempt "1991 Soviet coup attempt"). On August 19 of that year, as tanks rolled into Moscow, state television aired the entire ballet on loop. Communist hardliners then announced that they had seized control of the country from [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev"), whom they had arrested. [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin") responded by climbing on a tank in central Moscow and urging citizens to turn out in protest. For three days, thousands of protesters stood off the army, after which the coup leaders relented. Within four months, the Soviet Union was gone.[^npr-57][^abc-58]

In 1991, there was a tradition of interrupting regular programming by airing the ballet on loop when the government was in crisis: it happened with the death of [Leonid Brezhnev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev "Leonid Brezhnev") in 1982, while a successor was selected, and again with the deaths of [Yuri Andropov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Andropov "Yuri Andropov") in 1984 and [Konstantin Chernenko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Chernenko "Konstantin Chernenko") in 1985. *Swan Lake* thus became "a sign of political instability and upheaval."[^abc-58]

After the 2022 [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine"), public opposition to the war was made illegal. *Swan Lake* became a coded symbol of protest against the war or the [Putin regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_under_Vladimir_Putin "Russia under Vladimir Putin"). Graffiti of the "Dance of the Cygnets" appeared in Russian cities, and when the independent Russian news outlet [TV Rain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Rain "TV Rain") signed off for the last time, due to government pressure over its coverage of the war, it ended with a clip from *Swan Lake.* It has become "a sign that we are waiting for Putin to die."[^abc-58] Putin has not established a successor, meaning that "there's always the risk that Tchaikovsky's swans may dance again."[^npr-57]
