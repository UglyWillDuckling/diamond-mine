It’s true, you can teach yourself WordPress by learning as you go. There are plenty of blogs, YouTube videos, and how-to guides available as a resource.

> But is this a good use of your time?

Instead, I recommend taking a structured WordPress training course. These courses offer step-by-step training and support to help you along the way. For example, if you don’t understand something in the course you can reach out to the course creator for help.

There are many WordPress courses available to choose from. To help you, I’ve compiled a list of the best WordPress training course providers.

## Best WordPress Training Course Providers

You will find that there are paid and free training courses available. Free courses are helpful if you’re on a budget, but they tend not to offer as much support as paid courses. Whichever route you’re leaning toward, you’ll find great options in the list below.
