***Yellowstone*** is an American [neo-Western](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Western "Contemporary Western") [drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_\(film_and_television\) "Drama (film and television)") television series created by [Taylor Sheridan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Sheridan "Taylor Sheridan") and [John Linson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Linson "John Linson") for [Paramount Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Network "Paramount Network"). The series premiered on June 20, 2018, and ended on December 15, 2024, after five seasons consisting of 53 episodes. It stars [Kevin Costner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner "Kevin Costner"), [Luke Grimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Grimes "Luke Grimes"), [Kelly Reilly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Reilly "Kelly Reilly"), [Wes Bentley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Bentley "Wes Bentley"), [Cole Hauser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Hauser "Cole Hauser"), [Kelsey Asbille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Asbille "Kelsey Asbille"), and [Gil Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Birmingham "Gil Birmingham") in main roles. The plot follows the conflicts along the shared borders of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, the Broken Rock [Indian reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation"), [Yellowstone National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park "Yellowstone National Park"), and land developers.

In 2013, Sheridan began work on the series, having recently grown tired of acting, and switched to screenwriting. Having lived in the rural parts of states such as Texas and Wyoming, Sheridan set the series in Montana and the first episodes in [Livingston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_Montana "Livingston, Montana"). Sheridan initially pitched the series to [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO"), but the network declined. In May 2017, Paramount Network announced that it had [greenlit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlit "Greenlit") its first scripted series, *Yellowstone*, and that it would be written, directed, and executive-produced by Sheridan.

The series became the first in the *Yellowstone* television franchise that includes both the prequel series *[1883](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_\(TV_series\) "1883 (TV series)")* (2021–2022) and *[1923](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_\(TV_series\) "1923 (TV series)")* (2022–2025) and the upcoming sequel series *[The Madison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Madison_\(TV_series\) "The Madison (TV series)")* and *Y: Marshals*, while multiple other spin-offs remain in various stages of development.

The series follows the Dutton family, owners of the largest cattle ranch in [Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana "Montana"), the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch (located in [Darby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darby,_Montana#Television_filmed_in_Darby "Darby, Montana")), commonly called "the Yellowstone". The plot revolves around family drama at the ranch and the bordering Broken Rock Indian Reservation, [Yellowstone National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park "Yellowstone National Park"), and land developers.[^1]

In 2013, having grown tired of acting, [Taylor Sheridan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Sheridan "Taylor Sheridan") began work on the series and writing screenplays. Having lived in the rural parts of states such as Texas and Wyoming, he set the series in Montana and went about writing the first scripts in [Livingston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_Montana "Livingston, Montana").[^2] Sheridan originally wrote *Yellowstone* as a film, pitching it as " *[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_\(film\) "The Godfather (film)")* in Montana".[^3] He initially pitched the series to [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO"), but the network declined.[^4]

In May 2017, Paramount Network announced that it had greenlit its first scripted series, *Yellowstone*. Paramount issued a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. The series was set to be written, directed, and executive-produced by Sheridan. Other executive producers were to include [John Linson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Linson "John Linson"), [Art Linson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Linson "Art Linson"), [Harvey Weinstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein "Harvey Weinstein"), and [David C. Glasser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_C._Glasser "David C. Glasser"). Production companies involved with the series were set to consist of Linson Entertainment and [The Weinstein Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weinstein_Company "The Weinstein Company").[^1]

In October 2017, it was announced that following reports of [sexual abuse allegations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_cases "Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases") against producer Harvey Weinstein, his name would be removed from the series' credits as would The Weinstein Company.[^5] In January 2018, Kevin Kay, president of Paramount Network, clarified during the annual [Television Critics Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Critics_Association "Television Critics Association") 's winter press tour that *Yellowstone* will not have The Weinstein Company's credits or logo on them, even though that company was involved in production. He stated that their intent is to replace Weinstein Television with the company's new name in the show's credits when available.[^6] That same day, it was announced that the series would premiere on June 20, 2018.[^7]

In July 2018, it was announced that Paramount Network had renewed the series for a second season that was expected to premiere in 2019.[^8] In March 2019, it was announced that the second season would premiere on June 19, 2019.[^9] In June 2019, the series was renewed by Paramount for a third season, which premiered on June 21, 2020.[^10] [^11] In February 2020, Paramount Network renewed the series for a fourth season, ahead of the premiere of its third season.[^12] The fourth season premiered on November 7, 2021.[^13] In February 2022, Paramount Network renewed the series for a fifth season, which was split into two installments.[^14] [^15] [^16] The fifth season premiered on November 13, 2022.[^17] In May 2023, Paramount announced that Costner would be leaving the series at the end of Part 1 of Season 5. The second part of the fifth and final season premiered on November 10, 2024.[^18] [^19]

The show was cast by [John Papsidera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Papsidera "John Papsidera"). In May 2017, it was announced that [Kevin Costner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner "Kevin Costner") had been cast in the series lead role of John Dutton.[^20] In June 2017, he initially agreed to one season and eventually decided to stay on for three.[^21] it was reported that [Luke Grimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Grimes "Luke Grimes"), [Cole Hauser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Hauser "Cole Hauser"), [Wes Bentley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Bentley "Wes Bentley"), and [Kelly Reilly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Reilly "Kelly Reilly") had joined the main cast.[^22] [^23] In July 2017, it was announced that [Kelsey Asbille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Asbille "Kelsey Asbille") had been cast in a main role.[^24] In August 2017, it was reported that [Dave Annable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Annable "Dave Annable"), [Gil Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Birmingham "Gil Birmingham"), and Jefferson White had been added to the main cast while [Wendy Moniz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Moniz "Wendy Moniz"), [Gretchen Mol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Mol "Gretchen Mol"), [Jill Hennessy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Hennessy "Jill Hennessy"), [Patrick St. Esprit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_St._Esprit "Patrick St. Esprit"), [Ian Bohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bohen "Ian Bohen"), Denim Richards, and [Golden Brooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Brooks "Golden Brooks") were joining the cast in a recurring capacity.[^25] [^26] [^27] [^28]

In August 2017, Oscar-nominated costume designer [Ruth E. Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_E._Carter "Ruth E. Carter") joined the production team, but soon departed at the end of the first season.[^35] Designer Johnetta Boone then joined the production crew for the start of the second season.[^36]

Principal photography for the series began in August 2017 at the [Chief Joseph Ranch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Pervais#Chief_Joseph_Ranch "Mel Pervais") near [Darby, Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darby,_Montana "Darby, Montana"), which stands in as the home of John Dutton. Filming also took place that month near [Park City, Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah "Park City, Utah"). The production used all three soundstages at the Utah Film Studios in Park City, which is a total of 45,000 square feet. The building also houses offices, editing, a wardrobe department and construction shops. By November 2017, the series had filmed in more than twenty locations in Utah, including the Salt Flats, Promontory Club, and [Spanish Fork](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Fork,_Utah "Spanish Fork, Utah"). Additionally, filming also took place at various locations in Montana. Production reportedly lasted until December 2017.[^37] [^38]

In August 2020, the series announced that filming was completely moved to [Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana "Montana"). An undisclosed production location was rented in [Missoula, Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula,_Montana "Missoula, Montana").[^39] Film locations included the Community Medical Center, Ryman Street near the County Courthouse, and a diner (Ruby's Cafe) on Brooks Street in Missoula, as well as places in nearby [Hamilton, Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Montana "Hamilton, Montana").[^40]

Filming for season 5 started in June 2022 in Missoula.[^41] In May 2023, filming Season 5 Part 2 was delayed due to the [Writers Guild of America strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike "2023 Writers Guild of America strike"), due to pick back up in April 2024.

Chief Joseph Ranch near Darby, Montana.

Filming of the "log mansion" home of John Dutton [^42] is at the main house of the Chief Joseph Ranch, which is now a [guest ranch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_ranch "Guest ranch") just south of Darby.[^43]

The house was built between 1914 and 1917 after [Cincinnati, Ohio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio "Cincinnati, Ohio"), residents William S. Ford (1866–1935) and [Howard Clark Hollister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Clark_Hollister "Howard Clark Hollister") (1856–1919) purchased 2,500 acres on the [Bitterroot River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitterroot_River "Bitterroot River") for a vacation home and formed the Ford-Hollister Ranch. Ford was chairman of [Owens-Illinois Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-I_Glass "O-I Glass") in [Toledo, Ohio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio "Toledo, Ohio").[^44] Hollister was a judge for the [United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Ohio "United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio"). Bates & Gamble of Toledo were the architects. The house is 5,000 square feet including a 2,200 square foot parlor.[^45]

The house has a [log cabin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_cabin "Log cabin") motif and was dubbed "log mansion" by *The New York Times*.[^45] It has been compared in style to the [Old Faithful Inn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful_Inn "Old Faithful Inn") which opened in 1904 and is 294 driving miles [^46] away in [Yellowstone National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park "Yellowstone National Park"). The *Times* described it as "A diverse combination of arches, gables and dormers, set off by logs placed vertically and horizontally, adds an elegance to log-home design that is seldom seen." [^45]

The complex includes three large barns built to house [Holstein cattle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein_Friesian "Holstein Friesian"). It was claimed it was the largest dairy herd west of the Mississippi River. Ford later gave up the dairy cattle and began raising [Hereford cattle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereford_cattle "Hereford cattle").[^47] After Ford died, his wife and daughter operated it as a guest house. They sold it in 1952. It went through a series of new owners who renamed it for [Chief Joseph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Joseph "Chief Joseph") who is said to have passed through its area during the [Nez Perce War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nez_Perce_War "Nez Perce War"). [Mel Pervais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Pervais "Mel Pervais"), a member of the [Ojibwa Nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe "Ojibwe"), owned it from 1987 to 2004.

The series' score was composed by [Brian Tyler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyler "Brian Tyler"). He worked with musicians from the [London Philharmonia Orchestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Philharmonia_Orchestra "London Philharmonia Orchestra") and viola, cello, and violin soloists. On August 17, 2018, the soundtrack for the first season was released by [Sony Music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music "Sony Music").[^48] The main theme melody is virtually identical to that of the 1970 hit single 'Sympathy' by UK prog rock group [Rare Bird](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Bird "Rare Bird"). Later on, Breton Vivian who composed additional music in season 1 & 2, has joined with Brian Tyler to score music for season three to five. [Lakeshore Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeshore_Records "Lakeshore Records") has released the season 2 through the season 5 soundtracks.

A teaser trailer for the series was released on February 28, 2018,[^49] with the first full trailer being released on April 26.[^50] On June 25, 2018, the series held a screening at Seriesfest, an annual international television festival, at the [Red Rocks Amphitheater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rocks_Amphitheater "Red Rocks Amphitheater") near [Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver "Denver"), Colorado.[^51] [^52] The first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2018, by [Paramount Home Media Distribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Home_Media_Distribution "Paramount Home Media Distribution") (under the Paramount Network label). After their Paramount Network premieres, CMT began reairing the fifth season on Fridays.[^53] On July 17, 2023, following the [SAG-AFTRA strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike "2023 SAG-AFTRA strike"), [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") announced that edited episodes of the series would air on its Fall 2023 schedule.[^54]

[NBCUniversal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal "NBCUniversal") 's [Peacock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_\(streaming_service\) "Peacock (streaming service)") acquired the American streaming rights to *Yellowstone* in 2020, with the first two seasons debuting in July of that year.[^55] [Paramount Global](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global "Paramount Global") President and CEO [Bob Bakish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bakish "Bob Bakish") have since called the timing of the deal "unfortunate", due to the show's improved reception, viewership, and popularity in its later seasons. Critics have noted that *Yellowstone* ' s absence from Paramount's own, similarly named streaming service, [Paramount+](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B "Paramount+") (in-spite of the show's spin-offs being produced for the service), in addition to current seasons previously being available on Paramount Network's app and website primarily through [TV Everywhere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Everywhere "TV Everywhere") (requiring a paid television subscription), have caused confusion among viewers and the show's fans on [social media](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media").[^56] [^57]

Full episodes and seasons of *Yellowstone* are available for purchase on all major digital entertainment distribution stores in the United States, with [Amazon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_\(company\) "Amazon (company)") 's [Prime Video](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Video "Prime Video") streaming new episodes in Canada the day after their American broadcast on Paramount Network.[^58] Starting with the fifth season, it will be moved to Paramount+ in Canada,[^59] and the UK,[^60] and to [SkyShowtime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyShowtime "SkyShowtime") in any territories where the service is already available.[^61] As with the previous seasons in Canada, new episodes will be released the day after the American airing.

Viewership of the series has grown with subsequent seasons.[^62] The season 3 premiere attracted 7.6 million viewers, and the season 4 premiere tallied 12.7 million viewers.[^4] The season 5 premiere garnered 12.1 million viewers.[^63] The show has been called a " [Heartland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartland_\(United_States\) "Heartland (United States)") drama" [^63] and " [red state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states "Red states and blue states") " drama,[^64] [^65] [^66] a label which Sheridan himself disputes.[^4]

Following its premiere, the show was met with a mixed response from critics. [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 54 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[^67] On the [review aggregation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregation "Review aggregation") website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), the first season holds a 56% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.8/10 based on 52 reviews. The website's critical consensus of the first season reads, " *Yellowstone* proves too melodramatic to be taken seriously, diminishing the effects of the talented cast and beautiful backdrops." [^68]

The second season holds an approval rating of 89%, based on 9 reviews.[^69] The third season holds an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 7 critics.[^70] The fourth season holds a 91% approval rating based on reviews from 11 critics. The critical consensus for that season reads, "Hitting its stride as a predictably unpredictable [oat opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat_opera "Oat opera"), *Yellowstone* continues to entertain with its tough-as-rawhide characters and modernized perspective on classic cowboy tropes." [^71] The fifth season earned an 84% approval rating based on 38 reviews. The critical consensus for that season reads, "Galloping into the arena of politics with a decidedly nonpartisan bent, *Yellowstone* enters uncertain territory but remains firmly in the saddle, with Kevin Costner's steadfast presence remaining an invaluable asset." [^72]

Native American actor [Lily Gladstone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Gladstone "Lily Gladstone") described the series' portrayal of Native Americans as "delusional" and "deplorable" in an interview with *[Vulture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_\(website\) "Vulture (website)")*. She added, "No offense to the Native talent in that. I auditioned several times. That's what we had." [^73] An associate professor of history, [Liza Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Black "Liza Black"), criticized the series and wrote that " *Yellowstone's* subtext is another thing entirely: the settler-colonial version of American history, which offers didactics on human nature rather than confronting the history of Native peoples". Black adds that "Sheridan erases the history between Natives and settlers, turning Montana into a place of brute force with no national past". She was also critical of the series' depiction of Native American women in particular, noting that " *Yellowstone* takes the historical reality and distorts it to make white women the victims."
