## Tags

Tags give a way of forming abstract hierarchies, especially when the system, like Obsidian, supports hierarchies within tags themselves, e.g. #call/work/me/very/deep/note [^1]

Using multiple tags is even better as the tag can then exist in multiple hierarchies at once.
For example, a note can be both a #tool and a #program.
## Saved Searches

Really useful for finding notes quickly without having to remember **each** [[tag]] or folder path.

The searches are available **globally** which makes them super easy to access, unlike [[dataview query | dataview queries]] which are `scoped` to a single note.
%% you could use templates to get around this issue, but what happens when you want to change something? You would need to edit **all** notes with existing `queries` %%

## [[Map of Content]]

Are [[Evergreen note | Evergreen notes]]. %% whatever that means %%

Maps assemble? the properties of both [[Folder|Folders]] and [[tag|tags]].
They are both **non-exclusive** `AND` tighly packed(grouped).

In addition, you can also **position** related notes close to each other.

One other thing that an [[Map of Content]], or a similiar feature, offer is the ability to have multiple views of the same information.

A good example would a bunch of task notes, one `query` could show the notes by priority, another one by date, and yet another one by `status`.

What MOC's provide is the ability to create **curated** list of notes that are tailored to your needs. 
What this means is that you hav the ability to create a highly customized **system** that works exactly the way you want and that your **intimately** **familiar** with.
The great thing about all this is that it doesn't happen in a day, reather, it happens over a long period of time, giving you plenty of time to design the system **you want** and become an expert in using it.
