  VoIP stands for (Voice over Internet Protocol) and refers to technology that
  allows voice communications (such as phone ) to be transmitted over the
  internet instead of through traditional phone lines. VoIP converts analog
  audio signals into digital data packets that can be sent and received over
  the internet, making it possible to make and receive calls from anywhere
  with an internet connection. VoIP services can be accessed through a variety
  of devices, including computers, smartphones, and specialized VoIP phones.
  VoIP is often used as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional phone
  service, as it can offer lower rates for long-distance and international
  calls. It can also provide added features such as the ability to easily
  integrate with other communication platforms and tools, such as email and
  instant messaging.
