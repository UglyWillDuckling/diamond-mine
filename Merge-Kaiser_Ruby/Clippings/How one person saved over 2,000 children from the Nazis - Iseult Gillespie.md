Get to know the story of [[Irena Sendler]], a social worker who saved over 2,000 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto during WWII.  
  
\--  
  
In 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska froze when they heard Gestapo pounding on the front door. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, Irena tossed Janina her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety from the Warsaw Ghetto. Who was this courageous woman? Iseult Gillespie details the life and legacy of Irena Sendler.  
  
Lesson by Iseult Gillespie, directed by Chloé Gérard.
