It allows its users to customize and **enhance the functionality of your favorite web pages**. `Userscripts` are small [[JavaScript]] programs that can be used to add new features or modify existing ones on web pages. With Tampermonkey, you can easily create, manage, and run these userscripts on any website you visit.

For example, with Tampermonkey, you could add a new button to a web page that lets you quickly share a link on social media, or to automatically fill in a form with your personal information. This is especially useful in the age of digitization, where web pages are often used as user interfaces for accessing a wide range of services and applications.

Additionally, Tampermonkey makes it **easy to find and install userscripts created by other users**. This means that you can quickly and easily access a vast library of customizations and enhancements for your favorite web pages, without having to spend hours writing your own code.

Whether you're a **web developer looking to add new features** to your site, or just a **regular user looking to improve your online experience**, Tampermonkey is a great tool to have in your toolkit.

## Features

## Easy Script Access

The Tampermonkey's popup is useful for quickly and easily managing installed userscripts. In some browsers you have to manually pin the icon to see it all the time. It allows users to enable or disable scripts, view the status of scripts, and start update checks without leaving the current page. This makes it easy for users to control the behavior of their installed userscripts and customize their browsing experience. Furthermore the **number of running scripts** is displayed as small number right at the extension icon near the address bar. ( video tutorial)

Tampermonkey's editor is OK, but you want to use your own? The solution is to enable file access and to **@require the local copy** of your script.
