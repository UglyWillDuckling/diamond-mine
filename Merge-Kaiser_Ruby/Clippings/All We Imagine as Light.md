### Academy Awards selection controversy

For the [97th Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/97th_Academy_Awards "97th Academy Awards"), *All We Imagine As Light* was not selected to be submitted by either France or India, with the former submitting *[Emilia Pérez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_P%C3%A9rez "Emilia Pérez"),* and the latter submitting *[Laapataa Ladies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laapataa_Ladies "Laapataa Ladies").* The film had been shortlisted for France's submission.[^:0-34] The [Film Federation of India's (FFI)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Federation_of_India "Film Federation of India") decision to not submit the film was unexpected, with [NPR's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR") Diaa Hadid remarking that the film's international reception had "garnered raised hopes that India might finally have a serious contender for an Oscar in the best foreign film category".[^35] Many like Naman Ramachandran of *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* drew comparisons to India's decision to not select *[The Lunchbox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lunchbox "The Lunchbox")* (2013) and *[RRR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRR "RRR")* (2022) for its Academy Awards submissions, particularly in light of the film's success at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") with it having won the Grand Jury Prize.[^36]

At the initial news announcing the selection of *Laapataa Ladies*, FFI president Ravi Kottarakara explained *All That We Imagine As Light*'s exclusion, saying "The jury said that they were watching a European film taking place in India, not an Indian film taking place in India."[^:1-37] Justifying its selection, the FFI noted on *Laapataa Ladies,* "Indian women are a strange mixture of submission and dominance. Well-defined, powerful characters in one world, a Laapataa Ladies (Hindi) captures this diversity perfectly, though in a semi-idyllic world and in a tongue-in-cheek way."[^:1-37] Kapadia responded to the controversy by expressing her appreciation for Kiran Rao's works, saying to *[Indiewire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire "IndieWire")* "I just think it’s really great that there are two films from India that are doing this well, and they’re both by women."[^38]

On December 17, the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences released its shortlist for a variety of categories, including best [International Feature Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_International_Feature_Film "Academy Award for Best International Feature Film"), and India's selection (*Laapataa Ladies*) was not selected, triggering a renewed discussion on the decision to "snub" the film.[^39] Industry figures like director [Hansal Mehta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansal_Mehta "Hansal Mehta") and [Ricky Kej](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Kej "Ricky Kej") publicly voiced their discontent with the FFI's decision to not send *All We Imagine As Light*, with the former sarcastically remarking "Film Federation of India does it again! Their strike rate and selection of films year after year is impeccable."[^40]

In light of the renewed controversy following the release of the Academy Award shortlist, [Jahnu Barua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahnu_Barua "Jahnu Barua"), the head of the 13-member all-male jury remarked to the [Hindustan Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times "Hindustan Times") that people ought to be "respectful of the process".[^:2-41] Elaborating on the decision to not consider *All That We Imagine As Light*, Barua said "The jury felt that her film was very poor technically."[^:2-41]
