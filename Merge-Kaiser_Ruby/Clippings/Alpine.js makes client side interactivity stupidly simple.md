Recently, I've been building my web application to host my upcoming course using Go, rather than using a fullstack frontend framework such as Next.js.  
  
Whilst I've really enjoyed the process, one thing that I was worried about was when it come to building client side interactivity, and I wasn't keen on having to use script tags, id attributes, or even jquery.  
  
Fortunately, it turns out, there's a simple framework that can make setting up client side interactivity both simple, and fun.
