## intro

## links and stuff

- [PR](https://github.com/MeilleursAgents/MeilleursAgents/pull/10772/commits/b25c03a0a83f6b14d26fdcc2ad7047228b3aeb75?diff=split&w=1) from [[Paulo]]
	- a quick fix to get everything working and explore the current process

## goals
- get a complete understanding of the [[Lead Fix - from estima to lead during Project init]] issues
	- need to fully comprehend what is happening and what the plan for the future is
	- what changes need to made
	- what can go wrong
	- How to test all of this
	- understand the issue on a high level, including other projects and teams
		- clarify the existing and future data structures

---
## ideas
- creating a diagram would be helpful
	- it could later be shared to improve our understanding of the process
	- the diagram could also ease the communication and store all of our knowledge(almost) in one place
- ask around  about the current process - [[Yoan]]  and [[Paulo]]
- The 2 items above could be done in `parallel`

### diagram

**flowchart**

We could start of using excalidraw and then transition to [[mermaid.js]] perhaps.


## current

started working on the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">diagram</mark> [[Process of creating a new project]]

Started refactoring the codebase in order to simplify the problem and get a better understanding of what we're
dealing with
