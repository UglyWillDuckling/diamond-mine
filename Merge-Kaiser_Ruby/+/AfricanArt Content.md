## Introducing Africa
![[SmartSelect_20241231-115105_Samsung Notes.jpg]]

There already exists a considerable literature on [[African art]], much of
it more valuable for its illustrations than its text. The most significant
studies are generally those of limited scope, dealing with the art of a
single society or area. Books and articles of this kind do not usually
have wide distribution, and the general reader sees only books (like
this one!) which deal with the art of the whole continent. Most of
these share the major characteristic of making general statements
about Africa as if this vast and varied continent were a homogeneous unit. 
Translated into statistical terms they have the effect of such
assertions as that the average African family consists of one husband,
one and a half wives and four and three-quarter children.¹ Many of
the generalizations that have been made about [[African art]], artists or societies do not have comparable danger-signals built into them, so
it is advisable to view all such declarations with scepticism.
The mere size of the African continent indicates the dangers of
generalization. Its area of twelve million square miles is more than
three times that of the [[United States of America]], including [[Alaska]]. The United
States could be superimposed on the [[Sahara]] desert and not touch the
coast of Africa at any point. Its population is about **240 millions**,
living mostly at densities below twenty-five to the square mile; it is
only in part because such vast areas are so thinly populated that it has
more distinct peoples and cultures than any other continent. Its
coastal plains are relatively narrow so that although the great rivers
are navigable for immense distances in the interior, they often plunge
off the plateaux with cataracts and rapids (the [[Victoria Falls]] on the
[[Zambesi]] are 343 feet high, twice as high as [[Niagara]], and the flow of
water over the [[Stanley Falls]] on the [[Congo River]] is twice that of [[Niagara]])
and they end up in great [[delta]]s, rather than in navigable estuaries.
Only the [[West Mediterranean]] coast affords good harbours. In conse-
quence, direct external influences, apart from the Cretan ones in the
late second millennium BC and those resulting from the Assyrian
invasion of [[Egypt]] in **666 BC** (the latter of which seems to have had
very little cultural effect in any case) were for a long time limited to
the coasts, though trade goods found their way inland. Penetration of foreigners into the interior came only after the [[Industrial Revolution]].
when Europe was seeking sources of raw materials and markets for
the finished goods. Today, with all kinds of communication in
operation, no part of Africa is entirely out of touch with the rest of
the world, and the materialistic values of Western society, which are
its easiest to export, are almost everywhere replacing the traditional
spiritual ones. African societies are changing and so are their arts,
which are reflecting increasingly, even though often unconsciously,
the new values.
Some of the most persistent stereotyped misconceptions about
Africa concern the physical environment. The entire continent is
commonly visualized as covered with jungle (a word which is never
used in an African context) or with desert. In fact, there is a gradation



from one to the other. 

**Desert** is found, of course, in the [[Sahara]], in the margin of [[the Horn]](the easternmost point), and in the [[Kalahari]] to the south. 
Yet these are not areas of bare sand; nine-tenths of them
are covered with scattered scrub vegetation. The tropical rain forest(known as 'jungle in southern Asia and '[[selvas]]' in [[South America]]) is quite limited in extent.
It is found along the West African or Guinea
Coast (with an important gap in [[Togo]] and [[Dahomey]]), [[Cameroun]],
[[Gabon]], [[Congo-Brazzaville]] and the northern part of [[Congo-Kinshasa]].
There is a separate patch of forest on the east coast of [[Madagascar]].
On the east and south of the rain forest, which as its name implies is
in the area of heaviest rainfall (more than sixty inches a year), we find
the dry forest. The forest edges everywhere grade through a forest/
savanna mosaic produced by cultivation, into a succession of savanna
woodlands, which become savanna grasslands as the desert areas are
approached. The vast area of these grasslands supports fabulously rich
resources of game in **southern and eastern Africa**, and encourages
[[pastoralism]] there and in the [[Sudan belt]]. At the extreme north and
south where there are zones of Mediterranean climate, we find
temperate woodlands. while the high mountain areas of both East
and West Africa have their own ==montane vegetation==.

This vegetation pattern, however. has not always prevailed.
Overcultivation leading to erosion has changed grasslands into
deserts, while slash and burn agriculture is establishing pockets of
savanna in the forest fringes (the forest/savanna mosaic). In addition.
there have been long-term changes in the climate. In the Ténéré, in
eastern Niger. now an extremely dry desert, remains of hippopota-
mus bone and shells of lacustrine bivalves have been radiocarbon
dated to 1400 BC±200 (Gif-76)3 and 1230 BC+ 200 (Gif-284) respec-
tively, indicating either the persistence of large lakes from earlier
times or their re-formation during a recession in the desiccation of the
southern Sahara. At the time of moister conditions before the begin-
ning of the second millennium BC the Sahara was open grassland.
supporting, as the rock art shows, large herds of cattle. At all times
the Sahara was less of an obstacle to human movement than it has
been thought to be; the trans-Saharan trade has been important for
at least the last two millennia.
Before desiccation produced the desert it is likely that the forests
were more extensive than they are now. probably spreading beyond
the areas of forest/savanna mosaic. The study of the history of the
vegetation of Africa is unfortunately still at such an early stage that
we are a long way from being able to draw maps of the continent to
show the vegetation at different times in the past. The identification
of pollen grains left in the successive layers of soil exposed in archaeo-
logical and other excavations is of crucial importance for our under-
standing of the history of man in Africa. Plants are not nearly so
adaptable to changes in their environment as animals are, so that pollen
analysis is our primary source of evidence about changes in climate,
for some plants die out and others replace them as the temperature
or rainfall changes. Human history until the latest phases is very
largely the story of man's interaction with his environment. In
many cases his art is used in ceremonies intended to control the envi-
ronment, for example, in the Bambara dance head-dresses which
represent the spirit chi wara who in the form of an antelope introduced
the knowledge of agriculture: the dances. performed in pairs by
young men at the time of planting, are to ensure germination and a
good harvest.
Modern Africa is populated by a great variety of peoples whose
ultimate origins we seem to be further than ever from discovering.

**chi wara** who introduced agriculture to the [[Bambara]]. 
These headdresses, attached to awickerwork cap, are worn in
pairs by young men of the *flankuru* or co-operating group
of farmers who at the time of planting and harvest dance in
imitation of a leaping antelope.

**Perhaps** the people who have been there longest are the [[Bushmen]] of the [[Kalahari]] desert, whose **hunting culture** appears to be very similar
to that which characterized the [[Upper Old Stone Age]]. Indeed, the
study of modern Bushmen has provided valuable ethnographic
data for the interpretation of materials found by archaeologists.
==Yet it seems unlikely that they still live their ancient way of life==
==unchanged==. For centuries they have been pushed by neighbouring
peoples into **inhospitable areas**, so that their present mode of living
probably reflects some **readjustment to a hostile environment**,
rather than the life of the Old Stone Age preserved intact. The changes,
however, are unlikely to have been fundamental.

[[The Pygmies]] too, who occupy parts of the equatorial forest,
seem to be survivors of a Stone Age population. They too hunt in the forests, though many groups have developed a symbiotic existence, exchanging the results of their hunting for agricultural produce

Face mask in the [[Segu substyle]] of the [[Bambara]].
Such masks are worn by uncircumcised boys
who have a society of their own called [[Ntomo]].
They wear them in dances during the threshing
of the [[millet]] harvest when they beg gifts of food
for the society's feast; they also beat each other's
legs with sticks to demonstrate their maturity by
not crying out.

for rain and for fertility of the fields at planting time and after the harvest. ==Butterflies appear in great swarms immediately after the first rains, at the beginning of the planting season==, so they are an appropriate motif.
