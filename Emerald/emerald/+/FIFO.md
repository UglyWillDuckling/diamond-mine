FIFO stands for for "First In, First Out." It is a method for organizing and processing items in a queue where the first item that enters the queue is also the first one to leave it. This is in contrast to a LIFO (Last In, First Out) system, where the most recent item added is the first one to be removed. FIFO is commonly used in various systems, such as computer memory, data storage and retrieval, and manufacturing processes.
