### intro
 Now we can optionally change expressions based on a condition...

 ---

### start

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string
  address: Address | undefined
};
type Address = {
  city: string
  postalCode: string | undefined
}
```

### summary 
Optional chaining adds a new ?. operator. Don't be intimidated by the unusual combination of characters! Although ?. is a distinct operator, you can think of it as: if someObject? then .property.

For ==someObject==?.property, ?. checks whether the object is null or undefined. If it is, the expression returns undefined. If itâ€™s not, it returns the value of someObject.property.

Here's another way to think about it. When compiling someObject?.property, the compiler will check: (someObject === null || someObject === undefined) ? undefined : someObject.property.


> [!MARK] chaining
> 
```typescript
users.map(user => user.address?.postalCode);
```

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Typescript</mark> will still make sure we are using valida types at all times so something like this, an assignment to a `string[]`
will not work.
```typescript
const postalCodes: Array<string> = users.map(user => user?.address?.postalCode)
```
*<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">this cannot work as the array can end up containing  values that are undefined</mark>*
