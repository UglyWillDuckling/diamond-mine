# Ideas ðŸŒ©

## next steps
1. try out the **workflow** on the page some more
	1. gather info and talk with [[Yoan]]
	2. update diagrams to reflect the new **knowledge**

![[Important#notes ðŸ—’]]
## todo's âœ”
- [x] examine the current workflow [[#examine the workflow ðŸ—ž]]
	- [x] play around with the workflow on the page
- [x] understand what the `transaction` represents
	- [x] what's the purpose of it, responsibility?
	- [x] what is **required** to create it
- [ ] examine what the `estima_processing` represents
	- [ ] where is it used?
	- [ ] how important is it?
- [ ] Think about <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tests</mark> 
	- [ ] testing more `quickly`

## ideas ðŸŒ©
- [x]  make a script to automate testing
	- [ ] see if we can easily transfer this to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tests</mark>
- [x] switch on **FE** using a query param
	- [x] enforce lead of estima ids
