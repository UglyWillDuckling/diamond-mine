One of the most useful features in any calendar app is the ability to get notifications about upcoming events. When you're busy, and don't want to be late for an important meeting, you can get an alert 15 minutes beforehand. Or to make sure you don't miss a dentist appointment, set a notification an hour before the appointment. And to plan a dinner date, remind yourself at noon, so you have plenty of time.

Many calendar apps are limited in the number of alerts or reminders you can set. Outlook only lets you set a single alert. Apple Calendar lets you set multiple alerts on the Mac, but on the iPhone and iPad, you can only set two. Google Calendar allows you to set up to five notifications.

Morgen wants you to configure your notifications as is most helpful to you. Set as many alerts as you want, so, not only will you never miss an event, but you can set alerts to help you prepare for events.

In this guide, we'll show how to set default alerts for new events, and how to set multiple alerts in Morgen.

### Before you begin

If you haven't already, [install Morgen on your Mac, Linux or Windows PC](https://www.morgen.so/guides/getting-started-with-morgen-03).

### Set **alert defaults**
- [x] Morgen - alert defaults (@[[2025-03-28]])

You can set default notifications for all new events in [[Morgen]]. Each calendar you connect to Morgen can have differing default notification settings.

To do so:

- Open the **Preferences** menu by clicking on your profile picture
- Select **Calendars** from the left menu
- Next to each calendar listed, click the ... to open **Notification** **settings**
- Change the **default** alert, add more using +, or remove all alerts using the trash icon
- Note that you can set different notification settings for Timed events vs All-day events

*You can set different notifications preferences for each calendar you have connected to Morgen.*

In the example above, you would receive a notification 30 minutes before the event starts. To change this time type a different value in the field where you see 30, or, to change the unit value, click the down arrow and choose hours, days, or weeks.

*Timed events and all-day events can have different notification settings.*

‚Äç

Morgen will use this default setting for all timed events in that specific calendar.

Do the same for All-Day Events: click + and choose when you want to be alerted. By default, this is set at 1 day before, but you can change this, as above.

If you want to add multiple default notifications, click the + icon next to either Timed Events or All-Day Events and add another alert. For example, you could have all-day event notifications 1 day before, as well as 1 hour before, so you get an alert first thing in the morning on the day of the event.

> üí° ***Tip:*** *Morgen lets you configure default alerts* ***per calendar****. You can easily configure default alerts in a Birthdays calendar to remind you one week before, one day before, and on the day. At the same time, you can default to less aggressive notifications in your other calendars.*

### Add multiple alerts to events

Now that you set up your default notification preferences, all future events will use the notification settings you've applied. Morgen also allows you to add multiple alerts to any event.

In your calendar, open any event, then click its alert setting. In this example, a notification will alert you 30 minutes before the event starts.

*For important events or scheduled tasks, you can add additional notifications. These will only appear on desktop.*

‚Äç

Click the + icon next to Add an Alert to add more. By default, Morgen adds another alert 1 hour before the event. Click + again, and Morgen adds another alert 2 hours before the event; each new alert is twice the time of the previous one.

You can change these alerts, as you saw above, choosing minutes, hours, days, or weeks, and changing the value. It can be useful, for example, to set one alert one day before an important meeting, another a couple of hours before, then another 15 minutes before it starts. For all-day events, you may want to get a notification a few days before, especially if you need to prepare for the event.

You can add as many alerts as you want to any event, and you can easily delete any alert by clicking the red trash icon next to it.

When you've finished, click Save.

That's it. Take control of your calendar with multiple alerts, to ensure not only that you don't miss events, but so you have time to prepare for them.

### Notifications across your devices

Your default and custom notifications will be delivered across your devices. The one exception is any extra event-specific notifications will not be delivered on mobile.

If you don't see Morgen notifications:

- Ensure that your mobile and desktop settings have alerts from Morgen turned on.
- Check if you are in DND or Focus Mode, which will likely prevent Morgen notifications from appearing.
