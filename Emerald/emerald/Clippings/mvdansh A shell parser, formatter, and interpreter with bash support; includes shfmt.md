## sh

A shell parser, formatter, and interpreter. Supports [POSIX Shell](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), and [mksh](http://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm). Requires Go 1.23 or later.

### Quick start

To parse shell scripts, inspect them, and print them out, see the [syntax examples](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax#pkg-examples).

For high-level operations like performing shell expansions on strings, see the [shell examples](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/sh/v3/shell#pkg-examples).

### shfmt

```
go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest
```

`shfmt` formats shell programs. See [canonical.sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/syntax/canonical.sh) for a quick look at its default style. For example:

```
shfmt -l -w script.sh
```

For more information, see [its manpage](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd), which can be viewed directly as Markdown or rendered with [scdoc](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/).

Packages are available on [Alpine](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=shfmt), [Arch](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/shfmt/), [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/golang-mvdan-sh), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvdan/shfmt/), [Fedora](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/golang-mvdan-sh-3/shfmt/), [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/devel/shfmt),[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/shfmt), [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/shfmt/details/), [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/HEAD/pkgs/tools/text/shfmt/default.nix), [OpenSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/shfmt), [Scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/HEAD/bucket/shfmt.json), [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/shfmt), [Void](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/HEAD/srcpkgs/shfmt/template) and [webi](https://webinstall.dev/shfmt/).

### gosh

```
go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/gosh@latest
```

Proof of concept shell that uses `interp`. Note that it's not meant to replace a POSIX shell at the moment, and its options are intentionally minimalistic.

### Fuzzing

We use Go's native fuzzing support. For instance:

```
cd syntax
go test -run=- -fuzz=ParsePrint
```

### Caveats

- When indexing Bash associative arrays, always use quotes. The static parser will otherwise have to assume that the index is an arithmetic expression.
```
$ echo '${array[spaced string]}' | shfmt
1:16: not a valid arithmetic operator: string
$ echo '${array[dash-string]}' | shfmt
${array[dash - string]}
```
- `$((` and `((` ambiguity is not supported. Backtracking would complicate the parser and make streaming support via `io.Reader` impossible. The POSIX spec recommends to [space the operands](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_03) if `$( (` is meant.
```
$ echo '$((foo); (bar))' | shfmt
1:1: reached ) without matching $(( with ))
```
- `export`, `let`, and `declare` are parsed as keywords. This allows statically building their syntax tree, as opposed to keeping the arguments as a slice of words. It is also required to support `declare foo=(bar)`. Note that this means expansions like `declare {a,b}=c` are not supported.

### JavaScript

A subset of the Go packages are available as an npm package called [mvdan-sh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mvdan-sh). See the [\_js](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/_js) directory for more information.

### Docker

All release tags are published via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvdan/shfmt/), such as `v3.5.1`. The latest stable release is currently published as `v3`, and the latest development version as `latest`. The images only include `shfmt`; `-alpine` variants exist on Alpine Linux.

To build a Docker image, run:

```
docker build -t my:tag -f cmd/shfmt/Dockerfile .
```

To use a Docker image, run:

```
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/mnt" -w /mnt my:tag <shfmt arguments>
```
