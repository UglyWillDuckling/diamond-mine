Type aliasing is a feature in some programming languages that allows creating a [[reference]] to a type **using another name**. 
It does not create a new type hence does not increase type safety. It can be used to shorten a long name. 

Languages allowing type aliasing include: C++, C# Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Elm, F#, Go, Hack, Haskell, Julia, Kotlin, Nim, OCaml, Python, Rust, Scala, Swift and [[TypeScript]].
