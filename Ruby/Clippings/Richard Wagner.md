**Wilhelm Richard Wagner** ( [*VAHG\-nər*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key");[^1][^2] German: [\[ˈʁɪçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German") <sup class="ext-phonos-attribution noexcerpt navigation-not-searchable"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:De-Richard_Wagner.ogg" title="File:De-Richard Wagner.ogg">ⓘ</a></sup>; 22 May 1813 – 13 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, essayist, and conductor who is chiefly known for his [operas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operas "Operas") (or, as some of his mature works were later known, "[music dramas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_drama "Music drama")"). Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the [libretto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto "Libretto") and the music for each of his stage works. Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of [Carl Maria von Weber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Maria_von_Weber "Carl Maria von Weber") and [Giacomo Meyerbeer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Meyerbeer "Giacomo Meyerbeer"), Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the *[Gesamtkunstwerk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk "Gesamtkunstwerk")* ("total work of art"), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama. The drama was to be presented as a continuously sung narrative, without conventional operatic structures like [arias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria "Aria") and [recitatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recitative "Recitative"). He described this vision in a [series of essays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prose_works_by_Richard_Wagner "List of prose works by Richard Wagner") published between 1849 and 1852. Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the 16-hour, four-opera cycle *[Der Ring des Nibelungen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen "Der Ring des Nibelungen")* (*The Ring of the [Nibelung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelung "Nibelung"),* also known simply as *The Ring*).

Wagner's compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex [textures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_\(music\) "Texture (music)"), rich [harmonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony "Harmony") and [orchestration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration "Orchestration"), and the elaborate use of [leitmotifs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif "Leitmotif")—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme [chromaticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaticism "Chromaticism") and quickly shifting [tonal centres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality "Tonality"), greatly influenced the development of classical music; his *[Tristan und Isolde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde "Tristan und Isolde")* is regarded as an important precursor towards [modern music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism_\(music\) "Modernism (music)"). As he matured, he softened his ideological stance against traditional operatic forms (ie. arias, ensembles and [choruses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir "Choir")), reintroducing them into his last few stage works, including *[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg")* (*The Mastersingers of Nuremberg*) and *[Parsifal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal "Parsifal")*.

To properly present his vision of the works, Wagner had his own [opera house](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_house "Opera house") built to his specifications: the [Bayreuth Festspielhaus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth_Festspielhaus "Bayreuth Festspielhaus"), which featured many innovative design elements intended to immerse the audience in the drama. The premieres of *The Ring* and *Parsifal* took place there, and his [most important stage works](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth_canon "Bayreuth canon") are performed at the annual [Bayreuth Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth_Festival "Bayreuth Festival"). The early success of the festival was secured by the efforts of his wife, [Cosima Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosima_Wagner "Cosima Wagner"), and has since been maintained by [their descendants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_family "Wagner family"), attracting audiences from around the world.

Wagner's unorthodox operas, essays, and personal dealings engendered considerable controversy during his lifetime, and continue to do so. Declared a "genius" by some and a "disease" by others, his music is widely performed, but his views on religion, politics, and social life are debated—most notably on the extent to which his [antisemitism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism") finds expression in his stage and prose works. The effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.
