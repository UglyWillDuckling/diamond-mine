## Early life

Berry was born Maria Halle Berry in [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland "Cleveland"), Ohio,[^1] on August 14, 1966,[^2] to Judith Ann (née Hawkins), a first generation American whose mother, Nelle Hawkins, (née Dicken), came from [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool "Liverpool"),[^3] and Jerome Jesse Berry, an African-American man.[^1] Her name was legally changed to Halle Maria Berry at the age of five.[^4] Her parents selected her middle name from [Halle's Department Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Brothers_Co. "Halle Brothers Co."), which was then a local landmark in Cleveland.[^1] Berry's mother worked as a psychiatric nurse, and her father worked in the same hospital as an attendant in the psychiatric ward; he later became a bus driver.[^1] They divorced when Berry was four years old, and she and her older sister Heidi Berry-Henderson [^5] were raised exclusively by their mother.[^1] She has been estranged from her father since childhood,[^1] [^6] noting in 1992 that she did not even know if he was still alive.[^5] Her father was abusive to her mother, and Berry has recalled witnessing her mother being beaten daily, kicked down stairs, and hit in the head with a wine bottle.[^7] Berry has also said that she was bullied as a child and, as a result, learned how to fight and protect herself.[^8]

Berry grew up in [Oakwood, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakwood,_Cuyahoga_County,_Ohio "Oakwood, Cuyahoga County, Ohio"),[^9] and graduated from [Bedford High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_High_School_\(Bedford,_Ohio\) "Bedford High School (Bedford, Ohio)"), where she was a cheerleader, honor student, editor of the school newspaper, and [prom queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prom "Prom").[^10] She worked in the children's department of [Higbee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higbee%27s "Higbee's") department store. She then continued her studies at [Cuyahoga Community College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_Community_College "Cuyahoga Community College"). In the 1980s, she entered several beauty contests, winning Miss Teen All American 1985 and [Miss Ohio USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Ohio_USA "Miss Ohio USA") 1986.[^11] She was the 1986 [Miss USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_USA "Miss USA") first runner-up, with [Christy Fichtner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Fichtner "Christy Fichtner") of Texas taking home the crown.[^11] In the Miss USA 1986 pageant interview competition, Berry said she hoped to become an entertainer or do some kind of work in media. Her interview was awarded the highest score by the judges.[^12] In 1986, Berry became the first African-American to represent the United States at the [Miss World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_World_1986 "Miss World 1986") beauty pageant. She placed sixth, with [Trinidad and Tobago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago "Trinidad and Tobago") 's [Giselle Laronde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giselle_Laronde "Giselle Laronde") being crowned Miss World.[^13]

## Career

In 1989, Berry moved to New York City to pursue her acting ambitions.[^14] During her early time there, she ran out of money and briefly lived in a homeless shelter and a [YMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA "YMCA").[^15] [^16] [^17] Her situation improved by the end of that year, and she was cast in the role of model Emily Franklin in the short-lived ABC television series *[Living Dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Dolls "Living Dolls")*, which was shot in New York and was a spin-off of the hit series *[Who's the Boss?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_the_Boss%3F "Who's the Boss?")*.[^15] During the taping of *Living Dolls*, she lapsed into a coma and was diagnosed with [type 1 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes "Type 1 diabetes").[^18] [^19] [^20] After the cancellation of *Living Dolls*, she moved to Los Angeles.[^15]

Berry's film debut was in a small role for [Spike Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee "Spike Lee") 's *[Jungle Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Fever "Jungle Fever")* (1991), in which she played Vivian, a drug addict.[^1] That same year, Berry had her first co-starring role in *[Strictly Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Business_\(1991_film\) "Strictly Business (1991 film)")*. In 1992, Berry portrayed a career woman who falls for the lead character played by [Eddie Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy "Eddie Murphy") in the romantic comedy *[Boomerang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_\(1992_film\) "Boomerang (1992 film)")*.

Berry tackled a more serious role, playing a former drug addict struggling to regain custody of her son in *[Losing Isaiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_Isaiah "Losing Isaiah")* (1995), starring opposite [Jessica Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Lange "Jessica Lange"). She portrayed Sandra Beecher in *[Race the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_the_Sun_\(film\) "Race the Sun (film)")* (1996), which was based on a true story, shot in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), and co-starred alongside Kurt Russell in *[Executive Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Decision "Executive Decision")*. Beginning in 1996, she was a [Revlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revlon "Revlon") spokeswoman for seven years and renewed her contract in 2004.[^22] [^23]

She starred alongside Natalie Deselle Reid in the 1997 comedy film *[B\*A\*P\*S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.P.S. "B.A.P.S.")*. In 1998, Berry received praise for her role in *[Bulworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulworth "Bulworth")* as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician ([Warren Beatty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty "Warren Beatty")) a new lease on life. The same year, she played the singer [Zola Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zola_Taylor "Zola Taylor"), one of the three wives of pop singer [Frankie Lymon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Lymon "Frankie Lymon"), in the biopic *[Why Do Fools Fall in Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Do_Fools_Fall_in_Love_\(film\) "Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)")*.

In the 1999 [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") biopic *[Introducing Dorothy Dandridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introducing_Dorothy_Dandridge "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge")*,[^24] she portrayed [Dorothy Dandridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Dandridge "Dorothy Dandridge"), the first African American woman to be nominated for the [Academy Award for Best Actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress "Academy Award for Best Actress"). It was to Berry a heartfelt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for it to come through.[^1] Berry won awards including a [Primetime Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award "Primetime Emmy Award") and [Golden Globe Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award").[^11] [^25]

Berry portrayed the mutant superhero [Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_\(Marvel_Comics\) "Storm (Marvel Comics)") in the film adaptation of the comic book series *[X-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_\(film\) "X-Men (film)")* (2000) and its sequels, *[X2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X2_\(film\) "X2 (film)")* (2003), *[X-Men: The Last Stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Last_Stand "X-Men: The Last Stand")* (2006) and *[X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Days_of_Future_Past "X-Men: Days of Future Past")* (2014). In 2001, Berry appeared in the film *[Swordfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordfish_\(film\) "Swordfish (film)")*, which featured her first [topless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toplessness "Toplessness") scene.[^26] At first, she was opposed to a sunbathing scene in the film in which she would appear topless, but Berry eventually agreed. Some people attributed her change of heart to a substantial increase in the amount Warner Bros. offered her;[^27] she was reportedly paid an additional $500,000 for the short scene.[^28] Berry denied these stories, telling one interviewer that they amused her and "made for great publicity for the movie." [^26] [^29] After turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she said she decided to make *Swordfish* because her then-husband, Eric Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks.[^30]

Berry appeared as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer ([Sean Combs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs "Sean Combs")), in the 2001 feature film *[Monster's Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster%27s_Ball "Monster's Ball")*. Her performance was awarded the [National Board of Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review "National Board of Review") and the [Screen Actors Guild Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award "Screen Actors Guild Award") for Best Actress. She became the only African-American woman to win the [Academy Award for Best Actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress "Academy Award for Best Actress").[^31] The [NAACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP "NAACP") issued the statement: "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [^32] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star [Billy Bob Thornton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bob_Thornton "Billy Bob Thornton") was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part.[^30] Berry responded: "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, and it would be a really special script that would require something like that again." [^30]

Berry asked for a higher fee for Revlon advertisements after winning the Oscar. [Ron Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Perelman "Ron Perelman"), the cosmetics firm's chief, congratulated her, saying how happy he was that she modeled for his company. She replied, "Of course, you'll have to pay me more." Perelman stalked off in a rage.[^33] In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity. She said, "This moment is so much bigger than me. This is for every nameless, faceless woman of color who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened." [^34]

[^30] [^37] According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time.[^38] Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation.[^39] After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for *X2*.[^40]

Production was halted for eight weeks.[^41] It was a moderate hit at the United States box office, taking in $60 million; it earned another $80 million abroad.[^42] Berry appeared in the [nu metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal "Nu metal") band [Limp Bizkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp_Bizkit "Limp Bizkit") 's music video for " [Behind Blue Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_Blue_Eyes "Behind Blue Eyes") " for the motion picture soundtrack for the film.

Berry starred as the title role in the film *[Catwoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman_\(film\) "Catwoman (film)")*,[^42] for which she received US$12.5 million.[^44] It is widely regarded by critics as [one of the worst films ever made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worst_films "List of worst films").[^45] She was awarded the Worst Actress [Razzie Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Awards "Golden Raspberry Awards") for her performance; she appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (while holding her Oscar from *Monster's Ball*) [^46] with a sense of humor, considering it an experience of the "rock bottom" in order to be "at the top." [^47] Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, "I never in my life thought that I would be up here, winning a Razzie! It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [^48]

She received her second [Primetime Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award "Primetime Emmy Award") nomination for her role. Also in 2005, she served as an executive producer in *[Lackawanna Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lackawanna_Blues_\(film\) "Lackawanna Blues (film)")*, and landed her voice for the character of [Cappy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Robots_characters "List of Robots characters"), one of the many mechanical beings in the animated feature *[Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_\(2005_film\) "Robots (2005 film)")*.[^49]

The film grossed a modest US$73 million worldwide, and received lukewarm reviews from critics, who felt that despite the presence of Berry and Willis, it is "too convoluted to work, and features a twist ending that's irritating and superfluous." [^50] Her next 2007 film release was the drama *[Things We Lost in the Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_We_Lost_in_the_Fire_\(film\) "Things We Lost in the Fire (film)")*, co-starring [Benicio del Toro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benicio_del_Toro "Benicio del Toro"), where she took on the role of a recent widow befriending the troubled friend of her late husband. The film was the first time in which she worked with a female director, Danish [Susanne Bier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Bier "Susanne Bier"), giving her a new feeling of "thinking the same way," which she appreciated.[^51] While the film made US$8.6 million in its global theatrical run,[^52] it garnered positive reviews from writers; *[The Austin Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Austin_Chronicle "The Austin Chronicle")* found the film to be "an impeccably constructed and perfectly paced drama of domestic and internal volatility" and felt that "Berry is brilliant here, as good as she's ever been."

The film received a limited theatrical release, to a mixed critical response. *[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter "The Hollywood Reporter")* nevertheless described the film as "a well-wrought psychological drama that delves into the dark side of one woman's psyche" and found Berry to be "spellbinding" in it.[^56] She earned the [African-American Film Critics Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Film_Critics_Association "African-American Film Critics Association") Award for Best Actress and a [Golden Globe Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award") nomination for [Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Drama "Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama").[^57] [^58] She next made part of a large ensemble cast in [Garry Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Marshall "Garry Marshall") 's romantic comedy *[New Year's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve_\(2011_film\) "New Year's Eve (2011 film)")* (2011), with [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer "Michelle Pfeiffer"), [Jessica Biel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Biel "Jessica Biel"), [Robert De Niro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro"), [Josh Duhamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Duhamel "Josh Duhamel"), [Zac Efron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Efron "Zac Efron"), [Sarah Jessica Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jessica_Parker "Sarah Jessica Parker"), and [Sofía Vergara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sof%C3%ADa_Vergara "Sofía Vergara"), among many others.

Berry was drawn to "the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [^66] [Manohla Dargis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohla_Dargis "Manohla Dargis") of *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* found the film to be "an effectively creepy thriller," [^67] while reviewer Dwight Brown felt that "the script gives Berry a blue-collar character she can make accessible, vulnerable and gutsy\[...\]." [^68] *The Call* was a [sleeper hit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_hit "Sleeper hit"), grossing US$68.6 million around the globe.[^69]

In 2014, Berry signed on to star and serve as a co-executive producer in [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Broadcasting_System "Columbia Broadcasting System") drama series *[Extant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_\(TV_series\) "Extant (TV series)")*,[^70] where she took on the role of [Molly Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Woods "Molly Woods"), an astronaut who struggles to reconnect with her husband and android son after spending 13 months in space. The show ran for two seasons until 2015, receiving largely positive reviews from critics.[^71] [^72] [^73] *[USA Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today "USA Today")* remarked: "She \[Halle Berry\] brings a dignity and gravity to Molly, a projected intelligence that allows you to buy her as an astronaut and to see what has happened to her as frightening rather than ridiculous. Berry's all in, and you float along." [^74] Also in 2014, Berry launched a new production company, [606 Films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/606_Films "606 Films"), with producing partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas. It is named after the Anti-Paparazzi Bill, SB 606, that the actress pushed for and which was signed into law by California Governor [Jerry Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown "Jerry Brown") in the fall of 2013. The new company emerged as part of a deal for Berry to work in *Extant*.[^75]

Berry at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con

In the stand-up comedy [concert film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film "Concert film") *[Kevin Hart: What Now?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart:_What_Now%3F "Kevin Hart: What Now?")* (2016), Berry appeared as herself, opposite [Kevin Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart "Kevin Hart"), attending a poker game event that goes horribly wrong.[^76] She provided uncredited vocals to the song "Calling All My Lovelies" by [Bruno Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Mars "Bruno Mars") from his third studio album, *[24K Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24K_Magic_\(album\) "24K Magic (album)")* (2016).[^77] *[Kidnap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnap_\(2017_film\) "Kidnap (2017 film)")*, an abduction thriller Berry filmed in 2014, was released in 2017.[^78] In the film, she starred as a diner waitress tailing a vehicle when her son is kidnapped by its occupants. *Kidnap* grossed US$34 million and garnered mixed reviews from writers, who felt that it "strays into poorly scripted exploitation too often to take advantage of its pulpy premise — or the still-impressive talents of \[Berry\]." [^79] She next played an agent employed by a secret American spy organisation in the action comedy sequel *[Kingsman: The Golden Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsman:_The_Golden_Circle "Kingsman: The Golden Circle")* (2017), as part of an ensemble cast, consisting of [Colin Firth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Firth "Colin Firth"), [Taron Egerton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taron_Egerton "Taron Egerton"), [Mark Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Strong "Mark Strong"), [Julianne Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julianne_Moore "Julianne Moore"), and [Elton John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John "Elton John"). While critical response towards the film was mixed, it made US$414 million worldwide.[^80]

Alongside [Daniel Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig "Daniel Craig"), Berry starred as a working-class mother during the [1992 Los Angeles riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots "1992 Los Angeles riots") in [Deniz Gamze Ergüven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniz_Gamze_Erg%C3%BCven "Deniz Gamze Ergüven") 's drama *[Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_\(2017_film\) "Kings (2017 film)")* (2017). The film found a limited theatrical release following its initial screening at the [Toronto International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival "Toronto International Film Festival"),[^81] and as part of an overall lukewarm reception,[^82] *Variety* noted: "It should be said that Berry has given some of the best and worst performances of the past quarter-century, but this is perhaps the only one that swings to both extremes in the same movie." [^83] Berry competed against [James Corden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Corden "James Corden") in the first rap battle on the first episode of  [TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBS_\(U.S._TV_channel\) "TBS (U.S. TV channel)") 's *[Drop the Mic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_the_Mic "Drop the Mic")*, originally aired on October 24, 2017.[^84]

She played Sofia, an assassin, in the film *[John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick:_Chapter_3_%E2%80%93_Parabellum "John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum")*, which was released on May 17, 2019, by [Lionsgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Studios "Lionsgate Studios").[^85] She is, as of February 2019, executive producer of the [BET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET "BET") television series *[Boomerang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_\(U.S._TV_series\) "Boomerang (U.S. TV series)")*, based on the film in which she starred. The series premiered February 12, 2019.[^86]

Berry made her directorial debut with the feature *[Bruised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruised_\(film\) "Bruised (film)")* in which she plays a disgraced MMA fighter named Jackie Justice, who reconnects with her estranged son. The film premiered at the [Toronto International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival "Toronto International Film Festival") in September 2020 [^87] and was released on [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") in November 2021.[^88] Berry received a positive review from *[Deadline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood "Deadline Hollywood")* for her performance.[^89]

In January 2023, Berry signed with Range Media Partners as a producer and director.[^90]

In April 2025, Berry was announced as a member of the jury for Main Competition section of the [2025 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Cannes_Film_Festival "2025 Cannes Film Festival").[^91]

Berry in 2025

Berry was ranked No. 1 on *[People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_\(American_magazine\) "People (American magazine)")* 's "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" list in 2003 after making the top ten seven times and appeared No. 1 on *FHM* 's "100 Sexiest Women in the World" the same year.[^92] [^93] She was named *[Esquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_\(magazine\) "Esquire (magazine)")* magazine's "Sexiest Woman Alive" in October 2008, about which she stated: "I don't know exactly what it means, but being 42 and having just had a baby, I think I'll take it." [^94] [^95] *[Men's Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_Health_\(magazine\) "Men's Health (magazine)")* ranked her at No. 35 on their "100 Hottest Women of All-Time" list.[^96] In 2009, she was voted #23 on [*Empire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(film_magazine\) "Empire (film magazine)") 's 100 Sexiest Film Stars.[^97] The same year, rapper [Hurricane Chris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Chris_\(rapper\) "Hurricane Chris (rapper)") released a song titled " [Halle Berry (She's Fine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry_\(She%27s_Fine\) "Halle Berry (She's Fine)") " extolling Berry's beauty and sex appeal.[^98] At the age of 42 (in 2008), she was named the "Sexiest Black Woman" by Access Hollywood's "TV One Access" survey.[^99] [^100] [^101] [^102] Born to an African-American father and a white mother, Berry has stated that her biracial background was "painful and confusing" when she was a young woman, and she made the decision early on to identify as a black woman because she knew that was how she would be perceived.[^14]

## Personal life

Berry dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from March 1989 to October 1991.[^103] In November 1993, Ronan sued Berry for $80,000 in what he claimed were unpaid loans to help launch her career.[^104] Berry contended that the money was a gift, and a judge dismissed the case because Ronan did not list Berry as a debtor when he filed for [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy "Bankruptcy") in 1992.[^10]

According to Berry, a beating from a former abusive boyfriend during the filming of *[The Last Boy Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Boy_Scout "The Last Boy Scout")* in 1991 punctured her eardrum and caused her to lose 80% of her hearing in her left ear.[^10] She has never named the abuser, but she said that he was someone "well known in Hollywood". In 2004, her former boyfriend [Christopher Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Williams_\(singer\) "Christopher Williams (singer)") accused [Wesley Snipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Snipes "Wesley Snipes") of being responsible for the incident, saying, "I'm so tired of people thinking I'm the guy \[who did it\]. Wesley Snipes busted her eardrum, not me." [^105]

Berry first saw baseball player [David Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Justice "David Justice") on TV playing in an [MTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV "MTV") celebrity baseball game in February 1992. When a reporter from Justice's hometown of [Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati "Cincinnati") told her that Justice was a fan, Berry gave her phone number to the reporter to give to Justice.[^10] Berry married Justice shortly after midnight on January 1, 1993.[^106] Following their separation in February 1996, Berry stated publicly that she was so depressed that she had considered taking her own life.[^107] [^108] Berry and Justice were divorced on June 20, 1997.[^109]

In May 2000, Berry pleaded no contest to a charge of leaving the scene of a car accident; she was sentenced to three years' probation, fined $13,500, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.[^110]

Berry married her second husband, singer-songwriter [Eric Benét](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ben%C3%A9t "Eric Benét"), on January 24, 2001, following a two-year courtship.[^30] [^111] Benét underwent treatment for sex addiction in 2002.[^112] By early October 2003, they had separated,[^111] and their divorce was finalized on January 3, 2005.[^113] [^114]

In November 2005, Berry began dating French-Canadian model [Gabriel Aubry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Aubry "Gabriel Aubry"), whom she had met at a [Versace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Versace_S.p.A. "Gianni Versace S.p.A.") photoshoot.[^115] Berry gave birth to their daughter in March 2008.[^116] On April 30, 2010, Berry and Aubry announced that their relationship had ended some months earlier.[^117] In January 2011, Berry and Aubry became involved in a highly publicized custody battle,[^118] [^119] [^120] centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor [Olivier Martinez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Martinez "Olivier Martinez"), whom Berry had started dating in 2010, having met him while filming *[Dark Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Tide "Dark Tide")* in South Africa.[^121] Aubry objected to the move on the ground that it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement.[^122] In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France.[^123] Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a [citizen's arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_arrest "Citizen's arrest") on Aubry and, because it was considered a [domestic violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence "Domestic violence") incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, and the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012.[^124] In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight had begun when Martinez had threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France.[^125] Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.[^126] On November 29, 2012, Berry's lawyer announced that Berry and Aubry had reached an amicable custody agreement in court.[^127] In June 2014, a [Superior Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_Court "Superior Court") ruling called for Berry to pay Aubry $16,000 a month in child support as well as a retroactive payment of $115,000 and $300,000 for Aubry's attorney fees.[^128]

Berry and Martinez confirmed their engagement in March 2012,[^129] [^130] and married in France on July 13, 2013.[^131] In October 2013, Berry gave birth to their son.[^132] In 2015, after two years of marriage, the couple announced they were divorcing.[^133] The divorce was finalized in December 2016.[^134] In August 2023, issues dealing with custody and child support were settled.[^135]

Berry started dating American musician [Van Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Hunt "Van Hunt") in 2020, which was revealed through her Instagram.[^136] [^137]

[^139] In May 2007, Governor [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger "Arnold Schwarzenegger") vetoed the facility.[^140] [Hasty Pudding Theatricals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasty_Pudding_Theatricals "Hasty Pudding Theatricals") gave her its 2006 *Woman of The Year* award.[^141] Berry took part in a nearly 2,000-house cellphone-bank campaign for [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") in February 2008.[^142] In April 2013, she appeared in a video clip for [Gucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci "Gucci") 's "Chime for Change" campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in terms of education, health, and justice.[^143] In August 2013, Berry testified alongside [Jennifer Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner "Jennifer Garner") before the California State Assembly's Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[^144] The bill passed in September.[^145]

In May 2024, Berry advocated for more research and education on [menopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause "Menopause") by supporting a bill introduced by [Senators Patty Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray "Patty Murray") and [Lisa Murkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski "Lisa Murkowski"). Berry said, "I'm in menopause, OK?... The shame has to be taken out of menopause. We have to talk about this very normal part of our life that happens. Our doctors can't even say the word to us, let alone walk us through the journey." [^146]
