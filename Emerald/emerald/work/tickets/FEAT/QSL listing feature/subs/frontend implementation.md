## description
Implement the qsl listing frontend display. The listings should be displayed in the [[project]]'s header **only**.
 At least for now.
The listings need to be grouped by the [[realtor]] as are the existing listings.

### <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirements</mark>
- only ==active== listings should be shown
- all [[QSL listing]]'s should have a button indicating their [[online status]]
## <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accept</mark>

- qsl listings are displayed
	- [[online status]]
	- `linked`
## note
`share/ui.project.inc`#ln-682
method: `project_contract_header`
- the new listings will need to be rendered differently
[[where the confirmed listings are printed]]
