A playthrough of Nintendo's 1992 platformer for the Nintendo Game Boy, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins.  
  
This playthrough shows all 32 stages, including the secret ones.  
  
The second of Gunpei Yokoi's Mario games on the Game Boy is just as good as the classic original title that helped launch the iconic white brick. There are several differences between the two games though. Whereas the original Super Mario Land's mechanics made it feel similar in many ways to the original NES Super Mario Bros., this one borrows most of its gameplay conventions from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  
  
Mario now has an overworld map that he travels to move between levels, and Mario can pick up a carrot power-up that gives him bunny ears for gliding, similar to the way the raccoon and the cape items worked on the console games.  
  
The graphics also appear somewhat more similar to the console games' ones at first glance, but it doesn't take long to notice some things that make it clear that Yokoi was heading this effort, not Miyamoto. All 32 levels are all pretty creatively built and feature some cool oddities, like a spirit infested graveyard and the innards of a giant Mario robot, and they all feature a number of obstacles and enemies entirely unique to this entire in the long-running Mario series. The sound is quite different as well from any other game - though a few of the tracks have been remixed and used since SML2's release, many of them appear only in this title. The invincibility music is a particular stand out, not resembling the classic SMB version really in any way.  
  
I love this game, and it was deservedly a huge hit when it was released. My only qualm with it is that it is entirely too easy. Mario Land itself wasn't particularly difficult, but with tons of power-ups and extra lives always available, Mario Land 2 is about as easy of a platformer as you're going to find on the Game Boy. I still would like to know why anyone felt that a 99-up bonus was really necessary here. It's a small gripe for an otherwise fantastic game.  
  
The last boss fight also marks the first appearance of Wario in any game, and he looks awesome in a crazed, maniacal sort of way. Apparently everyone liked this addition, since Super Mario Land 3 stars Wario as the playable character.
