***Der Ring des Nibelungen*** (***The Ring of the Nibelung***), [WWV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis "Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis") 86, is a [cycle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_cycle "Literary cycle") of four [German-language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-language "German-language") [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry "Epic poetry") [music dramas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikdrama "Musikdrama") composed by [Richard Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner "Richard Wagner"). The works are based loosely on characters from [Germanic heroic legend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_heroic_legend "Germanic heroic legend"), namely Norse [legendary sagas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_saga "Legendary saga") and the *[Nibelungenlied](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied "Nibelungenlied")*. The composer termed the cycle a "*Bühnenfestspiel*" (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a *[Vorabend](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vorabend "wikt:Vorabend")* ("preliminary evening"). It is often referred to as the ***Ring* cycle**, **Wagner's *Ring***, or simply ***The Ring***.

Wagner wrote the [libretto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto "Libretto") and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four parts that constitute the *Ring* cycle are, in sequence:

- *[Das Rheingold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Rheingold "Das Rheingold")* (*The Rhinegold*)
- *[Die Walküre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Walk%C3%BCre "Die Walküre")* (*The Valkyrie*)
- *[Siegfried](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_\(opera\) "Siegfried (opera)")*
- *[Götterdämmerung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung "Götterdämmerung")* (*Twilight of the Gods*)

Individual works of the sequence are often performed separately,[^1] and indeed the operas contain dialogues that mention events in the previous operas, so that a viewer could watch any of them without having watched the previous parts and still understand the plot. However, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first [Bayreuth Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth_Festival "Bayreuth Festival") in 1876, beginning with *Das Rheingold* on 13 August and ending with *Götterdämmerung* on 17 August. Opera stage director Anthony Freud stated that *Der Ring des Nibelungen* "marks the high-water mark of our art form, the most massive challenge any opera company can undertake."[^2]

Wagner's title is most literally rendered in English as *The Ring of the Nibelung*. The [Nibelung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelung "Nibelung") of the title is the [dwarf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_\(mythology\) "Dwarf (mythology)") [[Alberich]], and the ring in question is the one he fashions from the [[Rhinegold]]. The title therefore denotes "Alberich's Ring".[^footnotemagee2001109-3]

The cycle is a work of extraordinary scale.[^4] A full performance of the cycle takes place over four nights at the opera, with a total playing time of about 15 hours, depending on the conductor's pacing. The first and shortest work, *Das Rheingold*, has no interval and is one continuous piece of music typically lasting around two and a half hours, while the final and longest, *Götterdämmerung*, takes up to five hours, excluding intervals. The cycle is modelled after ancient [Greek dramas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece "Theatre of ancient Greece") that were presented as three tragedies and one [satyr play](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr_play "Satyr play"). The *Ring* proper begins with *Die Walküre* and ends with *Götterdämmerung*, with *Rheingold* as a [prelude](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_\(music\) "Prelude (music)"). Wagner called *Das Rheingold* a *Vorabend* or "Preliminary Evening", and *Die Walküre*, *Siegfried* and *Götterdämmerung* were subtitled First Day, Second Day and Third Day, respectively, of the trilogy proper.

The scale and scope of the story is epic. It follows the struggles of [gods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir "Æsir"), [heroes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero "Hero"), and several mythical creatures over the eponymous magic ring that grants domination over the entire world. The drama and intrigue continue through three generations of protagonists, until the final cataclysm at the end of *Götterdämmerung*.

The music of the cycle is thick and richly textured, and grows in complexity as the cycle proceeds. Wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions, including a greatly enlarged brass section with new instruments such as the [Wagner tuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_tuba "Wagner tuba"), [bass trumpet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_trumpet "Bass trumpet") and [contrabass trombone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabass_trombone "Contrabass trombone"). Remarkably, he uses a chorus only relatively briefly, in acts 2 and 3 of *Götterdämmerung*, and then mostly of men with just a few women. He eventually had a purpose-built theatre constructed, the [Bayreuth Festspielhaus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth_Festspielhaus "Bayreuth Festspielhaus"), in which to perform this work. The theatre has a special stage that blends the huge orchestra with the singers' voices, allowing them to sing at a natural volume. The result was that the singers did not have to strain themselves vocally during the long performances.

The plot revolves around a magic ring that grants the power to rule the world, forged by the [Nibelung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelung "Nibelung") [dwarf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_\(mythology\) "Dwarf (mythology)") Alberich from gold he stole from the [Rhine maidens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine_maidens "Rhine maidens") in the river [Rhine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine "Rhine"). With the assistance of the god [[Loge]], [[Wotan]] – the chief of the [gods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_gods "Norse gods") – steals the ring from Alberich, but is forced to hand it over to the [giants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant "Giant") [[Fafner]] and Fasolt in payment for building the home of the gods, [Valhalla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla "Valhalla"), or they will take [[Freia]], who provides the gods with the golden apples that keep them young. 
Wotan's schemes to regain the ring, spanning generations, drive much of the action in the story. His grandson, the [mortal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") [[Siegfried]], wins the ring by slaying Fafner (who slew Fasolt for the ring) – as Wotan intended – but is eventually betrayed and slain as a result of the intrigues of Alberich's son Hagen, who wants the ring for himself. Finally, the Valkyrie [[Brünnhilde]] – Siegfried's lover and Wotan's daughter who lost her immortality for defying her father in an attempt to save Siegfried's[[ father Sigmund]] – returns the ring to the [[Rhine maidens]] as she commits suicide on Siegfried's funeral pyre.
Hagen is drowned as he attempts to recover the ring. In the process, the gods and [[Valhalla]] are destroyed.

Wagner created the story of the *Ring* by fusing elements from many German and Scandinavian myths and folk-tales. The [Old Norse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology "Norse mythology") *[Edda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda "Edda")* supplied much of the material for *Das Rheingold*, while *Die Walküre* was largely based on the *[Völsunga saga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga "Völsunga saga")*. *Siegfried* contains elements from the Eddur, the *Völsunga saga* and *[Thidrekssaga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thidrekssaga "Thidrekssaga")*. 
The final *Götterdämmerung* draws from the 12th-century German poem, the *[Nibelungenlied](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied "Nibelungenlied")*, which appears to have been the original inspiration for the *Ring*.

*The Ring* has been the subject of myriad interpretations. For example, [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "George Bernard Shaw"), in *[The Perfect Wagnerite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perfect_Wagnerite "The Perfect Wagnerite")*, argues for a view of *The Ring* as an essentially socialist critique of [industrial society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_society "Industrial society") and its abuses. [Robert Donington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Donington "Robert Donington") in *Wagner's Ring And Its Symbols* interprets it in terms of [Jungian psychology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_psychology "Jungian psychology"), as an account of the development of [unconscious](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind "Unconscious mind") [archetypes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype "Archetype") in the mind, leading towards [individuation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation "Individuation").

In his earlier operas (up to and including *[Lohengrin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lohengrin_\(opera\) "Lohengrin (opera)")*) Wagner's style had been based, rather than on the Italian style of opera, on the German style as developed by [Carl Maria von Weber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Maria_von_Weber "Carl Maria von Weber"), with elements of the [grand opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_opera "Grand opera") style of [Giacomo Meyerbeer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Meyerbeer "Giacomo Meyerbeer"). However he came to be dissatisfied with such a format as a means of artistic expression. He expressed this clearly in his essay "[A Communication to My Friends](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Communication_to_My_Friends "A Communication to My Friends")" (1851), in which he condemned the majority of modern artists, in painting and in music, as "**feminine** ... the world of art close fenced from Life, in which Art plays with herself.' Where however the impressions of Life produce an overwhelming 'poetic force', we find the '**masculine**, the generative path of Art'.[^footnotewagner1994287-11]

Wagner unfortunately found that his audiences were not willing to follow where he led them:

> The public, by their enthusiastic reception of *[Rienzi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rienzi "Rienzi")* and their cooler welcome of the *[Flying Dutchman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_fliegende_Holl%C3%A4nder "Der fliegende Holländer")*, had plainly shown me what I must set before them if I sought to please. I completely undeceived their expectations; they left the theatre, after the first performance of *[Tannhäuser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannh%C3%A4user_\(opera\) "Tannhäuser (opera)")*, \[1845\] in a confused and discontented mood. – The feeling of utter loneliness in which I now found myself, quite unmanned me... My *Tannhäuser* had appealed to a handful of intimate friends alone.[^footnotewagner1994336%e2%80%93337-12]

Finally Wagner announces:

> I shall never write an *Opera* more. As I have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works, I will call them Dramas ...
> 
> I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy Prelude (Vorspiel). ...
> 
> At a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three Dramas with their Prelude, *in the course of three days and a fore-evening*. The object of this production I shall consider thoroughly attained, if I and my artistic comrades, the actual performers, shall within these four evenings succeed in *artistically conveying my purpose to the true Emotional* (not the Critical) *Understanding* of spectators who shall have gathered together expressly to learn it.[^footnotewagner1994p._391_and_n.-13]

This is his first public announcement of the form of what would become the *Ring* cycle.

In accordance with the ideas expressed in his essays of the period 1849–51 (including the "Communication" but also "[Opera and Drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_and_Drama "Opera and Drama")" and "[The Artwork of the Future](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artwork_of_the_Future "The Artwork of the Future")"), the four parts of the *Ring* were originally conceived by Wagner to be free of the traditional operatic concepts of [aria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria "Aria") and operatic [chorus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir "Choir"). The Wagner scholar Curt von Westernhagen identified three important problems discussed in "Opera and Drama" which were particularly relevant to the *Ring* cycle: the problem of unifying verse stress with melody; the disjunctions caused by formal arias in dramatic structure and the way in which opera music could be organised on a different basis of organic growth and [modulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_\(music\) "Modulation (music)"); and the function of musical motifs in linking elements of the plot whose connections might otherwise be inexplicit. This became known as the [leitmotif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif "Leitmotif") technique (see below), although Wagner himself did not use this word.[^footnoteburbidgesutton1979345%e2%80%93346-14]

However, Wagner relaxed some aspects of his self-imposed restrictions somewhat as the work progressed. As [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "George Bernard Shaw") sardonically (and slightly unfairly)[^footnotemillington200880-15] noted of the last opera *Götterdämmerung*:

> And now, O Nibelungen Spectator, pluck up; for all allegories come to an end somewhere... The rest of what you are going to see is opera and nothing but opera. Before many bars have been played, Siegfried and the wakened Brynhild, newly become tenor and soprano, will sing a concerted [cadenza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadenza "Cadenza"); plunge on from that to a magnificent love duet...The work which follows, entitled *Night Falls on the Gods* \[Shaw's translation of *Götterdämmerung*\], is a thorough grand opera.[^footnoteshaw1898section:_%22back_to_opera_again%22-16]

As a significant element in the *Ring* and his subsequent works, Wagner adopted the use of [leitmotifs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif "Leitmotif"), which are recurring themes or [harmonic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony "Harmony") progressions. They musically denote an action, object, emotion, character, or other subject mentioned in the text or presented onstage. Wagner referred to them in "Opera and Drama" as "guides-to-feeling", describing how they could be used to inform the listener of a musical or dramatic subtext to the action onstage in the same way as a [Greek chorus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_chorus "Greek chorus") did for the [theatre of ancient Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece "Theatre of ancient Greece").

Wagner made significant innovations in [orchestration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration "Orchestration") in this work. He wrote for a very large orchestra, using the whole range of instruments used singly or in combination to express the great range of emotion and events of the drama. Wagner even commissioned the production of new instruments, including the [Wagner tuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_tuba "Wagner tuba"), invented to fill a gap he found between the tone qualities of the [horn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_horn "French horn") and the [trombone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombone "Trombone"), as well as variations of existing instruments, such as the [bass trumpet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_trumpet "Bass trumpet") and a [contrabass trombone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabass_trombone "Contrabass trombone") with a double slide. He also developed the "Wagner bell", enabling the [bassoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon "Bassoon") to reach the low A-natural, whereas normally B-flat is the instrument's lowest note. If such a bell is not to be used, then a [contrabassoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabassoon "Contrabassoon") should be employed.

All four parts have a very similar instrumentation. The core ensemble of instruments are one [piccolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccolo "Piccolo"), three [flutes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_concert_flute "Western concert flute") (third doubling second [piccolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccolo "Piccolo")), three [oboes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oboe "Oboe"), [cor anglais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cor_anglais "Cor anglais") (doubling fourth oboe), three [soprano clarinets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soprano_clarinet "Soprano clarinet"), one [bass clarinet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_clarinet "Bass clarinet"), three [bassoons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon "Bassoon"); eight [horns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_horn "French horn") (fifth through eighth doubling [Wagner tubas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_tuba "Wagner tuba")), three [trumpets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet "Trumpet"), one bass trumpet, three [tenor trombones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor_trombone "Tenor trombone"), one [contrabass trombone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabass_trombone "Contrabass trombone") (doubling [bass trombone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_trombone "Bass trombone")), one [contrabass tuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabass_tuba "Contrabass tuba"); a percussion section with 4 [timpani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timpani "Timpani") (requiring two players), [triangle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_\(musical_instrument\) "Triangle (musical instrument)"), [cymbals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbal "Cymbal"), [tam-tam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam-tam "Tam-tam"); six [harps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harp "Harp") and a string section consisting of 16 first and 16 second [violins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin "Violin"), 12 [violas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola "Viola"), 12 [cellos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello "Cello") and 8 [double basses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass "Double bass").

*Das Rheingold*, one offstage harp and 18 offstage [anvils](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil "Anvil"). *Die Walküre* requires one [snare drum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum "Snare drum"), one [D clarinet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_clarinet "D clarinet") (played by the third clarinettist) and an on-stage [steerhorn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steerhorn "Steerhorn"). *Siegfried* requires one onstage cor anglais and one onstage horn. *Götterdämmerung* requires a [tenor drum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor_drum "Tenor drum"), as well as five onstage horns and four onstage steerhorns, one of them to be blown by Hagen.[^17]

Much of the *Ring*, especially from *Siegfried* act 3 onwards, cannot be said to be in traditional, clearly defined [keys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_\(music\) "Key (music)") for long stretches, but rather in 'key regions', each of which flows smoothly into the following. This fluidity avoided the musical equivalent of clearly defined musical paragraphs and assisted Wagner in building the work's huge structures. Tonal indeterminacy was heightened by the increased freedom with which he used [dissonance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance "Consonance and dissonance") and [chromaticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaticism "Chromaticism"). Chromatically altered [chords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_\(music\) "Chord (music)") are used very liberally in the *Ring* and this feature, which is also prominent in *[Tristan und Isolde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde "Tristan und Isolde")*, is often cited as a milestone on the way to [Arnold Schoenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg "Arnold Schoenberg")'s revolutionary break with the traditional concept of key and his dissolution of consonance as the basis of an organising principle in music.

In summer 1848 Wagner wrote *The Nibelung Myth as Sketch for a Drama*, combining the medieval sources previously mentioned into a single narrative, very similar to the plot of the eventual *Ring* cycle, but nevertheless with substantial differences. Later that year he began writing a libretto entitled *Siegfrieds Tod* ("Siegfried's Death"). He was possibly stimulated by a series of articles in the *[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Zeitschrift_f%C3%BCr_Musik "Neue Zeitschrift für Musik")*, inviting composers to write a 'national opera' based on the [Nibelungenlied](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied "Nibelungenlied"), a 12th-century High German poem which, since its rediscovery in 1755, had been hailed by the [German Romantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Romantics "German Romantics") as the "German [national epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_epic "National epic")". *Siegfrieds Tod* dealt with the death of Siegfried, the central heroic figure of the Nibelungenlied. The idea had occurred to others – the correspondence of [Fanny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Mendelssohn "Fanny Mendelssohn") and [Felix Mendelssohn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn "Felix Mendelssohn") in 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios on the subject: Fanny wrote 'The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act'.[^18]

By 1850, Wagner had completed a musical sketch (which he abandoned) for *Siegfrieds Tod*.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> He now felt that he needed a preliminary opera, *Der junge Siegfried* ("The Young Siegfried", later renamed to "Siegfried"), to explain the events in *Siegfrieds Tod* and his verse draft of this was completed in May 1851.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> By October, he had made the momentous decision to embark on a cycle of four operas, to be played over four nights: *Das Rheingold*, *Die Walküre*, *Der Junge Siegfried* and *Siegfrieds Tod*; the text for all four parts was completed in December 1852 and privately published in February 1853.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In November 1853, Wagner began the composition draft of *Das Rheingold*. Unlike the verses, which were written as it were in reverse order, the music would be composed in the same order as the narrative. Composition proceeded until 1857, when the final score up to the end of act 2 of *Siegfried* was completed. Wagner then laid the work aside for twelve years, during which he wrote *[Tristan und Isolde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde "Tristan und Isolde")* and *[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg")*.

By 1869, Wagner was living at [Tribschen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribschen "Tribschen") on [Lake Lucerne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne "Lake Lucerne"), sponsored by King [Ludwig II of Bavaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria "Ludwig II of Bavaria"). He returned to *Siegfried* and, remarkably, was able to pick up where he left off. In October, he completed the final work in the cycle. He chose the title *Götterdämmerung* instead of *Siegfrieds Tod*. In the completed work the gods are destroyed in accordance with the new pessimistic thrust of the cycle, not redeemed as in the more optimistic originally planned ending. Wagner also decided to show onstage the events of *Das Rheingold* and *Die Walküre*, which had hitherto only been presented as back-narration in the other two parts. These changes resulted in some discrepancies in the cycle, but these do not diminish the value of the work.
