The [municipality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality "Municipality") of Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the [fourth largest city in Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Switzerland "List of cities in Switzerland") after [Basel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel "Basel"), [Geneva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva "Geneva"), and [Zurich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich "Zurich"), with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Agglomeration-11"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The [metropolitan area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area "Metropolitan area") of Lausanne-Geneva (including [Vevey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vevey "Vevey") - [Montreux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreux "Montreux"), [Yverdon-les-Bains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yverdon-les-Bains "Yverdon-les-Bains"), [Valais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais "Valais") and foreign parts), commonly designated as *[Arc lémanique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Geneva_region "Lake Geneva region")* was over 1.3 million inhabitants in 2017 and is the fastest growing in Switzerland.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

Initially a Celtic and Roman settlement on the shores of the lake, Lausanne became a town at the foot of [Notre Dame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_Cathedral "Lausanne Cathedral"), a cathedral built in the 12th century. In the 20th century, Lausanne became a focus of international sport, hosting the [International Olympic Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee") (which has recognized the city as the "Olympic Capital" since 1994),<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> the [Court of Arbitration for Sport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport "Court of Arbitration for Sport") and some 55 international sport associations.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> It lies in a noted wine-growing region.

Saint-François Square, c. 1840

After the fall of the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire"), insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the [Counts of Savoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Savoy "County of Savoy") and the [Bishop of Lausanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Lausanne "Bishop of Lausanne").

From 888 to 1032, the initially relatively small town belonged to the kingdom of [Upper Burgundy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Burgundy "Upper Burgundy"). During the 11th century, Lausanne developed into a political, economic and religious center. The city became the center of the secular rule of the bishops. In the period that followed, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries, Lausanne flourished. Finally, in 1275, the [Lausanne Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_Cathedral "Lausanne Cathedral") was consecrated in the presence of Pope Gregory X and [King Rudolf I of Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_I_of_Germany "Rudolf I of Germany").

It was invaded by forces from the canton of [Bern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern "Bern") and remained under their domination from 1536 to 1798. The iconoclastic Bernese stripped the Lausanne cathedral of its Roman Catholic trappings, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the cathedral, were permanently removed.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them, but they never were returned.

After the [revocation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau "Edict of Fontainebleau") of the [Edict of Nantes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes "Edict of Nantes") in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French [Huguenots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot "Huguenot"). In 1729, a seminary was opened by [Antoine Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Court "Antoine Court") and [Benjamin Duplan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Duplan "Benjamin Duplan"). By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at [Montauban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauban "Montauban") in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> During the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss [canton of Vaud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Vaud "Canton of Vaud") under which it joined the [Swiss Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federation "Swiss Federation").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-HDS-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1923, the city was the venue for the signing of the [Treaty of Lausanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne "Treaty of Lausanne"), which established the modern Turkish Republic.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.

From the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, [Spaniards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_people "Spanish people") and [Portuguese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people") immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial suburb of [Renens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renens "Renens").

The city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, [T. S. Eliot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot "T. S. Eliot") composed most of his 1922 poem *[The Waste Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land "The Waste Land")* ("by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway "Ernest Hemingway") also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people – such as historian [Edward Gibbon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibbon "Edward Gibbon") and Romantic era poets [Shelley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley "Percy Bysshe Shelley") and [Byron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron "Lord Byron") – have sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>

The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the Lôzane Bouge protests demanded the city "open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street".<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Protests occurred in 2003, against the [G8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8 "G8") meetings.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>

In June 2022, Lausanne launched Plateforme 10, an art district comprising three museums. The trio of museums included Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts (MCBA), Photo Elysée, and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts (MUDAC).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>

The agglomeration of Lausanne, Lake Geneva and the Alps

The most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (*Le Léman* in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the [Swiss plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_plateau "Swiss plateau"), with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering [Le Mont-sur-Lausanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Mont-sur-Lausanne "Le Mont-sur-Lausanne") and [Épalinges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89palinges "Épalinges"). Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Swiss and Savoyan [Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Alps "Swiss Alps").

In addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the [Flon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Flon_\(Lausanne\) "Le Flon (Lausanne)"), which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present *Rue Centrale*, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, tourists should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street in which they are trying to go. The name *[Flon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne-Flon_station "Lausanne-Flon station")* is also used for the [metro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_Metro "Lausanne Metro") station located in the gorge.

The municipality includes the villages of [Vidy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidy "Vidy"), Cour, [Ouchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouchy "Ouchy"), Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-à-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the [exclave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclave "Exclave") of Vernand.

Lausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of [Lavaux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavaux "Lavaux") (to the east) and [la Côte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_C%C3%B4te "La Côte") (to the west).

Lausanne has an area, as of 2014, of 41.38–41.37 square kilometers (15.98–15.97 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.22 km <sup>2</sup> (2.40 sq mi) or 15.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.06 km <sup>2</sup> (6.20 sq mi) or 38.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 19.00 km <sup>2</sup> (7.34 sq mi) or 45.9% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.08 km <sup>2</sup> (20 acres) or 0.2% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km <sup>2</sup> (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-BFS_land-27"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>

Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 22.8% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.4%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.6% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.4%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 9.4% is used for growing crops and 4.9% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes and streams.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-BFS_land-27"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup>

The municipality was part of the old [Lausanne District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_District "Lausanne District") until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the region capital of the new district of Lausanne.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Mutation-28"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>

Lausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of [precipitation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_\(meteorology\) "Precipitation (meteorology)"). The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-ClimatPUY1-29"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> The USDA [Hardiness Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_Zone "Hardiness Zone") for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of −7.0 C over the past 20 years (1997–2016).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup>
