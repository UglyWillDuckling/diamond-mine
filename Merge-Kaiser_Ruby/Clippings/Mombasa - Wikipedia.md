**Mombasa** ([/ m ɒ m ˈ b æ s ə /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")[*mom- BASS -ə*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); also [US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English"): [/- ˈ b ɑː s ə /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")[*\-⁠ BAH -sə*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is a coastal city in southeastern [Kenya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya "Kenya") along the [Indian Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"). It was the first capital of [British East Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_Africa "British East Africa"), before [Nairobi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi "Nairobi") was elevated to capital status in 1907. It now serves as the capital of [Mombasa County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_County "Mombasa County"). The town is known as "the white and blue city" in Kenya. It is the country's oldest (c. 900 A.D.) and second-largest [city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Kenya "List of cities in Kenya")[^3] after Nairobi, with a population of about 1,208,333 people according to the 2019 census.[^1]

Mombasa's location on the Indian Ocean made it a historical trading centre,[^4] and it has been controlled by many countries because of its strategic location. Kenyan school history books place the founding of Mombasa as 900 A.D.[^5] It must have been already a prosperous trading town in the 12th century, as the Arab geographer [al-Idrisi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Idrisi "Muhammad al-Idrisi") mentions it in 1151. It was a part of the [Kilwa Sultanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwa_Sultanate "Kilwa Sultanate") from approximately the early 14th century until the dissolution of the sultanate in 1513 A.D. The oldest stone mosque in Mombasa, Mnara, was built c. 1300. The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific [ogee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogee "Ogee") arch. The city later came under the occupation and control of the [Omani Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omani_Empire "Omani Empire") in the late 17th century.

In the late pre-colonial period, it was the metropolis of a plantation society, which became dependent on slave labour based around the ivory trade. Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far reaching Indian Ocean trading networks. Its key exports then were ivory, [millet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet "Millet"), [sesamum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamum "Sesamum") and [coconuts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut "Coconut").

Today, Mombasa is a tourism-based town, home to one of the [state houses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_House_\(Kenya\) "State House (Kenya)"), with an extra-large [port](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaport "Seaport") and an [international airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moi_International_Airport "Moi International Airport").

### Ancient and medieval

The founding of Mombasa is associated with two rulers: Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita. According to legend, Mwana Mkisi is the original ancestor of Mombasa's oldest lineages within *Thenashara Taifa* (or Twelve Nations). Families associated with the Twelve Nations are still considered the original inhabitants of the city. Mwana Mkisi was a queen from the pre-Islamic era, who founded Kongowea, the original urban settlement on Mombasa Island.

Significantly, the names of both the queen and the city have linguistic and spiritual connections with [Central Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa "Central Africa"). "Mkisi" is considered the personification of *"ukisi"*, which means "the holy" in [kiKongo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiKongo "KiKongo"). "Kongowea" can similarly be interpreted as the Swahili locative of *"kongo"*, which denotes the essence of civilizational order in central Africa. These legends can be read as an acknowledgement of the [Bantu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages "Bantu languages")\-speaking origins of the [Swahili people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_people "Swahili people").

Shehe Mvitaff superseded the dynasty of Mwana Mkisi and established the first permanent stone mosque on Mombasa Island. Mombasa's oldest extant stone mosque, Mnara, was built c. 1300. Shehe Mvita is remembered as a Muslim of great learning and so is connected more directly with the present ideals of Swahili culture that people identify with Mombasa. The ancient history associated with Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita and the founding of an urban settlement on Mombasa Island is still linked to present-day peoples living in Mombasa. The Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations) Swahili lineages recount this ancient history today and are the keepers of local Swahili traditions.[^6]

Most of the early information on Mombasa comes from the writings of [Portuguese chroniclers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people") in the 16th century.

The famous Moroccan scholar and traveller [Ibn Battuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Battuta "Ibn Battuta") (1304 – 1368/1369) visited the area during his travels to the [Swahili Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_Coast "Swahili Coast"). He noted the city, although he stayed only one night. He wrote that the people of Mombasa were [Shafi'i](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi%27i "Shafi'i") Muslims, religious people, trustworthy and righteous. Their mosques were made of wood, expertly built.[^7]

The exact founding date of the city is unknown, but it has a long history. Kenyan school history books place the founding of Mombasa as 900 A.D.[^5] It must have been already a prosperous trading town in the 12th century, as the Arab geographer [al-Idrisi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Idrisi "Muhammad al-Idrisi") mentions it in 1151. The oldest stone mosque in Mombasa, Mnara, was built c. 1300. The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific ogee arch. This suggests that Swahili architecture was an indigenous African product rather than being adopted from non-African Muslims who brought stone architecture to the Swahili Coast.[^8]

During the pre-modern period, Mombasa was an important centre for the trade in spices, gold, and [ivory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory "Ivory"). Its trade links reached as far as India and China. Oral historians today can still recount this period of local history. Indian history shows that there were trade links between Mombasa and [Cholas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholas "Cholas") of [South India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India "South India"). Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far-reaching Indian Ocean trading networks. Its key exports were ivory, [millet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet "Millet"), [sesamum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamum "Sesamum") and [coconuts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut "Coconut").

Ivory caravans remained a major source of economic prosperity. Mombasa became the major port city of pre-colonial Kenya in the Middle Ages and was used to trade with other African port cities, the [Persian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran "Greater Iran"), the Arabian Peninsula, India and China.[^9]

Sixteenth-century Portuguese voyager [Duarte Barbosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duarte_Barbosa "Duarte Barbosa") wrote,

> "\[Mombasa\] is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from [Sofala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofala "Sofala") and others which come from [Cambay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khambhat "Khambhat") and [Melinde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malindi "Malindi") and others which sail to the island of [Zanzibar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar "Zanzibar")."[^10]

### Portuguese domination

See also: [Battle of Mombasa (1505)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mombasa_\(1505\) "Battle of Mombasa (1505)") and [Battle of Mombasa (1528)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mombasa_\(1528\) "Battle of Mombasa (1528)")

Mombasa was under [Portuguese rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire") from 1593 to 1698 and again from 1728 to 1729. Portuguese presence in Kenya lasted from 1498 until 1730.

[Vasco da Gama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama "Vasco da Gama") was the first known European to visit Mombasa, receiving a chilly reception in 1498.[^11] Two years later, the town was sacked by the Portuguese. In 1502, the [sultanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate "Sultanate") became independent from [Kilwa Kisiwani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwa_Kisiwani "Kilwa Kisiwani") and was renamed as Mvita (in [Swahili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language")) or Manbasa ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language")).

The [Portuguese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire") had since had encounters with the city several times; first under [Francisco de Almeida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Almeida "Francisco de Almeida") in 1505, later under [Afonso de Albuquerque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque "Afonso de Albuquerque") in 1522 to quell an attempted mutiny by the sultan's nephew in Pemba and Zanzibar, and finally the destruction of the city under [Nuno da Cunha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_da_Cunha "Nuno da Cunha") again in 1528 after the Malindi sultan failed to pay [tribute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute "Tribute").[^12]

In 1585, a military expedition of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), led by Emir 'Ali Bey, successfully captured Mombasa, and other coastal cities in Southeast Africa from the Portuguese.[^13] However, [Malindi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malindi "Malindi") remained loyal to Portugal. The Zimba overcame the towns of Sena and Tete on the Zambezi, and in 1587 they took [Kilwa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwa "Kilwa"), killing 3,000 people. At Mombasa, the Zimba slaughtered the Muslim inhabitants, but they were halted at Malindi by the Bantu-speaking [Segeju](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segeju "Segeju") and went home. This stimulated the Portuguese to take over Mombasa a third time in 1589, and four years later they built Fort Jesus to administer the region. Between Lake Malawi and the Zambezi mouth, Kalonga Mzura made an alliance with the Portuguese in 1608 and fielded 4,000 warriors to help defeat their rival Zimba, who were led by chief Lundi.

After the building of [Fort Jesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Jesus "Fort Jesus"), Mombasa was put by the Portuguese under the rule of members of the ruling family of Malindi. In 1631 [Dom Jeronimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_ibn_al-Hasan "Yusuf ibn al-Hasan"), the ruler of Mombasa, slaughtered the Portuguese garrison in the city and defeated the relief force sent by the Portuguese. In 1632 Dom Jeronimo left Mombasa and became a pirate. That year the Portuguese returned and established direct rule over Mombasa.[^14]

### Omani rule

With the [capture of Fort Jesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_Jesus "Siege of Fort Jesus") in 1698, the town came under the influence of the [Imamate of Oman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imamate_of_Oman "Imamate of Oman"), subordinate to the Omani rulers on the island of [Unguja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unguja "Unguja"), prompting regular local rebellions. Oman appointed three consecutive Governors (Wali in Arabic, [Liwali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwali "Liwali") in [Swahili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language")):

- 12 December 1698 – December 1698: Imam Sa'if ibn Sultan
- December 1698 – 1728: Nasr ibn Abdallah al-Mazru'i
- 1728–12 March 1728: Shaykh Rumba

Mombasa was briefly returned to Portuguese rule by captain-major Álvaro Caetano de Melo Castro (12 March 1728 – 21 September 1729), then four new Omani Liwali until 1746, when the last of them made it independent again (disputed by Oman), as the first of its recorded Sultans:

- 1746–1755: 'Ali ibn Uthman al-Mazru'i
- 1755–1773: Masud ibn Nasr al-Mazru'i
- 1773–1782: Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mazru'i
- 1782–1811: Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Mazru'i (born 17–died 1814)
- 1812–1823: 'Abdallah ibn Ahmad al-Mazru'i (died 1823)
- 1823–1826: Sulayman ibn 'Ali al-Mazru'i

C. 1953 – A newly constructed East African Railways Beyer Garratt locomotive being unloaded at Mombasa

From 9 February 1824 to 25 July 1826, there was a [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire")[protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate "Protectorate") over Mombasa, represented by governors. Omani rule was restored in 1826; seven *liwalis* where appointed. On 24 June 1837, it was nominally [annexed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexed "Annexed") by [Said bin Sultan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Said_bin_Sultan "Said bin Sultan") of [Muscat and Oman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat_and_Oman "Muscat and Oman").

### British rule and independence

On 25 May 1887 Mombasa was relinquished to the British East Africa Association, later the [Imperial British East Africa Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_British_East_Africa_Company "Imperial British East Africa Company"). It came under British administration in 1895.[^15]It soon became the capital of the [British East Africa Protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_Africa_Protectorate "British East Africa Protectorate") and the sea terminal of the [Uganda Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Railway "Uganda Railway"), construction of which was started in 1896. Many workers were brought in from [British India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_India "British India") to build the railway, and the city's fortunes revived. The [Sultan of Zanzibar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_of_Zanzibar "Sultan of Zanzibar") formally presented the town to the British in 1898.

Mombasa became the capital of the [Kenya Colony Protectorate of Kenya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kenya_Colony_Protectorate_of_Kenya&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kenya Colony Protectorate of Kenya (page does not exist)"), sometime between 1887 and around 1906.[^16] The capital was later moved because medical officers warned that the ground was swampy, and urged Sir [James Hayes Sadler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hayes_Sadler "James Hayes Sadler"), then Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate, to plead with London to move the town elsewhere to mitigate potential disease. [Nairobi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi "Nairobi") has since been Kenya's capital to date.[^17]

The [Mombasa tusks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_tusks "Mombasa tusks"), one of the city's best-known monuments, were originally constructed in 1952 by the British administration of the [Kenya Colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Colony "Kenya Colony"), commemorating the visit of [Queen Elizabeth II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II "Queen Elizabeth II") to the city.[^18][^19]

In 2018, as part of an effort to increase tourism, Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho issued a directive requiring that all buildings in the Old Town and the Central Business District be painted white with [Egyptian blue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_blue "Egyptian blue") trim and banned all signs from their walls or canopies. Transport, Infrastructure and Public Works County Executive Tawfiq Balala stated that the city wanted to be "the most photographed in Africa".[^20]

## Geography

Map of Mombasa's extent.

Being a [coastal town](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_town "Coastal town"), Mombasa is characterised by a flat topography. The town of Mombasa is centred on [Mombasa Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_Island "Mombasa Island"), but extends to the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by two [creeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_\(tidal\) "Creek (tidal)"), [Port Reitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Reitz "Port Reitz") in the south and [Tudor Creek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_Creek "Tudor Creek") in the north.

## Climate

Mombasa has a [tropical wet and dry climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_wet_and_dry_climate "Tropical wet and dry climate") ([Köppen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen-Geiger_climate_classification_system "Köppen-Geiger climate classification system"): *As*; [Trewartha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trewartha_climate_classification "Trewartha climate classification"): *Asha*). The amount of rainfall essentially depends on the season. The rainiest months are April and May, while rainfall is minimal between January and February.

Located near the equator, Mombasa has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging 28.8–33.7 °C (83.8–92.7 °F).

As a seaport, Mombasa is subject to detrimental consequences of a fluctuating climate. In October 2006, Mombasa experienced a large flood that affected 60,000 people.[^21]

[Like the rest of Kenya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Kenya "Climate change in Kenya"), climate change is already creating challenges for the city: [coastal erosion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion "Coastal erosion") has become a problem for infrastructure in Mombasa. Due to [rising sea levels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise"), the coastline has been eroding at 2.5–20 cm (0.98–7.87 in) per year. This has increased the number of annual floods.[^21]

## Suburbs

This fringe community lacks any effective electricity, water or sewer systems, with a general lack of infrastructure. Poverty, lack of sanitation, and unemployment continue to be the greatest issues for the Mikindani Township, which have ensured low health and safety standards for its residents. Poor, lower class housing is widespread, ranging from simple stone, two-storey structures to mud and earth homes fitted with corrugated iron roofs. Much of the community works outside of the township, within Mombasa Island itself as there is a lack of employment and industry. There are a number of small health clinics, shops, and a few public primary schools: Nazarene primary is one school, which is known in particular as being staffed by a revolving volunteer teacher base from Western, and predominately English speaking nations. This small town serves as a link between the city and Moi International Airport. Magongo is also home to the Akamba Handicraft Cooperative.

Mombasa is an important economic centre in Kenya. In addition to the coffee trade, the food and chemical industries, there is a steel mill, an aluminum rolling mill, an oil refinery and a cement plant. The city is home to the most important seaport in East Africa, [Kilindini Harbour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilindini_Harbour "Kilindini Harbour"), which is also used by the neighbouring countries Tanzania and Uganda for their imports and exports.

*Kilindini* is an old Swahili term meaning "deep". The port is so-called because the channel is naturally very deep. Kilindini Harbour is an example of a natural geographic phenomenon called a [ria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ria "Ria"), formed at the end of the [last glacial period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period "Last glacial period") when the sea level rose and engulfed a river that was flowing from the mainland.

Mombasa is a centre of coastal tourism in Kenya. Mombasa Island itself is not a main attraction, although many people visit the Old Town and [Fort Jesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Jesus "Fort Jesus"). The [Nyali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyali "Nyali"), [Bamburi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamburi "Bamburi"), and [Shanzu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanzu "Shanzu") beaches are located north of the city. The [Shelly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shelly_Beach,_Kenya&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shelly Beach, Kenya (page does not exist)"), [Tiwi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi,_Kenya "Tiwi, Kenya"), and [Diani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diani_Beach "Diani Beach") beaches are located south of Mombasa. Several luxury hotels exist on these beaches, while the less expensive hotels are located further away.

Mombasa's northern shoreline is renowned for its vibrant 24-hour entertainment offers, including both family entertainment (water parks, cinemas, [bowling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling "Bowling"), etc.), sports ([watersports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watersports "Watersports"), [mountain biking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking "Mountain biking") and [gokarting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokarting "Gokarting")), culinary offers (restaurants offering a wide range of specialties from Kenya, China, Japan, India, Italy, Germany and other countries) and nightlife (bars, pubs, clubs, discothèques, etc.).

Other local industries include an [oil refinery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery "Oil refinery") with a capacity of 80,000 barrels (13 ML) a day,[^34] and a cement factory capable of producing over 1.1 million tons per year.[^35] The major intercontinental undersea telecom cables reach shore next to Mombasa, connecting the [African Great Lakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Great_Lakes "African Great Lakes") to the rest of the world and supporting a fast-growing [call centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre "Call centre") business in the area. The estimated real GDP growth for Kenya in 2016 is 5.7-6.0%. This growth will be in response to the construction of a railway system from Nairobi to Mombasa which will aid in trade and transportation between Kenya's two major cities.[^36]

Mombasa will become a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in which certain industries such as tea, garments, and footwear will be exempt from certain taxes to promote domestic growth. This is in response to the deficiencies in Export Processing Zones (EPZ).[^36]

The Kenyan Dock Worker's Union is situated in Mombasa and has roughly 5,000 members.[^36]

President Kenyatta has made it a priority to deepen economic ties with Asia at the onset of his presidency. Japan has played a role in financially sponsoring the expansion of the Mombasa port in phase one and two of the expansion project.[^36]

At 44%, the rate of youth unemployment in Mombasa is more than double the national average of 21% (2016).[^37]

### Rail

Mombasa has a modern railway station on the [Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa%E2%80%93Nairobi_Standard_Gauge_Railway "Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway") that replaced the [narrow-gauge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-gauge_railway "Narrow-gauge railway")[Uganda Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Railway "Uganda Railway") completed in 1901 under British colonial rule.[^40] Completed in 2017 and located at [Miritini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miritini "Miritini"), the [Mombasa Terminus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_Terminus "Mombasa Terminus") station links Mombasa to Nairobi. The station, situated about 20 kilometres from the city centre, is accessible through the newly built (2018) highway, being the first phase of the Dongo Kundu bypass. [Kenya Railways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Railways "Kenya Railways") transports passengers and cargo through the Standard Gauge Railway between Nairobi to Mombasa.[^41]

### Road

Driving in Mombasa is straightforward and the majority of the roads are tarmacked. The [Mombasa–Nairobi Expressway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa%E2%80%93Nairobi_Expressway "Mombasa–Nairobi Expressway") connects Mombasa to the capital city Nairobi.[^42]

Within Mombasa, most local people use *[matatus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matatu "Matatu")* (mini-buses) which are extremely common in Kenya, to move around the city and its suburbs. The *[tuk-tuk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw "Auto rickshaw")*—a motor vehicle with three wheels—is widely used as transport around the city and its suburbs. No more than three passengers may be carried. A *[boda-boda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda-boda "Boda-boda")* is originally a bicycle taxi but have long since been replaced by motorcycles.[^43]

### Sea

The port of Mombasa is the largest in East Africa, with 19 [deep water berths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-water_port "Deep-water port") with two additional berths nearing completion and two [oil terminals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_terminal "Oil terminal").[^44] The port is connected by rail and road to the interior.[^44] At present there is little or no scheduled passenger service from the port, however, international cruise ships frequent the port. The port is part of the [21st Century Maritime Silk Road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Maritime_Silk_Road "21st Century Maritime Silk Road") that runs from the Chinese coast to the Upper Adriatic region. In connection with the Silk Road Initiative, China has started infrastructure development projects in Kenya and is building roads, railways and public buildings on credit.[^45][^46][^47][^48][^49][^50][^51]

#### Ferry

Mombasa ferry

There is no bridge between Mombasa Island and the south coast, instead the route is served by [ferries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry "Ferry") operated by the Kenya Ferry Service from Kilindini and Mtongwe to [Likoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likoni "Likoni") in the south coast of Mombasa. The last major accident occurred in 1994 when a ferry serving Mtongwe route sank killing more than 270 people.[^52]

As a result of the increase in more luxurious hotels along the south coast and a lack of a direct bridge linking with Mombasa island, visiting tourists have the option of flying directly from Nairobi into the South Coast airstrip at Ukunda.

The [Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongo_Kundu_Bypass_Highway "Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway") is under construction (as at 20128). With a total of three bridges, it will finally connect the mainland to the south coast easing the burden on the ferry services. [Mombasa Gate Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mombasa_Gate_Bridge&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mombasa Gate Bridge (page does not exist)") will connect the mainland to Likoni, this will eliminate the usage of the unsafe ferry which has claimed hundreds of lives.

## Education

The major university in the island is the [Technical University of Mombasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Mombasa "Technical University of Mombasa"). The city has a campus of [Kenyatta University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyatta_University "Kenyatta University"). Other major university campuses include [University of Nairobi-Mombasa campus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nairobi "University of Nairobi"), [Mount Kenya University-Mombasa campus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kenya_University "Mount Kenya University"), [JKUAT-Mombasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomo_Kenyatta_University_of_Agriculture_and_Technology "Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology"), Shanzu Teachers Training College, Mombasa Technical College, Bandari college, Utalii college, and ICS college Mombasa.

According to local folklore, the cave-temple was found a long time ago when a group of local herders were puzzled after they noticed that one of their cows regularly released all of her milk at a specific yet random spot on the hills. They are then said to have approached some Hindu families living in the area to ask if they had any idea behind the strange behaviour by the cow. The group then teamed up, made their way to the spot and started digging. That is how they ended up stumbling into the cave where they found a 'Shiva [Lingam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam "Lingam")' – an abstract representation of the Hindu God Lord Shiva, whose vehicle is [Nandi (mythology)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandi_\(mythology\) "Nandi (mythology)").
