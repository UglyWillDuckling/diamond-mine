The ***Ride of the Valkyries*** (German: *Walkürenritt or Ritt der Walküren*) is the popular name of the prelude to the first scene of the third and last act of *[Die Walküre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Walk%C3%BCre "Die Walküre")*, the second of the four [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry "Epic poetry") [music dramas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikdrama "Musikdrama") that constitute [[Richard Wagner]] [Richard Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner "Richard Wagner")'s *[Der Ring des Nibelungen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen "Der Ring des Nibelungen")*.

As a separate piece, the "Ride" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the "[Bridal Chorus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridal_Chorus "Bridal Chorus")" from *[Lohengrin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lohengrin_\(opera\) "Lohengrin (opera)")*, the "Ride of the Valkyries" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.

The main theme of the "Ride", the [leitmotif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif "Leitmotif") labelled *Walkürenritt*, was first written down by the composer on 23 July 1851. The preliminary draft for the "Ride" was composed in 1854 as part of the composition of the entire opera, which was fully orchestrated by the end of March 1856.[^1]

In the *Walküre* opera, the "Ride", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight [Valkyrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie "Valkyrie") sisters of [Brünnhilde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhild "Brunhild") have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to [Valhalla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla "Valhalla"). As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the [Rhinemaidens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinemaidens "Rhinemaidens") in *[Das Rheingold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Rheingold "Das Rheingold")*, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's *Ring* cycle.

The "Ride" features as [diegetic music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegetic_music "Diegetic music") in *[Apocalypse Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now "Apocalypse Now")* (1979),[^bc2011-8] where the [1/9 Air Cavalry squadron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_Cavalry_Regiment_\(United_States\)#Vietnam_War_\(Air_Cav\) "9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)") plays it on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers[^9] during their assault on a [Viet Cong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong "Viet Cong")\-controlled village as [psychological warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare "Psychological warfare") and to motivate their own troops.[^coates-10]

Ride of the Valkyries is also featured in [Maxell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxell "Maxell")'s iconic "Blown Away Guy" cassette advertisement in the 1980s, showing a man sitting low in a chair and then a powerful wind blowing from speakers playing Ride of the Valkyries, showcasing the high quality of their cassettes.[^11]

During his run in [World Wrestling Entertainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE "WWE"), wrestler [Daniel Bryan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bryan "Daniel Bryan") used an altered version of Ride of the Valkyries as his theme song under a different name, “Flight of the Valkyries” which was produced by [Jim Johnston (composer)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Johnston_\(composer\) "Jim Johnston (composer)") and was released in 2011.[^12]
