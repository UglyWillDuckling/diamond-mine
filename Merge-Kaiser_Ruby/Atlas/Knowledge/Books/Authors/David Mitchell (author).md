Mitchell's first novel, [[Ghostwritten (1999)]], takes place in locations ranging from [[Okinawa]] to [[Mongolia]] to pre-millennial New York City, as nine narrators tell stories that interlock and intersect. It won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize (for best work of British literature written by an author under 35) and was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award.[2] His two subsequent novels, [[number9dream]] (2001) and [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]] (2004), were both favourably received and shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].[3]

In 2003, he was selected as one of Granta's Best of Young British Novelists.[4]
In 2007, Mitchell was listed among Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.


In 2012, his metafictional novel Cloud Atlas (again, with multiple narrators), was adapted as a feature film of the same name [^1].

One segment of [[number9dream]] was adapted as a short film titled [[The Voorman Problem]] and starring [[Martin Freeman]]. It was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] in 2013.[6]

In addition to novels, Mitchell has written opera libretti in recent years. Wake, with music by Klaas de Vries, was based on the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster. It was performed by the Dutch Nationale Reisopera in 2010.[7] He created the opera, Sunken Garden, with Dutch composer Michel van der Aa; it was premiered in 2013 by the English National Opera.[8]

Several of Mitchell's book covers were created by design duo [[Kai and Sunny]].[9] Mitchell has also collaborated with the duo, by contributing two short stories to their art exhibits in 2011 and 2014.[citation needed]

Mitchell's sixth novel, [[The Bone Clocks]], was published in 2014.[10] In an interview in The Spectator, Mitchell said that the novel has "dollops of the fantastic in it", and is about "stuff between life and death".[11] The Bone Clocks was longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.

Mitchell was the second author to contribute to the [[Future Library project]]. He delivered his book From Me Flows What You Call Time on 28 May 2016.

[[Utopia Avenue]], Mitchell's ninth novel, was published by [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in 2020, during the first year of the Covid 19 pandemic.[15] Utopia Avenue tells the "unexpurgated story" of a British band of the same name, who emerged from London's psychedelic scene in 1967 and was "fronted by folk singer Elf Holloway, guitar demigod Jasper de Zoet and blues bassist Dean Moss".[16]

Mitchell's entire body of fictional works feature multiple recurring characters and themes that together form an interconnected fictional world, which Mitchell refers to as his 'macronovel'.
