You can also follow this tutorial using your local development environment. To do this, you need to:


1. Install Node.js
2. In the CodeSandbox tab you opened earlier, press the top-left corner button to open the menu, and then choose Download Sandbox in that menu to download an archive of the files locally
3. Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and cd to the directory you unzipped
4. Install the dependencies with npm install
5. Run npm start to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser
If you get stuck, donâ€™t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.
