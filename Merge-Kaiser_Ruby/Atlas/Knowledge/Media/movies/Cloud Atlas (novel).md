Cloud Atlas, published in **2004**, is the third novel by British author [[David Mitchell]]. The book combines metafiction, historical fiction, contemporary fiction and science fiction, with interconnected nested stories that take the reader from the remote South Pacific in the 19th century to the island of Hawaii in a distant post-apocalyptic future. Its title references a piece of music by [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]].

# structure and style 

The book has been described as incorporating elements of metafiction,[29] [[historical fiction]], contemporary fiction, (post)apocalyptic writing and [[science fiction]] into its narrative.[30][31][32] The book's style was inspired by Italo Calvino's If on a winter's night a traveler, which contains several incomplete, interrupted narratives. Mitchell's innovation was to add a 'mirror' in the centre of his book so that each story could be brought to a conclusion.[33][3] 

Mitchell has said of the book: 

> Literally all of the main characters, except one, are reincarnations of the same soul in different bodies throughout the novel identified by a birthmark ... that's just a symbol really of the universality of human nature. The title itself Cloud Atlas, the cloud refers to the ever changing manifestations of the Atlas, which is the fixed human nature which is always thus and ever shall be. So the book's theme is predacity, the way individuals prey on individuals, groups on groups, nations on nations, tribes on tribes. So I just take this theme and in a sense reincarnate that theme in another contextÂ ...[34]
