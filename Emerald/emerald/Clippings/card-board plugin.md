## Obsidian CardBoard Plugin

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to make working with tasks a pleasure (hopefully anyway).

- Uses regular tasks/subtasks wherever they are in your vault.
- Shows them on kanban style boards.
- Two column types supported (any combination can be on a single board):
- Date based (with daily/periodic notes support).
- Tag based (use `#tags` to define columns).

## New

- No new features: I have split out some of the internal workings in preparation for drag and drop - hopefully managed this without introducing any bugs or performance issues.

## Installation

Please install via the regular Community Plugins setting tab within Obsidian.

## Use

When installed, you can launch the plugin:

- using the icon in the app ribbon (see below), or
- using the Command Pallete command (which allows you to open a specific board).

[![app ribbon icon](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/ribbonIcon.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/ribbonIcon.png?raw=true)

If you have no boards defined, you should get a dialog asking you to add a new board. You can choose from one of 3 board types to get going:

- **Date based**: looks like the main screenshot above.
- **Tag based**: includes the built-in tag based columns. You will need to add the tag columns you wish to include.
- **Empty board**: has no pre-defined columns.

These are just to get you started. You can mix date and tag based columns on the same board: use the plugin's settings to add/edit/re-order/delete columns.

## Cards

Any task in your vault can appear as a card in a column on a board. In order to do this, it must:

- Be in a markdown file.
- Not be indented - it must be at the start of the line.
- Use one of the commonmark supported unordered list formats:
- `- [ ] Task title`
- `* [ ] Task title`
- `+ [ ] Task title`

What appears on the card depends on what your task looks like:

- Anything that is indented under a task will appear in the body of the task.
- Indented tasks will appear as subtasks (all subtasks are grouped together).
- Indented text will appear as notes.
- `#tags` on the line of the task or included in the `tags` property of the note containing the task will appear at the top of the card
- Due date (if given) will appear at the bottom of the card.

So, if you had the following in one of your markdown files:

```
- [ ] run erands @due(2022-12-02)
  - [x] do shopping #town
  - [ ] wash car #home/outside
  - [ ] cook dinner #home/kitchen

  perhaps I should look up some [[example_tasks/recipes|recipes]] first

  - [ ] do something with a long title that will truncate when displayed
  - [ ] go to bed
```

It will look something like this on a card on your board:

[![example card](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/card.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/card.png?raw=true)

### Marking a task as complete

If you mark a task as complete on the board it will be marked as completed in the markdown file (and vice-versa). If you mark as complete on the board, a completion timestamp is appended to the task:

```
- [x] Task title @completed(2021-10-30T13:57:48)
```

See the [compatibility section](https://github.com/roovo/#other-plugin-compatibility) for details on how you can choose to use a format compatible with other plugins (or to choose not to add any completion text).

You can choose wether to use local or UTC time in completion timestamps via the plugin's settings (in the `Global Settings` section).

If you have subtasks and the parent task is tagged as an *autocomplete* task then the main task will be marked as complete when you tick off the final subtask:

```
- [ ] Task title @autocomplete(true)
  - [ ] Do this first
  - [ ] Do this next
  - [ ] Finally do this and you are done
```

### Deleting a task

You can delete a task using the trash icon on the card. This will not actually delete the task from your vault, it simply surrounds it with markdown `<del>` tags:

```
<del>- [x] Task title</del>
```

### Editing due date

You can change the due date of a task by right clicking on a card and selecting the only option currently available on the context menu.

You can enter the date directly in the input (uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format), use the calendar dropdown which will appear when you click in the input, or clear the date to remove the due date from the task.

### Editing tasks (and hover preview)

Click on the edit icon to open the note containing the task. Cmd (or Ctrl on windows) hover over the icon for the normal Obsidian hover preview.

### Card ordering in columns

The current behaviour for the different columns is:

- **Completed**: has the most recently completed at the top (assuming they were marked as complete using the checkbox on the board).
- **Date** & **Tag** columns are sorted by due date and then alphabetically within this.
- other columns are sorted alphabetically.

### Customising Tags

I have to recommend using the wonderful [Colorful Tag](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-colorful-tag) plugin as this will allow you to style tags on your markdown pages as well as in CardBoard.

If you would like to "roll your own", you can using a CSS snippet containing something along the lines of:

```
.card-board-view a.tag[href="#foo/bar"] {
  background-color: HotPink;
  color: DimGrey;
}
```

This will style the tag `#foo/bar` wherever it appears in the CardBoard view with your favorite color for foo/bars, which just has to be HotPink :)

### Customising Card Highlight Color

By default cards with due dates will have a colored bar on their left hand side to give a visual indication of when they are due. These colours are dependent on the theme you are using. There are two way to over-ride this, both of which require the use of [css snippets](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets).

If you wish to stick with the due date based behaviour, but would like to choose the colors, you can use a snippet along these lines:

```
/* overdue */
.card-board-view .card-board-card-highlight-area.critical {
  background-color: red;
}

/* due today */
.card-board-view .card-board-card-highlight-area.important {
  background-color: orange;
}

/* due after today */
.card-board-view .card-board-card-highlight-area.good {
  background-color: green;
}
```

If you wish to set the color based on tags, then you can use a snippet such as:

```
.card-board-card[data-tags~=status-doing] .card-board-card-highlight-area {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Which will set the color to yellow for all cards with a tag `#status/doing`. This will override any date based highlighting. If you use nested tags, you will need to replace the `/` character with a `-` (as in the example above). If the card has multiple tags which you have set different colors for, the last one read from your snippets will take priority. Tag based colors will be applied for tags even if the tags are [hidden](https://github.com/roovo/#hiding-tags).

## Boards

Boards are simply a collection of columns, which are defined either by:

- Dates (with daily/periodic notes support).
- Tags (uses `#tags` to define the column).

### Adding boards

[![add new board](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/addNewBoard.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/addNewBoard.png?raw=true)

Use the `+` icon on the settings dialog.

### Reordering boards

Boards can be reordered by dragging their tabs on the main view or dragging their name in the list on the settings pane.

### Date columns

You will get the best out of these if you are using the (core) Daily Notes or the (community) Periodic Notes plugins, as any tasks you place on a daily note will be assigned to the day of the note. If you do not want this behaviour you can turn it off in the Global Settings pane, then tasks on daily notes pages will not have a due date unless one is specified on the line of the task.

[![filters](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/ignoreFileNameDatesSetting.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/ignoreFileNameDatesSetting.png?raw=true)

You can assign a date to any task using the format:

```
- [ ] My task @due(2021-10-31)
```

Cardboard also understands the format used by Dataview and Tasks:

```
- [ ] My task [due:: 2021-10-31]
- [x] My task ðŸ“… 2021-10-31 âœ… 2025-01-10
```

A due date specified on a task line will overide any date derived from a task being on a daily note page.

You can turn off the due date for a specific task on a daily note page:

#### Overdue tasks

In the default Date Board, these will appear in the `Today` column above any any tasks that are actually due today.

The idea being that it will get steadily more annoying to see what you were planning to do today if you have a lot of incomplete tasks from previous days, (hopefully) encouraging you to do something about them; like do them or move them to a future date if you want to schedule them later.

If you prefer to have overdue tasks in their own column you can configure this in the settings:

[![date board column settings](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/dateBoardColumnsSettings.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/dateBoardColumnsSettings.png?raw=true)

This shows the 3 types of date based columns you can use: `Before`, `Between`, and `After`. Each of these use relative dates, where 0 means today, so:

- `Between -1 and -1` means yesterday
- `Between 0 and 0` means today
- `Between 1 and 1` means tomorrow
- `Before 0` means before today (overdue)
- `After 1` means after tomorrow

The only other date based column you can include is an *Undated* column, which will include all tasks which have no due date. You cannot have more than one *Undated* column on a board.

### Tag columns

If you give your tasks tags, you can use these to set up tag columns. So if you have the tags `#status/backlog`, `#status/triaged`, `status/blocked`, `#status/doing`, you can define a board that shows tasks tagged with these in separate columns:

[![tag board settings](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/tagBoardSettings.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/tagBoardSettings.png?raw=true)

You do not need to inclue the `#` character at the start of the tag when defining which tag shold be used for a column.

#### Subtags

If you specify a tag with a trailing `/` in the settings for the column, then the column will contain all tasks which have subtags of the tag, as well as those with the *base* tag.

#### Sub-tasks

Tasks with sub-tasks that have matching tags will also appear on the board.

#### Tag Properties

If you want to give all the tasks on a page the same tag, you can put it in the properties of a note:

```
---
tags:
  - recipe
  - cooking
---

# Project 1

- [ ] this task will automatically have the recipe and cooking tags
```

#### Hiding Tags

If you don't want to see the tags used to configure the board's columns on the cards, you can show/hide them in the settings. If you choose not to show the column tags, this will hide the tags defined for columns wherever cards are on the board. Only tags that exactly match those used in the settings will be hidden.

The other types of tag based columns are:

- Other Tags: include any tasks with tags that are not in one of the defined tag-based columns.
- Untagged: for any tasks which have no tags.

You cannot have more that one of each of these on a board.

### Completed column

You can include a complted column on your board. This will only include completed tasks that would have appeared in one of the other columns had it not been completed; i.e. it only contains tasks that *belong* on the board.

Where you have columns based on tags and a task is shown in a column due to tags on sub-tasks it will only show in that column if those subtasks are incomplete. So the following task is shown only in the *Barney* column as the *Wilma* sub-task is complete:

[![wilma_barney](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/wilma_barney.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/wilma_barney.png?raw=true)

This does mean that a card can appear in the completed column even if the top level task is not complete, e.g for the above example if the *Barney* task is marked as complete the card will move to the *Completed* column:

[![wilma_barney_completed](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/wilma_barney_completed.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/wilma_barney_completed.png?raw=true)

You cannot have more than one Completed column on a board.

### Board Filters

You can filter which tasks appear on each board in the board settings. There are 3 types of filter you can use: file, path, and #tags (which includes tags in note properties). You can use any combination of these on a per-board basis.

You can also:

- Choose whether to use the filters as an allow or a deny list.
- Choose if you want any tags specified as a filter to be shown or hidden on cards on the board.

Filters are applied before tasks are placed onto a board:

[![filters](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/filters.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/filters.png?raw=true)

## Settings

Plugin settings are accessible from the plugin view itself, via the settings icon above the board to the left of the tabs. You can:

- Choose files and paths you do not want to load any tasks from.
- Create new boards (using the + icon next to the *Boards* heading).
- Configure your boards.
- Customize the default names of the built-in columns.
- Add/remove/edit/reorder columns.
- Delete boards.
- Choose whether to use Cardboard, Dataview or Tasks format for marking task completion.
- Choose whether to use local or UTC time when marking tasks as completed.
- Choose to not use the date of daily notes files as the due date for tasks.

The settings for your boards are saved in the

```
.obsidian/plugins/card-board/data.json
```

file inside your vault. You may see some older versions (e.g. data.0.5.0.json) in there as well. These are saved when the internal version of the settings file is updated, just in case something goes wrong! If you want to ensure you never loose your CardBoard settings then do ensure that your .obsidian directory is backed up.

## Other Plugin Compatibility

Cardboard is compatible with the *Due* and *Completion* date formats used in both [Tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/) and [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/). Due dates from both of these are understood with no configuration.

When marking a task as complete, you can choose which format to use via CardBoard's Global Settings:

[![task completion format setting panel](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/raw/main/images/taskCompletionFormatSetting.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/images/taskCompletionFormatSetting.png?raw=true)

You can also set this value to *None* if you don't want any completion date or timestamp adding to a task on completion. **This is not recommended** as if you do this, the task may well not appear at (or near) the top of any completed column you have on your board when you mark it as complete. CardBoard uses this time or date so it knows which are the most recently completed tasks so they can be shown at the top of the column.

### Dataview Plugin

```
- [ ] todo in Dataview format [due:: 2021-10-30] [completion:: 2021-10-29]
```

Will be read as a task with a due date of 30th Oct 2021 which was completed a day early.

Cardboard will honour the task related settings in Dataview, so if you set Dataview to use emoji completion or a different "completion" string (such as "done") then CardBoard will mirror this.

### Tasks Plugin

```
- [x] todo in Tasks format ðŸ“… 2021-10-30 âœ… 2025-01-13
```

Will be read as a task with a due date of 30th Oct 2021 which was completed a day early.

#### Recurring Tasks

**CardBoard does not understand recurring tasks**, even if you have set it up to use Tasks format for marking tasks as complete. Checking off a recurring task from the CardBoard board view will add the completion date in Tasks format but **will not generate a new instance of the recurring task**.

To get the correct behavior for recurring tasks, click the edit icon on the card to go to the file where the task is written, and then use the *"Tasks: Toggle Done"* command or click the checkbox from there.

## Scaling Board Text and Column Sizes

Use the following css snippet to customize these:

```
.card-board-view {
  font-size: 1em;
}

.card-board-view .card-board-column {
  width: 20em;
}
```

You can alter the general size of the contents of the cards by changng the font-size, and/or set the width of the columns by changing the width setting.

## Limitations

- Might not work that great on large vaults (as it parses all markdown files at startup). If you use folders in your vault and there are folders which you know will never contain any tasks you wish to use with CardBoard you can configure CardBoard to ignore these.
- Might not work that great on large markdown files (as it parses all markdown files, and doesn't use any form of cache). If you know any large markdown files will never contain tasks you wish to use with Cardboard, you can add them to the ignore list in settings.
- Might not be great on mobile (see previous, plus I haven't put any particular effort into making the interface mobile friendly - yet).

## Alternatives

If the way that this works isn't for for you, there are plenty of other fabulous plugins you can use for task management in Obsidian, e.g. [Checklist](https://github.com/delashum/obsidian-checklist-plugin), [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), [Reminder](https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder), [Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks), [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects), as well as the [Tasks Calendar snippet](https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar). There are others too, see the wonderful [Obsidian Plugin Stats site](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/).

## Contributing

I am working on this myself for now; it's my do-some-coding-when-I-have-some-time project so I am not accepting pull requests. However, if you want to mess around with the code then see [contributing doc](https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on getting a dev environment set up and running.
