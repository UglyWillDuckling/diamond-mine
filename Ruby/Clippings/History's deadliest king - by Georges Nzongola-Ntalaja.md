Dig into the [[Rubber Terror]], the period in which [[King Leopold II]]’s horrific regime in[[the Congo river|The Congo]] resulted in the deaths of 10 million people.  

---

  
In **1904**, [[Chief Lontulu]] laid 110 twigs in front of a foreign commission. Every twig represented a person in his village who died because of King Leopold’s brutal regime in the Congo. His testimony joined hundreds of others to help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities in human history. [[Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja]] details the horrific abuses of Leopold’s occupation and looting of the Congo.
