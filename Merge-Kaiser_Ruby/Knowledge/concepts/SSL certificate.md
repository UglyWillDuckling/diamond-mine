An SSL certificate is a **digital certificate** that
secures the connection between a user's [[web browser]] and a [[website]] by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">encrypting</mark> data and verifying the website's identity. 
It enables websites to use [[HTTPS]], which is more secure than [[HTTP]], helping to protect user data and build trust.
