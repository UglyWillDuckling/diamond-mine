description: "WANT MORE PROF. WOLFF CONTENT? Check out https://www.youtube.com/@democracyatwrkThis four part course provides a working foundation in the core concepts of Marxian economic theory -- necessary and surplus labor, labor power, surplus value, exploitation, capital accumulation, distributions of the surplus, capitalist crises, and the differences between capitalist and other class structures. In addition, these core concepts will be systematically used to understand current social problems (including political and cultural as well as economic problems). The goal is to enable students to apply Marxian economics in their own efforts to analyze society and to strategize politically today.This course was taught in the Spring of 2009 at the Brecht Forum in New York, NY.Full Video: http://blip.tv/file/2676694/Professor Wolff's RSS Feed: http://rdwolff.blip.tv/rss/flashProfessor Wolff's Website: http://rdwolff.com"
