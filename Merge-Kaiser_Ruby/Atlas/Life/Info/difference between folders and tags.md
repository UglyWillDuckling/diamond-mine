- @ a note can belong to several tags but only to 1 folder
- @ **folders** seem to represent something more **`physical`**, while **tags** look more **`abstract`**
- @ tags could be used to give different views of the same pices of information
	- for example, the same 🗒 note could look completely different when viewed under one tag and than a different tag

**Folders** represent the actual physical representation of something and are therefore limited by the same constraints. These same constraints can serve a great benefit by simplifying the structure and allowing you to organize and view notes in a natural way.

**Tags** give the ability to put notes into multiple hierarchies and therefore allow for abstraction. One note can belong to an #infinite number of [[tag]]s. This means that we can make a note that belongs to several groups at once, but, it also means that we can create something like `virtual` groups by mixing one or more tags together. An example would be a task that belongs to a health section of your vault. Taggings it with both task and health,  would give it a meaning of belonging to both the tasks and the health group, in translation, it would be a health task or a task related to health.
