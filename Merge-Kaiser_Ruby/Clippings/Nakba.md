The **Nakba** ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): النَّكْبَة, [romanized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): *an-Nakba*, [lit.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'the catastrophe') is the [Israeli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") [ethnic cleansing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing") [^16] of [Palestinian Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians "Palestinians") through their [violent displacement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion") and dispossession of land, property, and belongings, along with the destruction of their society and the suppression of their [culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Palestine "Culture of Palestine"), [identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_identity "Palestinian identity"), political rights, and [national aspirations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism "Palestinian nationalism").[^17] The term is used to describe the events of the [1948 Palestine war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war") in [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") as well as [Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") 's [ongoing persecution and displacement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_Nakba "Ongoing Nakba") of Palestinians.[^18] As a whole, it covers the fracturing of Palestinian society and the longstanding rejection of the [right of return](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return "Palestinian right of return") for [Palestinian refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees") and their descendants.[^19] [^20]

During the foundational events of the Nakba in 1948, about half of Palestine's predominantly Arab population – around 750,000 people [^21] – were expelled from their homes or made to flee through [various violent means](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_political_violence "Zionist political violence"), at first by [Zionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist "Zionist") paramilitaries, and after the establishment of the State of Israel, by [its military](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces"). [Dozens of massacres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_and_massacres_during_the_1948_Palestine_war "Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine war") targeted Palestinian Arabs, and over 500 Arab-majority towns, villages, and urban neighborhoods were [depopulated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_depopulated_during_the_1947%E2%80%931949_Palestine_war "List of towns and villages depopulated during the 1947–1949 Palestine war").[^22] Many of the settlements were either completely destroyed or repopulated by [Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") and [given new Hebrew names](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebraization_of_Palestinian_place_names "Hebraization of Palestinian place names").[^22] [^23] Israel employed [biological warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare "Biological warfare") against Palestinians by [poisoning village wells](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cast_Thy_Bread "Operation Cast Thy Bread"). By the end of the war, Israel controlled 78% of the land area of the former Mandatory Palestine.

The [Palestinian national narrative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#Palestinian_narratives "1948 Arab–Israeli War") views the Nakba as a [collective trauma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_trauma "Collective trauma") that defines Palestinians' national identity and political aspirations. The [Israeli national narrative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#Israeli_narratives "1948 Arab–Israeli War") views the Nakba as a component of the [War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war") that [established Israel's statehood and sovereignty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence").[^24] Israel negates or denies the atrocities it committed, claiming that many of the expelled Palestinians left willingly or that their expulsion was necessary and unavoidable. [Nakba denial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_denial "Nakba denial") has been increasingly challenged since the 1970s in Israeli society, particularly by the [New Historians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians "New Historians"), but the official narrative has not changed.[^24] [^25] [^26]

Palestinians observe 15 May as [Nakba Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Day "Nakba Day"), commemorating the war's events one day after [Israel's Independence Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_\(Israel\) "Independence Day (Israel)").[^27] [^28] In 1967, after the [Six-Day War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War"), [another series of Palestinian exodus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Palestinian_exodus "1967 Palestinian exodus") occurred; this came to be known as the Naksa (lit.' Setback '), and also has [its own day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naksa_Day "Naksa Day"), 5 June. The Nakba has greatly influenced Palestinian culture and is a foundational symbol of [Palestinian national identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_identity "Palestinian identity"), together with the political cartoon character [Handala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handala "Handala"), the [Palestinian *keffiyeh*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_keffiyeh "Palestinian keffiyeh"), and the [Palestinian 1948 keys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_key "Palestinian key"). Many books, songs, and poems have been written about the Nakba.[^29]

The [UN Partition Plan for Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine") in 1947

The roots of the Nakba are traced to the arrival of [Zionists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") and their [purchase of land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine "Jewish land purchase in Palestine") in [Ottoman Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine#Ottoman_period "History of Palestine") in the late 19th century.[^30] Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible.[^31] By the time the British announced their official support for Zionism in the 1917 [Balfour Declaration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration "Balfour Declaration") during [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"),[^32] Palestine's population was about 750,000, approximately 94% Arab and 6% Jewish.[^33]

After the [partition of the Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Partition of the Ottoman Empire"), British-ruled [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") began in 1922.[^34] By then, Jews had become about 10% of the population.[^35] Both the Balfour Declaration and the [Mandate for Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine "Mandate for Palestine") called the 90% Arab population "existing non-Jewish communities".[^36]

In February 1947, after [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") and [the Holocaust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust"), the British declared they would end the Mandate and submit Palestine's future to the newly created [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") for resolution.[^37] The [United Nations Special Committee on Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Committee_on_Palestine "United Nations Special Committee on Palestine") (UNSCOP) was created, and in September, it submitted a report to the [UN General Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly "UN General Assembly") recommending partition.[^38] Palestinians and most of the [Arab League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") opposed the partition.[^39] Zionists accepted it, but planned to expand Israel's borders beyond what the UN allocated to it.[^40] In the autumn of 1947, Israel and Jordan, with British approval, secretly agreed to divide the land allocated to Palestine between them after the end of the British Mandate.[^41]

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly passed Resolution 181 (II), the [United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine").[^42] At the time, Arabs made up about two-thirds of the population [^43] and owned about 90% of the land,[^44] while Jews made up between a quarter and a third of the population [^45] and owned about 7% of the land.[^46] The UN partition plan allocated to Israel about 55% of the land, where the population was about 500,000 Jews and 407,000–438,000 Arabs. Palestine was allocated the remaining 45% of the land, where the population was about 725,000–818,000 Arabs and 10,000 Jews. [Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") and [Bethlehem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem") were to be an internationally governed *[corpus separatum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_separatum_\(Jerusalem\) "Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)")* with a population of about 100,000 Arabs and 100,000 Jews.[^47]

The partition plan's detractors considered it pro-Zionist, with 56% [^48] of the land allocated to the Jewish state although the Palestinian Arab population was twice the Jewish population.[^49] The plan was celebrated by most Jews in Palestine,[^50] with Zionist leaders, in particular [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion"), viewing it as a tactical step and a stepping stone to future territorial expansion over all of Palestine.[^51] [^52] [^53] [^54] The [Arab Higher Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Higher_Committee "Arab Higher Committee"), the [Arab League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League"), and other Arab leaders and governments rejected it on the basis that the Arabs not only formed a two-thirds majority but owned a majority of the land.[^55] They also indicated unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division,[^56] arguing that it violated the principles of [national self-determination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination") in the [UN Charter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter "United Nations Charter") that grant people the right to decide their own destiny.[^57] [^58] They announced their intention to take all necessary measures to prevent the resolution's implementation.[^59] [^60] [^61] [^62]

Clickable map of [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") with the [depopulated locations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_depopulated_during_the_1947%E2%80%931949_Palestine_war "List of towns and villages depopulated during the 1947–1949 Palestine war") during the [1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight")

The central facts of what happened in the Nakba during the [1948 Palestine war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war") are well established, documented, and widely agreed upon by most Israeli, Palestinian, and other historians.[^63]

About 750,000 Palestinians – over 80% of the population living in the territory of what became the [State of Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel "State of Israel")  – [were expelled or fled from their homes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight") and became [refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees").[^21] Eleven Arab towns and cities, and [over 500 villages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_depopulated_during_the_1947%E2%80%931949_Palestine_war "List of towns and villages depopulated during the 1947–1949 Palestine war") were destroyed or depopulated.[^22] Thousands of Palestinians were killed in [dozens of massacres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_and_massacres_during_the_1948_Palestine_war "Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine war").[^64] About a dozen rapes of Palestinians by regular and irregular Israeli military forces have been documented, and more are suspected.[^65] Israelis used [psychological warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare "Psychological warfare") tactics to frighten Palestinians into flight, including targeted violence, [whispering campaigns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whispering_campaign "Whispering campaign"), radio broadcasts, and [loudspeaker vans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_truck "Sound truck").[^66] Looting by Israeli soldiers and civilians of Palestinian homes, business, farms, artwork, books, and archives was widespread.[^67]

[Small-scale local skirmishes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine") began on 30 November and gradually escalated until March 1948.[^68] When the violence started, Palestinians had already begun fleeing, expecting to return after the war.[^69] The massacre and expulsion of Palestinian Arabs and destruction of villages began in December,[^70] including massacres at [Al-Khisas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khisas_massacre "Al-Khisas massacre") (18 December 1947) [^71] and [Balad al-Shaykh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balad_al-Shaykh_massacre "Balad al-Shaykh massacre") (31 December).[^72] By March, between 70,000 and 100,000 Palestinians, mostly middle- and upper-class urban elites, were expelled or fled.[^73]

In early April 1948, the Israelis launched [Plan Dalet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Dalet "Plan Dalet"), a large-scale offensive to capture land and empty it of Palestinian Arabs.[^74] During the offensive, Israel captured and cleared land that the UN partition resolution had allocated to the Palestinians.[^75] Over 200 villages were destroyed during this period.[^76] Massacres and expulsions continued,[^77] including at [Deir Yassin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre "Deir Yassin massacre") (9 April 1948).[^78] Major Palestinian cities were depopulated, including [Tiberias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberias "Tiberias") (18 April), [Haifa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") (23 April), [Acre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel") (6–18 May), [Safed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed "Safed") (10 May), [Jaffa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa "Jaffa") (13 May), and [West Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem "West Jerusalem") 's Palestinian Arab neighborhood (24 April).[^79] Israel began engaging in [biological warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare "Biological warfare") in April and [poisoned the water supplies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_poisoning "Well poisoning") of certain towns and villages. In May, one [such operation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cast_Thy_Bread "Operation Cast Thy Bread") caused a [typhoid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever "Typhoid fever") epidemic in Acre; the Egyptians foiled another attempt in Gaza.[^80]

Under intense public anger over Palestinian losses, and seeking to take Palestinian territory for themselves to counter the Israeli-Jordanian deal, the remaining [Arab League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") states decided in late April and early May to enter the war after the British left.[^81] But the newly independent Arab League states' armies were still weak and unprepared for war,[^82] and none of the Arab League states were interested in establishing an independent Palestinian state with [Amin al-Husseini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini "Amin al-Husseini") at its head. Neither the expansionist [King Abdullah I of Jordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan "Abdullah I of Jordan") nor the British wanted the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.[^83] On 14 May, the Mandate formally ended, the last British troops left, and Israel [declared independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence").[^84] By that time, Palestinian society was destroyed and over 300,000 Palestinians had been expelled or fled.[^85]

1948 expulsion of the [Tantura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantura "Tantura") women and children to [Furaydis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furaydis "Furaydis")

On 15 May, Arab League armies entered the territory of former Mandatory Palestine, beginning the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War"), the second half of the 1948 Palestine war.[^86] Most of the violence before that had occurred in and around urban centers, in the Israeli portion of the partitioned land, while British troops were still present.[^87] After the Mandate ended, Israel seized more land allocated to the Palestinians by the UN partition plan, and expulsions, massacres, and the destruction of villages in rural areas increased.[^88] The [Tantura massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantura_massacre "Tantura massacre") was committed on 22–23 May.[^89]

The first truce between Israel and the Arab League nations was signed in early June and lasted about a month.[^90] In the summer of 1948, Israel began implementing anti-repatriation policies to prevent the [return of Palestinians to their homes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return "Palestinian right of return").[^91] A [Transfer Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_Committee "Transfer Committee") coordinated and supervised efforts to prevent Palestinian return, including the destruction of villages, resettlement of Arab villages with Jewish immigrants, confiscation of land, and dissemination of propaganda discouraging return.[^92] During the ten days of renewed fighting between Israel and the Arab states after the first truce, over 50,000 Palestinians were [expelled from Lydda and Ramle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_from_Lydda_and_Ramle "1948 Palestinian expulsion from Lydda and Ramle") (9–13 July).[^93] A second truce was signed in mid-July and lasted until October.[^90] During the two truces, Palestinians who returned to their homes or crops, called "infiltrators" by the Israelis, were killed or expelled.[^94]

Expulsions, massacres, and Israeli expansion continued in the autumn of 1948.[^95] This period saw the depopulation of [Beersheba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba "Beersheba") (21 October),[^96] the [al-Dawayima massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Dawayima_massacre "Al-Dawayima massacre") (29 October),[^97] and the [Safsaf massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safsaf_massacre "Safsaf massacre") (also 29 October).[^98] In October, Israel converted the *ad hoc* military governates ruling [Palestinian Arabs in Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel "Arab citizens of Israel") into a formal military government. The new system controlled nearly all aspects of their lives, including curfews, travel restrictions, employment and other economic restrictions, arbitrary detention and other punishments, and political control.[^99] Martial law assisted Israeli efforts to find and expel or kill "infiltrators" in order to prevent Palestinians from repopulating their villages.[^100]

Most of the fighting between Israel and the Arab states ended by the winter.[^101] On 11 December 1948, the UN passed [Resolution 194](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_194 "Resolution 194"), which declared that Palestinians should be permitted to return to their homes and be compensated for lost or damaged property. The Resolution also established the [United Nations Conciliation Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission "United Nations Conciliation Commission").[^102] Armistices formally ending the war were signed between February and July 1949,[^103] but massacres and expulsions of Palestinians continued in 1949 and beyond.[^104]

By the end of the war, Palestine was divided and Palestinians were scattered.[^105] Israel held about 78% of Palestine,[^106] including the 55% allocated to it by the UN partition plan and about half of the land allocated for a Palestinian state.[^107] The [West Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") and [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") comprised the remaining half, and were held by [Jordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank "Jordanian annexation of the West Bank") and [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_the_United_Arab_Republic "Occupation of the Gaza Strip by the United Arab Republic"), respectively.[^108] The capital that was meant to be governed internationally ([corpus separatum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_separatum_\(Jerusalem\) "Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)")) was divided between an Israeli-held [West Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem "West Jerusalem") and a Jordanian-held [East Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem "East Jerusalem").[^109] Israel, with its expanded borders, was [admitted as a member](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_273 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273") to the United Nations in May 1949.[^110] About 156,000 Palestinians remained under military rule in Israel, including many [internally displaced persons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person "Internally displaced person").[^111] The approximately 750,000 Palestinians who were expelled or fled from their homes were living in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.[^112] None were allowed to return.[^113] No Palestinian state was created.[^114]

The Nakba [continued](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_Nakba "Ongoing Nakba") after the end of the war in 1949.[^18] Israel prevented Palestinian refugees outside Israel from [returning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return "Palestinian right of return").[^115] Palestinians continued to be [expelled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949%E2%80%931956_Palestinian_expulsions "1949–1956 Palestinian expulsions"), and more Palestinian towns and villages were destroyed, with new Israeli settlements established in their place.[^116] Palestinian place names and the name "Palestine" itself were [removed from maps and books](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebraization_of_Palestinian_place_names "Hebraization of Palestinian place names").[^117]

Massacres of Palestinians also continued after the war. Sixty-nine Palestinians were killed in the 1953 [Qibya massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibya_massacre "Qibya massacre").[^118] A few years later, 49 Palestinians were killed in the [Kafr Qasim massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Qasim_massacre "Kafr Qasim massacre"), on the first day of the 1956 [Suez Crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis "Suez Crisis").[^119]

Palestinians in Israel remained under strict [martial law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law "Martial law") until 1966.[^120]

During the 1967 [Six-Day War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War"), hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees were driven from the West Bank, Gaza, and [East Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem "East Jerusalem"). Most were driven into Jordan.[^121] This has become known as *[al-Naksa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Palestinian_exodus "1967 Palestinian exodus")* (the "setback").[^122] After the war, Israel [occupied the West Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank "Israeli occupation of the West Bank") and Gaza Strip.[^123]

Some 2,000 Palestinians were killed in a massacre led by the [Lebanese Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Front "Lebanese Front") at the [Siege of Tel al-Zaatar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tel_al-Zaatar "Siege of Tel al-Zaatar") in 1976, during the [Lebanese Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War "Lebanese Civil War").[^124] Palestinian refugees in Lebanon were killed or displaced during the [1982 Lebanon War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War "1982 Lebanon War"), including between 800 and 3,500 killed in the [Sabra and Shatila massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre "Sabra and Shatila massacre").[^125]

The [First Intifada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada "First Intifada") began in 1987 and lasted until the 1993 [Oslo Accords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords").[^126] The [Second Intifada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada "Second Intifada") began in 2000.[^127] In 2005, Israel [withdrew from Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza "Israeli disengagement from Gaza") and [blockaded it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Blockade of the Gaza Strip").[^128] In the West Bank and [East Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem "East Jerusalem"), Israel built the [Israeli West Bank barrier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier "Israeli West Bank barrier") [^129] and created [Palestinian enclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves "Palestinian enclaves").[^130]

In 2011, Israel passed the [Nakba Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Law "Nakba Law"), which denies government funding to institutions that commemorate the Nakba.[^131]

The [2023 Gaza war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war") has caused the highest Palestinian casualties since the 1948 war,[^132] and has raised fear among Palestinians that history will repeat itself.[^133] This fear was exacerbated when Israeli Agricultural Minister [Avi Dichter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Dichter "Avi Dichter") said that the war would end with "Gaza Nakba 2023".[^134] Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu") rebuked Dichter.[^135]

## Components

The Nakba encompasses the violent displacement and dispossession of Palestinians, along with the destruction of their society, culture, identity, political rights, and national aspirations.[^17]

### Displacement

[Nahr al-Bared refugee camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahr_al-Bared_refugee_camp "Nahr al-Bared refugee camp") in Lebanon, 1952

During the [1947–49 Palestine war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war"), an estimated 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled, comprising around 80% of the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of what became Israel.[^21] Almost half of this figure (over 300,000 Palestinians) had fled or had been expelled ahead of the [Israeli Declaration of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence") in May 1948.[^85] This fact was named as a *[casus belli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli "Casus belli")* for the entry of the Arab League into the country, sparking the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War").[^136]

Clause 10.(b) of the [telegram](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cablegram_from_the_Secretary-General_of_the_League_of_Arab_States_to_the_Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "wikisource:Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations") from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the UN Secretary-General of 15 May 1948 justifying the intervention by the Arab States, the Secretary-General of the League alleged that "approximately over a quarter of a million of the Arab population have been compelled to leave their homes and emigrate to neighbouring Arab countries." In the period after the war, a large number of [Palestinians attempted to return to their homes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_return_to_Israel "Palestinian return to Israel"). Between 2,700 and 5,000 of them were killed by Israel, the vast majority being unarmed and intending to return for economic or social reasons.[^137]

The Nakba is described as [ethnic cleansing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing") by many scholars.[^138] They include Palestinian scholars such as [Saleh Abd al-Jawad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleh_Abd_al-Jawad "Saleh Abd al-Jawad"),[^139] [Beshara Doumani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshara_Doumani "Beshara Doumani"),[^140] [Rashid Khalidi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_Khalidi "Rashid Khalidi"),[^141] [Adel Manna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adel_Manna "Adel Manna"),[^142] [Nur Masalha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_Masalha "Nur Masalha"),[^143] [Nadim Rouhana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadim_Rouhana "Nadim Rouhana"),[^144] [Ahmad H. Sa'di](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_H._Sa%27di "Ahmad H. Sa'di"),[^145] and [Areej Sabbagh-Khoury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areej_Sabbagh-Khoury "Areej Sabbagh-Khoury"),[^146] Israeli scholars such as [Alon Confino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alon_Confino "Alon Confino"),[^147] [Amos Goldberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Goldberg "Amos Goldberg"),[^148] [Baruch Kimmerling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Kimmerling "Baruch Kimmerling"),[^149] [Ronit Lentin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronit_Lentin "Ronit Lentin"),[^150] [Ilan Pappé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9 "Ilan Pappé"),[^151] and [Yehouda Shenhav](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehouda_Shenhav "Yehouda Shenhav"),[^152] and foreign scholars such as [Abigail Bakan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Bakan "Abigail Bakan"),[^153] [Elias Khoury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Khoury "Elias Khoury"),[^154] [Mark Levene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Levene "Mark Levene"),[^155] [Derek Penslar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Penslar "Derek Penslar"),[^156] and [Patrick Wolfe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Wolfe "Patrick Wolfe"),[^157] among other scholars.[^158]

Other scholars, such as [Yoav Gelber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gelber "Yoav Gelber"),[^159] [Benny Morris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris"),[^160] and Seth J. Frantzman,[^161] disagree that the Nakba constitutes an ethnic cleansing. Morris in 2016 rejected the description of "ethnic cleansing" for 1948, while also stating that the label of "partial ethnic cleansing" for 1948 was debatable. In 2004 Morris was responding to the claim of "ethnic cleansing" occurring in 1948 by stating that, given the alternative was "genocide - the annihilation of your people," there were "circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing... It was necessary to cleanse the hinterland... \['cleanse' was\] the term they used at the time... there was no choice but to expel the Palestinian population. To uproot it in the course of war". Morris said this resulted in a "partial" expulsion of Arabs.[^162] [^163]

Still other scholars use different frameworks than "ethnic cleansing": for example, [Richard Bessel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bessel "Richard Bessel") and Claudia Haake use "forced removal" and Alon Confino uses "forced migration".[^164]

At the same time, many of those Palestinians who remained in Israel became [internally displaced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person "Internally displaced person"). In 1950, [UNRWA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA") estimated that 46,000 of the 156,000 Palestinians who remained inside the borders demarcated as Israel by the [1949 Armistice Agreements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements "1949 Armistice Agreements") were internally displaced refugees.[^165] [^166] [^167] As of 2003, some 274,000 [Arab citizens of Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel "Arab citizens of Israel") – or one in four in Israel – were [internally displaced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced "Internally displaced") from the events of 1948.[^168]

The UN Partition Plan of 1947 assigned 56% of Palestine to the future Jewish state, while the Palestinian majority (66%) were to receive 44% of the territory. 80% of the land in the to-be Jewish state was already owned by Palestinians; 11% had a Jewish title.[^169] Before, during and after the 1947–1949 war, hundreds of [Palestinian towns and villages were depopulated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depopulated_Palestinian_locations_in_Israel "Depopulated Palestinian locations in Israel") and destroyed.[^170] [^171] [Geographic names throughout the country were erased and replaced with Hebrew names](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebraization_of_Palestinian_place_names "Hebraization of Palestinian place names"), sometimes derivatives of the historical Palestinian nomenclature, and sometimes new inventions.[^172] Numerous non-Jewish historical sites were destroyed, not just during the wars, but in a subsequent process over a number of decades. For example, over 80% of Palestinian village mosques have been destroyed, and artefacts have been removed from museums and archives.[^173]

A [variety of laws were promulgated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_land_and_property_laws "Israeli land and property laws") in Israel to legalize the expropriation of Palestinian land.[^174] [^175]

The creation of Palestinian statelessness is a central component of the Nakba and continues to be a feature of Palestinian national life to the present day.[^176] All Arab Palestinians became immediately stateless as a result of the Nakba, although some took on other nationalities.[^177] After 1948, Palestinians ceased to be simply Palestinian, instead divided into [Israeli-Palestinians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel "Arab citizens of Israel"), East Jerusalem Palestinians, [UNRWA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Relief_and_Works_Agency "United Nations Relief and Works Agency") Palestinians, West Bank-Palestinians, and Gazan-Palestinians, each with different legal statuses and restrictions.[^178] In addition to these there was also the wider [Palestinian diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_diaspora "Palestinian diaspora"), who were able to achieve residency outside of [historic Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") and the refugee camps.[^179]

The first [Israeli Nationality Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_citizenship_law "Israeli citizenship law"), passed on 14 July 1952, denationalized Palestinians, rendering the former Palestinian citizenship "devoid of substance", "not satisfactory and is inappropriate to the situation following the establishment of Israel".[^180] [^181]

The Nakba was the primary cause of the [Palestinian diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_diaspora "Palestinian diaspora"). At the same time as Israel was created as a Jewish homeland, the Palestinians were turned into a "refugee nation" with a "wandering identity".[^182] Today a majority of the 13.7 million Palestinians live in the diaspora, i.e. they live outside of the historical area of [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"), primarily in other countries of the [Arab world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world").[^183] Of the 6.2 million people registered by the UN's dedicated Palestinian refugee agency, [UNRWA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA"),[^2] about 40% live in the West Bank and Gaza, and 60% in the diaspora. A large number of these diaspora refugees are not integrated into their host countries, as illustrated by the ongoing tension of [Palestinians in Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians_in_Lebanon "Palestinians in Lebanon") or the [1990–91 Palestinian exodus from Kuwait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_exodus_from_Kuwait_\(1990%E2%80%9391\) "Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (1990–91)").[^185]

These factors have resulted in a Palestinian identity of "suffering", whilst the [deterritorialization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterritorialization "Deterritorialization") of the Palestinians has created a uniting factor and focal point in the desire to return to their lost homeland.[^186]

The most important long-term implications of the Nakba for the Palestinian people were the loss of their homeland, the fragmentation and marginalization of their national community, and their transformation into a [stateless people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness "Statelessness").[^187]

Since the late 1990s, the phrase " [ongoing Nakba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_Nakba "Ongoing Nakba") " ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): النکبة المستمرة, [romanized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): *al-nakba al-mustamirra*) has emerged to describe the "continuous experience of violence and dispossession" experienced by the Palestinian people.[^188] This term enjoins the understanding of the Nakba not as an event in 1948, but as an ongoing process that continues through to the present day.[^189]

On November 11, 2023, Israeli [Agriculture Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Agriculture_and_Rural_Development_\(Israel\) "Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Israel)") [Avi Dichter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Dichter "Avi Dichter") remarked in an interview on [N12 News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hevrat_HaHadashot "Hevrat HaHadashot") on the nature of the [Gaza war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war") that "From an operational standpoint, you cannot wage a war like the IDF wants to in Gaza while the masses are between the tanks and the soldiers," he said. "It's the 2023 Gaza Nakba." [^190]

## Terminology

The term Nakba was first applied to the events of 1948 by [Constantin Zureiq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Zureiq "Constantin Zureiq"), a professor of history at the [American University of Beirut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University_of_Beirut "American University of Beirut"), in his 1948 book *[Ma'na an-Nakba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27na_an-Nakba "Ma'na an-Nakba")* (*The Meaning of the Disaster*).[^191] Zureiq wrote that "the tragic aspect of the Nakba is related to the fact that it is not a regular misfortune or a temporal evil, but a Disaster in the very essence of the word, one of the most difficult that Arabs have ever known over their long history." [^192] Prior to 1948, the "Year of the Catastrophe" among [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") referred to 1920, when European colonial powers [partitioned the Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Partition of the Ottoman Empire") into a series of separate states along lines of their own choosing.[^193]

The word was used again one year later by the Palestinian poet [Burhan al-Deen al-Abushi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burhan_al-Deen_al-Abushi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Burhan al-Deen al-Abushi (page does not exist)").[^192] Zureiq's students subsequently founded the [Arab Nationalist Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Nationalist_Movement "Arab Nationalist Movement") group in 1952, one of the first post-Nakba Palestinian political movements. In a six-volume encyclopedia *Al-Nakba: Nakbat Bayt al-Maqdis Wal-Firdaws al-Mafqud* (*The Catastrophe: The Catastrophe of Jerusalem and the Lost Paradise*) published between 1958 and 1960,[^194] [Aref al-Aref](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aref_al-Aref "Aref al-Aref") wrote: "How can I call it but *Nakba* \["catastrophe"\]? When we the Arab people generally and the Palestinians particularly, faced such a disaster (Nakba) that we never faced like it along the centuries, our homeland was sealed, we \[were\] expelled from our country, and we lost many of our beloved sons." [^195] [Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Nimr_al-Hawari "Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari") also used the term Nakba in the title of his book *Sir al Nakba* (*The Secret behind the Disaster*) written in 1955.[^196]

The use of the term has evolved over time.[^196] Initially, the use of the term Nakba among Palestinians was not universal. For example, for many years after 1948, [Palestinian refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees") in [Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon") avoided and even actively resisted using the term, because it lent permanency to a situation they viewed as temporary, and they often insisted on being called "returnees".[^197] In the 1950s and 1960s, terms they used to describe the events of 1948 included *al-'ightiṣāb* ("the rape"), or were more euphemistic, such as *al-'aḥdāth* ("the events"), *al-hijra* ("the exodus"), and *lammā sharnā wa-tla'nā* ("when we blackened our faces and left").[^197] Nakba narratives were avoided by the leadership of the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") (PLO) in Lebanon in the 1970s, in favor of a narrative of revolution and renewal.[^197] Interest in the Nakba by organizations representing refugees in Lebanon surged in the 1990s due to the perception that the refugees' [right of return](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_return "Right of return") might be negotiated away in exchange for Palestinian statehood, and the desire was to send a clear message to the international community that this right was non-negotiable.[^197]

While Palestinians and [Israeli Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Arabs "Israeli Arabs") mourn the 1948 war as the Nakba (left, Israeli Arabs' annual [March of Return](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Return_\(Israel\) "March of Return (Israel)")), most [Israeli Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews "Israeli Jews") celebrate it as their war of independence (right).

The Palestinian national narrative regards the repercussions of the Nakba as a formative trauma defining its national, political and moral aspirations and its identity. The Palestinian people developed a victimized national identity in which they had lost their country as a result of the 1948 war. From the Palestinian perspective, they have been forced to pay for the Holocaust perpetrated in Europe with their freedom, properties and bodies instead of those who were truly responsible.[^25]

[Shmuel Trigano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Trigano "Shmuel Trigano"), writing in the *Jewish Political Studies Review*, outlines the evolution of the Nakba narrative through three stages. Initially, it depicted Palestinians as victims displaced by Israel's creation to make way for Jewish immigrants. The next phase recast the [Six-Day War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War") as Israel's colonization of Palestinian lands, aligning the Palestinian cause with anti-colonial sentiments. The final stage leverages Holocaust memories, accusing Israel of [apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid"), resonating with Western guilt over the Holocaust. He argues these evolving interpretations omit complex historical factors involving failed attempts to eliminate Israel, contested territorial claims, and [Jewish refugee displacement from Arab nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world "Jewish exodus from the Muslim world").[^198]

The Israeli national narrative rejects the Palestinian characterization of 1948 as the Nakba (catastrophe), instead viewing it as the War of Independence that [established Israel's statehood and sovereignty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence").[^24] [^25] It portrays the events of 1948 as the culmination of the [Zionist movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") and [Jewish national aspirations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_for_the_Jewish_people "Homeland for the Jewish people"), resulting in military success against invading Arab armies, armistice agreements, and recognition of Israel's legitimacy by the United Nations.[^24] While acknowledging some instances of Israeli responsibility for the Palestinian refugee crisis, as documented by historians like Benny Morris, the overarching Israeli narrative accommodates this within the context of Israel's emergence as a state under difficult war conditions, without negating Israel's foundational story and identity.[^24] It perceives the 1948 war and its outcome as an equally formative and fundamental event – as an act of justice and redemption for the Jewish people after centuries of historical suffering, and the key step in the " [negation of the Diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_of_the_Diaspora "Negation of the Diaspora") ".[^25]

According to this narrative, the Palestinian Arabs voluntarily fled their homes during the war, encouraged by Arab leaders who told Palestinians to temporarily evacuate so that Arab armies [could destroy Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calls_for_the_destruction_of_Israel "Calls for the destruction of Israel"), and then upon losing the war, refused to integrate them.[^199] This viewpoint also contrasts [Jewish refugees absorbed by Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world#Absorption "Jewish exodus from the Muslim world") with [Palestinian refugees kept stateless by Arab countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees#Arab_states "Palestinian refugees") as political pawns. In contrast to the Palestinian narrative, claims that Arab villages were depopulated and that Palestinian homes were destroyed are not acknowledged by the mainstream Israeli narrative, typically using terminology such as "abandoned" property and "population exchange" rather than "confiscated" or "expelled".[^199] [^24]

Israeli officials have repeatedly described the term as embodying an "Arab lie" or as a justification for terrorism. In 2009, the [Israeli Education Ministry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_\(Israel\) "Ministry of Education (Israel)") banned using the term "nakba" in textbooks for Arab children.[^200]

In May 2009, [Yisrael Beiteinu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisrael_Beiteinu "Yisrael Beiteinu") introduced a bill that would outlaw all Nakba commemorations, with a three-year prison sentence for such acts of remembrance.[^201] Following public criticism, the bill draft was changed, the prison sentence dropped and instead the [Minister of Finance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_\(Israel\) "Ministry of Finance (Israel)") would have the authority to reduce state funding for Israeli institutions found to be "commemorating Independence Day or the day of the establishment of the state as a day of mourning".[^202] The new draft was approved by the Knesset in March 2011, and became known as the [Nakba Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Law "Nakba Law").[^203] [^204] [^205] In 2011, the [Knesset](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset "Knesset") passed the [Nakba Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Law "Nakba Law"), forbidding institutions from commemorating the event. According to [Neve Gordon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neve_Gordon "Neve Gordon"), a school ceremony memoralizing the Nakba would, under the 2011 law, have to respond to charges that it incited racism, violence and terrorism, and denied Israel's democratic character, in doing so.[^206] In 2023, after the United Nations instituted a commemoration day for the Nakba on 15 May, the Israeli ambassador [Gilad Erdan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Erdan "Gilad Erdan") remonstrated that the event itself was [antisemitic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism").[^207] The implementation of the new law unintentionally promoted knowledge of the Nakba within Israeli society.[^208]

The denial of the Nakba is central to Zionist narratives of 1948.[^209] The term "Nakba denial" was used in 1998 by Steve Niva, editor of the *[Middle East Report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Report "Middle East Report")*, in describing how the rise of the early Internet led to competing online narratives of the events of 1948.[^210] In the 21st century the term came to be used by activists and scholars to describe narratives that minimized elements of the expulsion and its aftermath,[^209] particularly in Israeli and Western historiography before the late 1980s,[^211] when Israel's history began to be reviewed and rewritten by the [New Historians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians "New Historians").[^212] [^213]

Nakba denial has been described as still prevalent in both Israeli and American discourse and linked to various tropes associated with [anti-Arab racism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Arab_racism "Anti-Arab racism").[^214] The 2011 ' [Nakba Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Law "Nakba Law") ' authorized the withdrawal of state funds from organizations that commemorate the day on which the Israeli state was established as a day of mourning, or that deny the existence of Israel as a "Jewish and democratic state." [^203] Israeli [grassroots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots "Grassroots") movements, such as [Zochrot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zochrot "Zochrot"), aim to commemorate the Nakba through public memorials and events.[^203] In May 2023, following the 75th anniversary of the Nakba, Palestinian president [Mahmoud Abbas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas "Mahmoud Abbas") made the denial of the 1948 expulsion a crime punishable by two years in jail.[^215]

On 17 May 2024, the [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") commemorated the Palestinian Nakba for a second year, calling on the international community to redouble its efforts to end the Israeli occupation. An event, "1948-2024: The Continuing Palestinian Nakba" was also held.[^216]

## Historiography

[Avraham Sela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Sela "Avraham Sela") and Alon Kadish claim that the Palestinian [national memory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_memory "National memory") of the Nakba has evolved over time, reconstructing the events of 1948 to serve contemporary Palestinian national demands. They argue that the Palestinian historiography of the Nakba tends to "entirely ignore" the attacks launched by Arab [irregular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Holy_War "Army of the Holy War") and [volunteer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Liberation_Army "Arab Liberation Army") forces against the [Yishuv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv"), downplaying the role of [Palestinian leaders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Higher_Committee "Arab Higher Committee") in the events leading to the 1948 war and defeat.[^217]

Elias Khoury writes that the works of [Edward Said](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said "Edward Said") were important for taking a "radically new approach" to the Nakba than those of Zureiq and other early adopters of the term, whose usage had "the connotation of a natural catastrophe" and thus freed "Palestinian leadership and Arab governments from direct responsibility for the defeat." [^218]

[*Farha*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farha_\(film\) "Farha (film)"), a film about the Nakba directed by Jordanian director [Darin J. Sallam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darin_J._Sallam "Darin J. Sallam"), was chosen as Jordan's official submission for the [2023 Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Academy_Awards "2023 Academy Awards") International Feature Film category. In response, [Avigdor Lieberman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Lieberman "Avigdor Lieberman"), the Israeli Finance Minister, ordered the treasury to withdraw government funding for Jaffa's [Al Saraya Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arab-Hebrew_Theater "The Arab-Hebrew Theater"), where the film was scheduled for projection.[^219]

## Museums

The [Al Qarara Cultural Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qarara_Cultural_Museum "Al Qarara Cultural Museum") held a collection of pre-Nakba jewellery. It was destroyed in an explosion as a result of an [Israeli attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war") in October 2023.[^220] [^221]

The ethnic cleansing continues in the present day by other means: the silent transfer in Jerusalem; the settlements and the expropriation of land in the West Bank; the communal settlements in the Galilee for Jews only; the new Citizenship decree (which bans Palestinian citizens from bringing their Palestinian spouses into Israel, thanks to the emergency laws); the "unrecognized Palestinian villages" constantly under the threat of destruction; the incessant demolition of Bedouin houses in the south; the omission of Arabic on road signs; the prohibition on importing literature from Arab countries, and many others.

This proves the error of some Arab historians who considered the Nakba a historic event whose place is set firmly in the past. The everyday reality of life in Palestine clearly indicates that the 1948 war was merely the beginning of the catastrophic event. It did not end when the cease-fire agreements of 1949 were signed. In fact, 1948 was the beginning of a phenomenon that continues to this day... \[p. xiv\] The Nakba continues to this day even for those Israeli Palestinians who were denied their label of national identity as "Palestinians" and are now referred to as "Israeli Arabs."... While the continuing Nakba is obscured from view in Israel by the laws and legislation approved by the Israeli parliament, the Nakba is very conspicuous in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. Those lands occupied in 1967 are subject to military laws, while settlements proliferate in every corner: from Jerusalem, which is being suffocated by Jewish settlements, to the West Bank, through to the Jordan Valley. Repression, administrative detentions, and outright killing have become daily institutionalized practices. Israel, in fact, has built a comprehensive apartheid system shored up by settler-only roads that circumvent Palestinian cities, the wall of separation that tears up and confiscates Palestinian cities and villages, and the many checkpoints that have made moving from one Palestinian Bantustan to the next a daily ordeal. The consequences of the continuing Nakba are nowhere clearer than in Jerusalem and Hebron, where settlers plant their communities among Palestinians, closing roads and turning ordinary chores into a daily nightmare. They reach the peak of inhumanity by transforming Gaza into the biggest open-air prison in the world.";[Rouhana & Sabbagh-Khoury 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFRouhanaSabbagh-Khoury2017), pp. 393 ("We use "Nakba" to refer to an event and a process.

For Palestinians, mourning sixty-three years of al-Nakba is not just about remembering the 'ethnic cleansing' of 1948, it is also about marking the ongoing dispossession and dislocation. Today the trauma of the Nakba continues: the ongoing forced displacement of Palestinians caused by Israeli colonisation of the West Bank, land confiscation, continued closures and invasions, de facto annexation facilitated by Israel's 730-kilometre 'apartheid wall' in the occupied West Bank, and the ongoing horrific siege of Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem are denied access to land, water and other basic resources. Today the Nakba continues through the 'politics of denial'. There are millions of Palestinian refugees around the world, all of whom are denied their internationally recognised 'right of return' to their homes and land. The memory, history, rights and needs of Palestinian refugees have been excluded not only from recent Middle East peacemaking efforts but also from Palestinian top-down and elite approaches to the refugee issue (Boqai' and Rempel 2003). The ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Naqab, and the failure of both the Israeli state and the international community to acknowledge 1948 as such, continue to underpin the Palestine–Israel conflict...");[Lentin 2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFLentin2010), p. 111, "Non-Zionist scholars operate a different timescale and highlight the continuities between wartime policies and post-1948 ethnic cleansing. They treat the Nakba as the beginning of an ongoing policy of expulsion and expropriation, rather than a fait accompli which ended a long time ago.";[Abu-Lughod & Sa'di 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFAbu-LughodSa'di2007), pp. 10 ("For Palestinians, still living their dispossession, still struggling or hoping for return, many under military occupation, many still immersed in matters of survival, the past is neither distant nor over... the Nakba is not over yet; after almost sixty years neither the Palestinians nor Israelis have yet achieved a state of normality; the violence and uprooting of Palestinians continues.") and 18-19 ("One of the most important is that the past represented by the cataclysmic Nakba is not past. What happened in 1948 is not over, either because Palestinians are still living the consequences or because similar processes are at work in the present.... Their dispersion has continued, their status remains unresolved, and their conditions, especially in the refugee camps, can be miserable. For those with the class backgrounds or good fortune to have rebuilt decent lives elsewhere, whether in the United States, Kuwait, or Lebanon, the pain may be blunted. But for those in the vicinity of Israel, the assaults by the Zionist forces that culminated in the expulsions of the Nakba have not actually ceased. The Palestinians who remained within the borders of the new state were subjected to military rule for the first twenty years. Then in 1967, with the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, there was another dislocating assault. In 1982 Israel bombarded and invaded Lebanon, causing mass destruction, the routing of the PLO, and then a massacre in the refugee camps. With Palestinian resistance in the occupied territories (the two intifadas), the violence escalated. Hardly a week goes by now when Palestinians are not shelled, shot, "assassinated," arrested, taken to prison, or tortured. Not a day goes by when they are not humiliated at checkpoints or prevented from moving about by the Israeli army. The confrontation continues and with it the funerals, the house demolitions, the deportations, and the exodus. The usurping of water, the confiscation of land, the denial of legal rights, and the harassment also continue.");[Jayyusi 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFJayyusi2007), pp. 109-110 ("The unfolding trajectory of continuous dispossession and upheaval experienced at the hands of the Israeli state was to reshape the space of the collective narrative over time. It was to become obvious that the Nakba was not the last collective site of trauma, but what came later to be seen, through the prism of repeated dispossessions and upheavals, as the foundational station in an unfolding and continuing saga of dispossession, negations, and erasure.") and 114-116

For the Palestinian, it is not merely a political event – the establishment of the state of Israel on 78 percent of the territory of the Palestine Mandate, or even, primarily a humanitarian one – the creation of the modern world's most enduring refugee problem. The nakba is of existential significance to Palestinians, representing both the shattering of the Palestinian community in Palestine and the consolidation of a shared national consciousness."; [Abu-Lughod & Sa'di 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFAbu-LughodSa'di2007), p. 3: "For Palestinians, the 1948 War led indeed to a "catastrophe." A society disintegrated, a people dispersed, and a complex and historically changing but taken for granted communal life was ended violently. The Nakba has thus become, both in Palestinian memory and history, the demarcation line between two qualitatively opposing periods. After 1948, the lives of the Palestinians at the individual, community, and national level were dramatically and irreversibly changed."

Retrieved 14 November 2023. The Palestinians regard the Nakba and its repercussions as a formative trauma defining their identity and their national, moral, and political aspirations. As a result of the 1948 war, the Palestinian people, which to a large degree lost their country to the establishment of a Jewish state for the survivors of the Holocaust, developed a victimized national identity. From their perspective, the Palestinians have been forced to pay for the Jewish Holocaust with their bodies, their property, and their freedom instead of those who were truly responsible. Jewish Israelis, in contrast, see the war and its outcome not merely as an act of historical justice that changed the historical course of the Jewish people, which until that point had been filled with suffering and hardship, but also as a birth – the birth of Israel as an independent Jewish state after two thousand years of exile. As such, it must be pure and untainted, because if a person, a nation, or a state is born in sin, its entire essence is tainted. In this sense, discourse on the war is not at all historical but rather current and extremely sensitive. Its power and intensity is directly influenced by present day events. In the Israeli and the Palestinian cases, therefore, the 1948 war plays a pivotal role in two simple, clear, unequivocal, and harmonious narratives, with both peoples continuing to see the war as a formative event in their respective histories.

This was agreed in principle in two secret meetings in August 1946 in Transjordan between ʻAbdullah and Jewish Agency emissary Eliahu (Elias) Sasson. (Incidentally, ʻAbdullah and his prime minister, Ibrahim Hashim, believed – as had the Peel Commission – that such a partition, in order to be viable and lasting, should be accompanied by a transfer of the Arab inhabitants out of the area of the Jewish state–to-be.) There matters stood until UNSCOP proposed partition – but between Palestine's Arabs and Palestine's Jews – as the preferred solution. Neither ʻAbdullah nor the Jewish Agency wanted a Husseini-led Palestinian Arab state as their neighbor; both preferred an alternative partition, between themselves. On 17 November 1947, twelve days before the passage of the partition resolution, Golda Myerson (Meir), acting head of the Jewish Agency Political Department, secretly met ʻAbdullah at Naharayim (Jisr al-Majami), to reaffirm the agreement in principle of August 1946. ʻAbdullah at first vaguely reiterated his preference for incorporating all of Palestine in his kingdom, with the Jews enjoying autonomy. Meir countered that the Jews wanted peaceful partition between two sovereign "states." The Jews would accept a Jordanian takeover of the West Bank as a fait accompli and would not oppose it – though, formally, the Jewish Agency remained bound by the prospective UN decision to establish two states. ʻAbdullah said that he, too, wanted a compromise, not war. In effect, ʻAbdullah agreed to the establishment of a Jewish state in part of Palestine and Meir agreed to a Jordanian takeover of the West Bank (albeit while formally adhering to whatever partition resolution the General Assembly would adopt). Both sides agreed not to attack each other. The subject of Jerusalem was not discussed or resolved... \[p. 193\] Thus it was that when Golda Meir, disguised in an Arab robe, arrived on the night of 10–11 May in Amman for her second secret meeting with ʻAbdullah, the previous months' understanding about a peaceful Jewish-Hashemite partition was not reaffirmed... There was a green light. Jordan had won British consent to occupy of the West Bank with the termination of the Mandate – so ʻAbdullah, Abul Huda, and Glubb believed – and nothing the British did or said thereafter was to contradict this impression... \[p. 194\] But ʻAbdullah's bellicose tone and Meir's gloomy report notwithstanding, the king had decided – as became clear from the Legion's subsequent actions – to move into Arab Palestine while trying to avoid war with the Yishuv and refraining from attacking the territory of the UN-defined Jewish state.";[Sa'di 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFSa'di2007), p. 291, "Not content with the 56 percent of the country offered to them by the un plan, the Zionists colluded with ʻAbdallah, the Emir of Trans-Jordan, to partition the remaining 43 percent proposed for a Palestinian Arab State (Shlaim 1988; 2001; Rogan 2001) and ended up with more than three quarters of the country.

The Arabs' list of arguments against the majority's conclusions was indeed a long one. A Palestinian historian summarized it by saying 'Everything about it was Zionist'. When one takes into consideration the majority's recommendations and the enthusiasm with which these recommendations were accepted by the Zionist leadership, then one can indeed affirm that claim. UNSCOP recommended an independent Jewish state, although the Arabs firmly objected to the principle of independence for the Jews, and did so in a way very generous to the Jews. More than half of the area of Palestine (62 percent) was allocated to be a Jewish state and the Arab state was supposed to make do with the remaining area, although the Palestinian Arab population numbered as much as twice the Jewish population in the land. The pro-Zionist results from UNSCOP confirmed the Arabs' basic suspicions towards the committee. Even before the onset of its inquiry in Palestine, argued the Arabs, most of its members took a pro-Zionist stand. In addition, according to the Arabs, the committee's final object – the partition – was pre-decided by the Americans. According to this opinion, the outcome of the UNSCOP inquiry was a foregone conclusion. This perception, which led the Palestinian Arabs to boycott the committee, is shared by some modern studies as well."

Many big cafes in Tel Aviv served free champagne. A brewery threw open its doors to the crowd. Jews jeered some British troops who were patrolling Tel Aviv streets but others handed them wine. In Jerusalem crowds mobbed armoured cars and drove through the streets on them.

Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were 'bad from a military and political point of view,' Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, 'not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements'. The idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance, 'I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.

Palumbo notes that "\[t\]he Zionists accepted this scheme \[the UN partition plan\] since they hoped to use their state as a base to conquer the whole country." Similarly, Flapan states that "\[Zionist\] acceptance of the resolution in no way diminished the belief of all the Zionist parties in their right to the whole of the country \[Palestine\]"; and that "acceptance of the UN Partition Resolution was an example of Zionist pragmatism par excellence. It was a tactical acceptance, a vital step in the right direction – a springboard for expansion when circumstances proved more judicious."

By the end of March 1948 most of the wealthy and middle-class families had fled Jaffa, Haifa, and Jerusalem, and most Arab rural communities had evacuated the heavily Jewish Coastal Plain; a few had also left the Upper Jordan Valley. Most were propelled by fear of being caught up, and harmed, in the fighting; some may have feared life under Jewish rule. It is probable that most thought of a short, temporary displacement with a return within weeks or months, on the coattails of victorious Arab armies or international diktats.

At that time, that 'capacity' meant chemical and biological weapons... These were ultimate weapons that could be used either for offense or defense (and the context of the immediate military operations, as well as those that had preceded it, would be the critical factors in that categorization).";[Cohen 2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFCohen2001), p. 31, "It is believed that one of the largest operations in this campaign was in the Arab coastal town of Acre, north of Haifa, shortly before it was conquered by the IDF on May 17, 1948. According to Milstein, the typhoid epidemic that spread in Acre in the days before the town fell to the Israeli forces was not the result of wartime chaos but rather a deliberate covert action by the IDF – the contamination of Acre's water supply... The success of the Acre operation may have persuaded Israeli decisionmakers to continue with these activities. On May 23, 1948, Egyptian soldiers in the Gaza area caught four Israeli soldiers disguised as Arabs near water wells... It seems that many people knew something about these operations, but both the participants and later historians chose to avoid the issue, which gradually became a national taboo... Despite the official silence, it appears there is little doubt now about the mission of the failed Gaza operation."

Thus, in the days before and after 15 May the war plan had changed in essence from a united effort to conquer large parts of the nascent Jewish state, and perhaps destroy it, into an uncoordinated, multilateral land grab. As a collective, the Arab states still wished and hoped to destroy Israel – and, had their armies encountered no serious resistance, would, without doubt, have proceeded to take all of Palestine, including Tel Aviv and Haifa.

And some Arab leaders spoke of driving the Jews into the sea and ridding Palestine "of the Zionist plague." The struggle, as the Arabs saw it, was about the fate of Palestine/the Land of Israel, all of it, not over this or that part of the country. But, in public, official Arab spokesmen often said that the aim of the May 1948 invasion was to "save" Palestine or "save the Palestinians," definitions more agreeable to Western ears. The picture of Arab aims was always more complex than Zionist historiography subsequently made out. The chief cause of this complexity was that fly-in-the-ointment, King ʻAbdullah. Jordan's ruler, a pragmatist, was generally skeptical of the Arabs' ability to defeat, let alone destroy, the Yishuv, and fashioned his war aim accordingly: to seize the Arab-populated West Bank, preferably including East Jerusalem... \[p. 397\] Other Arab leaders were generally more optimistic. But they, too, had ulterior motives, beyond driving the Jews into the sea or, at the least, aborting the Jewish state. Chief among them was to prevent their fellow leaders (especially ʻAbdullah) from conquering and annexing all or too much of Palestine and to seize as much of Palestine as they could for themselves.";[Sa'di 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFSa'di2007), pp. 293–294, "It was not until May 15, a month and a half after the implementation of Plan D, that neighboring Arab states sent in armed forces in an attempt to halt the Zionist seizure of territory and the ethnic cleansing of the population... The physical and psychological condition of the refugees as well as the horror stories they carried intensified the pressures on Arab leaders to commit their regular armies to the battle... Their intervention came too late, when their ability to tip the balance of power had already been lost. The Zionist forces were able to repel the attacks of the Arab armies, to pursue the campaign of conquest, and to continue expelling Palestinians and destroying their villages... Moreover, because of political rivalries between Arab leaders, there was a failure to coordinate operations (Flapan 1987; Gerges 2001: 151–158; Shlaim 2001)."

All the leaders loathed Husseini; all, to one degree or another, cared little about Palestinian goals, their rhetoric notwithstanding. It was with this in mind that Jordan, on the eve of the invasion, ordered the ALA out of the West Bank and subsequently disarmed the local Arab militias. The Arab states' marginalization of the Palestinian Arabs was in some measure a consequence of their military defeats of April and the first half of May.

But the Zionist leaders had decided against this. By late summer 1948 a consensus had formed that the refugees were not to be allowed back during the war, and a majority – led by Ben-Gurion and Shertok – believed that it was best that they not return after the war either. The Israelis argued that a discussion of refugee repatriation must await the end of hostilities: in wartime, returnees would constitute a fifth column. But, in private, they added that after the war, too, if allowed back, returnees would constitute a demographic and political time bomb, with the potential to destabilize the Jewish state... The Israeli decision to bar a refugee return had consolidated between April and August.";[Pappe 2006](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFPappe2006), pp. 187–190, "\[p. 187\] The major activities towards the end of the 1948 ethnic cleansing operation now focused on implementing Israel's anti-repatriation policy on two levels. The first level was national, introduced in August 1948 by an Israeli governmental decision to destroy all the evicted villages and transform them into new Jewish settlements or 'natural' forests. The second level was diplomatic, whereby strenuous efforts were made to avert the growing international pressure on Israel to allow the return of the refugees. The two were closely interconnected: the pace of demolition was deliberately accelerated with the specific aim of invalidating any discussion on the subject of refugees returning to their houses, since those houses would no longer be there... There was a third anti-repatriation effort, and that was to control the demographic distribution of Palestinians both within the villages that had not been cleansed and in the previously mixed towns of Palestine, at that point already totally'de-Arabised'. For this purpose, the Israeli army established, on 12 January 1949, a new unit, the Minority Unit. It was made up of Druze, Circassians and Bedouin who were recruited to it for one specific job only: to prevent Palestinian villagers and town dwellers from returning to their original homes.";[Morris 2004](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFMorris2004), p. 589, "But if a measure of ambivalence and confusion attended Haganah\\IDF treatment of Arab communities during and immediately after conquest, there was nothing ambiguous about Israeli policy, from summer 1948, toward those who had been displaced and had become refugees and toward those who were yet to be displaced, in future operations: Generally applied with resolution and, often, with brutality, the policy was to prevent a refugee return at all costs. And if, somehow, refugees succeeded in infiltrating back, they were routinely rounded up and expelled (though tens of thousands of 'infiltrators' ultimately succeeded in resettling and becoming Israeli citizens). In this sense, it may fairly be said that all 700,000 or so who ended up as refugees were compulsorily displaced or 'expelled'."

The name 'Palestine' disappeared from the map. To complete this transformation of the country, in August 1948 a de facto 'Transfer Committee' was officially (though secretly) appointed by the Israeli cabinet to plan the Palestinian refugees' organised resettlement in the Arab states. The three-member committee was composed of 'Ezra Danin, a former senior Haganah intelligence officer and a senior Foreign Ministry adviser on Arab affairs since July 1948; Zalman Lifschitz, the prime minister's adviser on land matters; and Yosef Weitz (born in Russia in 1890, emigrated to Palestine in 1908), head of the Jewish National Fund's land settlement department, as head of the Committee. The main Israeli propaganda lines regarding the Palestinian refugees and some of the myths of 1948 were cooked up by members of this official Transfer Committee. Besides doing everything possible to reduce the Palestinian population in Israel, Weitz and his colleagues sought in October 1948 to amplify and consolidate the demographic transformation of Palestine by: preventing Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes and villages; destroying Arab villages; settling Jews in Arab villages and towns and distributing Arab lands among Jewish settlements; extricating Jews from Iraq and Syria; seeking ways to ensure the absorption of Palestinian refugees in Arab countries and launching a propaganda campaign to discourage Arab return.";[Morris 2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFMorris2008), pp. 300 and 308;[Pappe 2006](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFPappe2006), p. 212, "Thus he decided to appoint Danin and Weitz to a committee of two that from then on would take all final decisions on Palestinian property and land, the main features of which were destruction and confiscation.";[Morris 2004](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFMorris2004), pp. 312–329, "\[p. 312\] From May, Weitz pressed Ben-Gurion and Shertok to set up a 'Transfer Committee', preferably with himself at its head, to oversee 'transfer policy', which in the main was to focus on measures that would assure that there would be no return. More guardedly, the committee was also to advise the political leadership and the Haganah on further population displacements. The first unofficial Transfer Committee – composed of Weitz, Danin and Sasson, now head of the Middle East Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry – came into being at the end of May, following Danin's agreement to join and Shertok's 28 May unofficial sanction of the committee's existence and goals... \[p. 313\] from the beginning of June, with JNF funds and personnel, the committee set about razing villages in various areas... \[p. 329\] Although no formal decision was reached, a committee – the second and official Transfer Committee – with far narrower terms of reference than Weitz had originally sought, was at last appointed by Ben-Gurion. The 18 August gathering at the Prime Minister's Office had been defined as 'consultative'. The participants had been united on the need to bar a return and there was general, if not complete, agreement as to the means to be used to attain this end – destruction of villages, settlement in other sites and on abandoned lands, cultivation of Arab fields, purchase and expropriation of Arab lands, and the use of propaganda to persuade the refugees that they would not be allowed back. The same day, orders went out to all IDF units to prevent 'with all means' the return of refugees.";[Schulz 2003](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFSchulz2003), pp. 33–34, "Initially a number of measures were taken in order to prevent refugees from returning. At the end of May a Transfer Committee was set up, proposing that return be barred and that the Arab Palestinian population be assisted in being absorbed elsewhere. In this plan, villages were to be destroyed during military operations, cultivation was to be hindered and Jews were to be settled in towns and villages (Morris 1987:136). The plan became official policy during the latter part of the war... In June the Israeli government decided officially to bar a return, in order to maintain what had, from a Zionist perspective, been achieved. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) had received an order to halt any movement of refugees back to Israel by the use of fire."

The military government resorted to the 1945 defense (emergency) regulations to legitimize the policy of repression, theft, and the expulsion of thousands of those who remained in the Galilee and elsewhere. The government's policy made Arab residents accused of being perpetual violators of those unjust laws. The imposition of permanent curfews at night, limiting the mobility of citizens, and the system of permits which were granted to those with close connections and denied to the rest, deprived people of a dignified life and basic rights. Even within Arab towns and villages the army declared large tracts of land "military zones" which the owners of the land were prohibited from entering or cultivating. In this way the system of military rule strangled the economy of Arab citizens and prohibited the development of their towns and villages so as to make it easier to control them.

The legal status of the military rule that was imposed on the Palestinian minority in October 1948 was grounded in the mandatory emergency regulations the British had issued in 1945 against the Jewish underground, which gave military governors extended authority over the people under their rule. These same regulations now became a pernicious tool in the hands of callous and sometimes sadistic military rulers, who generally were drawn from non-combatant units just before their retirement. Their cruel behaviour consisted mainly of harassing the population with a range of abuses, not unlike those to which new army recruits were subjected. There were other aspects to Israeli military rule. Under its umbrella, the official land confiscation policy was able to continue in the name of 'security' and 'public interest'. Political activists even vaguely suspected of identifying with Palestinian nationalism were expelled or imprisoned.";[Khalidi 2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFKhalidi2020), p. 83, "Until 1966, most Palestinians lived under strict martial law and much of their land was seized (along with that of those who had been forced from the country and were now refugees).";[Bäuml 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFB%C3%A4uml2017), pp. 103–124, "\[p. 103\] The military rule was forced upon the Arabs through a special military unit called "the military government," which was the main Israeli official mechanism governing the Arabs remaining in Israel. As the Arabs within the state of Israel had become a minority and were no longer a threat to the Zionists, the overall aim of the military government was to secure the continued traditional segregation and exclusion of Arabs from the Zionist project, which started with the beginning of Zionism. This included expropriation of large areas of Arab land that had been given over to Jewish settlement, as well as the Arabs being defined as security threats that had to be withstood... \[p. 108\] Thus, during the 1948 war, the Temporary State Council decided to place the Galilee, the Triangle area, the Naqab and the cities of Ramleh, Lydda, Jaffa, and Majdal Asqalan – areas with an Arab majority population at the end of the battles – under special military rule. From that time until the end of this rule in 1968, the military government was the central Israeli official body administering the affairs of the Arab minority in Israel... The aim of the military government's actions was to minimize and almost abolish the civil equality that the Arabs should have enjoyed as Israeli citizens. The military government resulted in the exclusion of the Arabs from all the Jewish state systems, their discrimination in every domain, the deepening of their internal divides or the creation of new ones, the erasure of their identity, and the hindering of their sense as a national collective... \[p. 115\] Contemporaneous testimonies describe the raison d'etre of the military government: This was the government's way of preventing the Arabs from working in the Jewish sector, or of regulating their employment in various ways, such as time, numbers, and areas of employment – for its own convenience (Ben-Porat 1966). The military government prevented the Arabs from taking over government land and major transportation routes (this fact was determined by the Retner Committee, which examined the necessity of the military government; Kafkafi 1998). It also prevented them from taking over abandoned Arab villages, establishing new ones, or moving their homes to other places at will, especially to Jewish cities (Schiff 1962; see also Ozacky-Lazar 1998 for testimony by Colonel Shacham before the Rosen Committee in 1959). Through movement and living restrictions, the Israeli government used the military government over the Arabs to keep Arabs away from their lands, thus making it easier for the government to confiscate them (Amitai 1963b; Jiryis 1976; LA, 2-926-1957-148, January 30, 1958). The government averts modernization, industrialization, and urbanization among the Arab citizens, leaving the Arab sector at a very low level of employment and material comfort, creating very large villages with no local employment opportunities (Falah 1991b; Kafkafi 1988).31";[Lustick & Berkman 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFLustickBerkman2017), pp. 42–46, "\[p. 42\] For almost two decades, from 1948 through 1966, suffrage rights for Arab citizens coexisted with severe and systematic restrictions on the Arab population's civil liberties, economic and cultural rights, and freedom of movement. This regime of pass laws, permits, curfews, harassment, isolation, and petty punishments was enforced by poorly trained army units and administered by Jewish bureaucrats and military officers thought by the rest of the military to be incapable of performing serious military functions. The military government controlled Arabs by isolating them from Jews, fragmenting them into disconnected villages and regions, enforcing divisions among religious communities, stoking interclan rivalries among kinship groups, enlisting networks of informers, and co-opting traditionalist elites. Overall, the objective was to render the presence of Arabs – a sizable non-Jewish minority in the country – as irrelevant as possible to the life of the Jewish state (Lustick 1980). Officially established in October 1948, the military government's legal authority was rooted in emergency mandatory legislation absorbed by Israeli cabinet decree following the declaration of statehood in mid-May. The Defense Emergency Regulations "delegated effective sovereignty to the military within a specified territory and authorized its commander to suspend all basic constitutional liberties, including the property and habeas corpus rights, of its inhabitants" (Robinson 2013:33).3 Armed with these and other emergency laws, Ben-Gurion appointed Haganah commander Elimelekh Avner to oversee the military regime that replaced the ad hoc administrations set up by the army in majority Arab areas... \[p. 43\] Although loosened gradually between its establishment in 1948 and its abolition in 1966, in its first decade the military government controlled nearly every aspect of daily life in Arab areas. Formal military permits were required for opening a shop, harvesting crops, seeking medical treatment, finding a job in a Jewish city, traveling to work, or simply moving between villages for visitation. To turn the spigots of cheap Arab labor on and off when and where it was necessary for the Jewish economy, only a fraction of all Arab requests for work permits were granted. Arab farmers were not allowed to independently market their produce but rather were forced to sell it at below-market prices to state-created monopolistic marketing firms. Blacklists were used to deny politically affiliated Arabs development loans and travel authorization (Lustick 1980:184)... \[p. 45\] For nearly two decades, the military government was instrumental in stripping the Arab minority of its remaining physical assets and depriving it of an independent political base from which it could promote its national, cultural, and economic interests. This was not only its effect but its raison d'être.";[Masalha 2012](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFMasalha2012), pp. 5 ("After 1948 the Palestinians inside Israel had to endure eighteen years of military administration, which restricted their movements, controlled almost every aspect of their life and acted as an instrument for the expropriation of the bulk of their lands (Sa'di 2005: 7–26; Jiryis 1976; Lustick 1982; Kamen 1987: 484–9, 1988: 68–109; Falah 1996: 256–85; Benziman and Mansour 1992; Kretzmer 1987). The military government (1948–66) declared Palestinian villages 'closed military zones' to prevent displaced Palestinians from returning." and 230-231 ("After its establishment, Israel treated the Palestinians remaining within its frontiers almost as foreigners. It swiftly imposed a military government in the areas inhabited by the Palestinian minority, expropriated over half of the lands of this 'non-Jewish' population, and pursued various policies of demographic containment, political control, exclusionary domination, and systematic discrimination in all spheres of life. The military government, imposed by prime minister and defence minister David Ben-Gurion, became closely associated with both his hostile attitude towards the Palestinian minority and his authoritarian style and almost unchallenged leadership of the ruling Labour Party... Officially the purpose of imposing martial law and military government on Israel's Arab minority was security. However, its establishment, which lasted until 1966, was intended to serve a number of both stated and concealed objectives. The first was to prevent the return of Palestinian refugees – 'infiltrators' in Israeli terminology – to their homes. In the process, others who had not 'infiltrated' the country were sometimes driven out as well – the second objective. The third purpose of the military government was to maintain control and supervision over the Israeli Arabs, who were separated and isolated from the Jewish population. ho were separated and isolated from the Jewish population. The use of force and coercion formed an important element in Israel's policy towards its Arab citizens in the post-1948 period. The institution of the military government, together with the imposition of the Defence Emergency Regulations, promulgated by the British Mandatory authorities in 1945, empowered the military governors to close off the Arab localities and to restrict entry or exit only to those who had been issued permits by the military authorities. These regulations also enabled the Israeli authorities to evict and deport people from their villages and towns; to place individuals under administrative detention for indefinite periods without trial; and to impose fines and penalties without due process. The military governors also were authorised to close Arab areas in order to prevent internal Arab refugees (also referred to as 'present absentees', they were estimated at 30,000, or one-fifth of those remaining) from returning to their homes and lands that had been confiscated by the state and taken over by new and old Jewish settlements.");[Morris 2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFMorris2008), p. 349, "As was its wont in occupied Arab-populated areas, Israel imposed military government on the core of the Galilee.144 The inhabitants, mostly deemed hostile or of doubtful loyalty, were subjected to a strict regimen of curfews and travel restrictions, which lasted, with a gradual easing of the strictures, until 1966.";[Morris 2004](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFMorris2004), pp. 421–422, "\[p. 422\] With the help of attached IDF units, the governors ruled the communities, imposing curfews, handing out residency and travel permits, organising municipal services, dispensing food and health care to the needy, establishing schools and kindergartens, and organising search operations for infiltrating refugees and their expulsion."

Only on 16 January 1949 did the order came to stop the selective deportations from southern Lebanon, and the Minority Unit was instructed to confine its activity solely to the Galilee and the former mixed towns and cities. The mission there was clear: to prevent any attempt - and there were quite a few - by refugees to try to smuggle their way back home, no matter whether they tried to return to a village or a house to live, or just wanted to retrieve some of their personal possessions. The 'infiltrators', as the Israeli army called them, were in many cases farmers who sought surreptitiously to harvest their fields or pick the fruit from their now unattended trees. Refugees who tried to slip past the army lines quite often met their death at the hands of Israeli army patrols. In the language of Israeli intelligence reports, they were 'successfully shot at'. A quote from such a report dated 4 December 1948 records: 'successful shooting at Palestinians trying to return to the village of Blahmiyya and who attempted to retrieve their belongings.'

Most of its original 4,000–5,000 inhabitants (4/5 Muslims) had fled during Hiram. By December 1948, the village had some 700 inhabitants, 600 of them Christians, a minority of them infiltrees (inhabitants who had fled the country and then infiltrated back). The settlement authorities wanted the abandoned housing for immigrants; the military viewed settlement in the village as 'very important', as only 12 per cent of the Galilee's population at this time was Jewish. Their main fear was that, if left partially empty, the village would fill up with returnees. The villagers, for their part, lived in continuous fear of expulsion, and periodically sent delegations to plead with Israeli officials. Shitrit repeatedly interceded with Ben-Gurion and 'saved' them."), 513-514 ("Immediately after Hiram, the Israeli authorities, parallel to the start of the border-clearing operations, put their minds to the problem of the populated, semi-populated and empty Arab villages in the interior of the Galilee, to all of which refugees were returning. The fear was that with the worsening winter weather and the refugees' steady pauperisation, the influx would increase and empty and semi-populated villages would fill up anew, ultimately increasing the State's Arab minority and the security problems thus engendered... \[p. 514\] From mid-December 1948 onward, the IDF periodically mounted massive sweeps in the Galilee villages to root out returnees and expel them... But infiltrators continued to return."), 518 ("Southern Front was successful in preventing refugees from returning to the villages. In contrast with Northern Front, Yigal Allon, OC Southern Front, had completely driven out the local population during Operation Yoav and no fully or semi-populated villages were left behind his front lines (save for Majdal and Egyptian-held Faluja and 'Iraq al Manshiya in the Faluja Pocket). There were no recurrent, large-scale cat-and-mouse games as occurred in the north. So, while large-scale infiltration continued, aimed at retrieving possessions, \[p. 519\] smuggling, theft, harvest and the like, the infiltrators found it almost impossible to resettle or gain permanent footholds in the villages; there was no local population to assist them or among which they could disappear."), and 534-536 ("\[p. 534\] The clearing of the borders of Arab communities following the hostilities was initiated by the IDF but, like the expulsions of the months before, was curbed by limitations imposed by the civilian leadership and was never carried out consistently or comprehensively. Even the initial border-clearing operation in the north in November 1948, which set as its goal an Arab-free strip at least five kilometres deep, was carried out without consistency or political logic.... In terms of the army's independence in expelling or evicting Arab communities, November 1948 marked a watershed... Thereafter, the IDF almost never acted alone and independently; it sought and had to obtain approval and decisions from the supreme civilian authorities... The IDF's opinions and needs, which defined in great measure Israel's security requirements, continued to carry great weight in decision-making \[p. 535\] councils. But they were not always decisive and the army ceased to act alone... \[p. 536\] Side by side with the border-clearing operations Israel also mounted recurrent sweeps in the villages in the interior designed to root out illegal returnees and to 'shut down' minimally inhabited villages... The aim was to keep down the Arab population as well as to curtail various types of trouble that infiltrators augured. In a narrow sense, political, demographic, agricultural and economic considerations rather than military needs seem to have been decisive. The presence of Arabs in a half-empty village, given the circumstances, meant that the village would probably soon fill out with returnees. Completely depopulating the village and levelling it or filling the houses with Jewish settlers meant that infiltrators would have that many less sites to return to. In complementary fashion, filling out half-empty Arab villages (as happened at Tur'an, Mazra'a and Sha'b) with the evicted population of other villages meant that these host villages would be 'full up' and unable to accommodate many infiltrees.")

In light of the ever-growing historiography, serious scholarship has left little debate about what happened in 1948. In fact, scholars are currently fruitfully addressing issues such as the intersection of the Holocaust with its roots in European racism, and the *Nakba* with its roots in European colonisation."

The fact that in terms of the act of *tihur* (cleansing) what a nascent Israel did to Palestinians was *not* exceptional hardly makes it any less egregious, not least given that somewhere in that reckoning is the knowledge of what had happened to Jews just two or three years earlier."

When we observe this remarkably disciplined and systematic programme of settler-state formation, the complementarity between the creation of the Jewish state and the ethnic cleansing of Palestine emerges with particular clarity, the two being inseparable features of a unified programme."), and 159–161 ("In the absence of that context, the Nakba would make no sense. We might even agree with Benny Morris that ethnic cleansing was a spontaneous aberration that took place in the heat of warfare... To understand the Nakba, therefore, we have to keep in mind the crucial fact that it was Zionism's *first opportunity*. The fact that the emergent Jewish state seized this opportunity with such devastating effectiveness was both a testament to and a legacy of its preparedness. As we have seen, the creation of the Jewish state and the ethnic cleansing of Palestine were two sides of the same coin. The conquest of economics was a Nakba-in-waiting.")

The phrase *ongoing nakba* refers to the processes begun in 1948, to claim land for Jews and forcibly displace Palestinian Muslims and Christians, which continues unabated until now – most visibly in Lydda, Jaffa, and the Negev... *Judaization* refers to the process by which Israelis have covered up their crimes of ethnic cleansing not only by destroying homes and foresting over the land, but also by renaming cities and villages with those that sound more biblical, thus mythologizing a Jewish history that predates an Arab one...

This process has included the destruction of Palestinian villages. About 418 villages were erased, and out of twelve Palestinian or mixed towns, a Palestinian population continued to exist in only seven. This swift transformation of the physical and cultural environment was accompanied, at the symbolic level, by the changing of the names of streets, neighborhoods, cities, and regions. Arabic names were replaced by Zionist, Jewish, or European names. This renaming continues to convey to the Palestinians the message that the country has seen only two historical periods which attest to its "true" nature: the ancient Jewish past, and the period that began with the creation of Israel."

[^173]: [Williams 2009](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWilliams2009), p. 98: "Just as the land of Palestine was to be cleared of the unwanted presence of its inhabitants, so the period after 1948 witnessed the 'clearing' of evidence of non-Jewish cultures: in the shape of their historical and archaeological remains, from the landscape as well as the looting of their artefacts from museums and archives. Part of this was sanctioned – if secret – Israeli government policy; part of it unattributable (military) vandalism – again. Astonishingly, as well as the 'primitive' cultural relics of the Palestinian past – with something like eighty per cent of village mosques demolished in this period – the destruction also included remarkable Roman remains, as in the city of Tiberias, which happened even when Israeli officials had specifically asked for them to be spared (see Rapaport 2007). Once again, just as the Nakba contrived to be both punctual historical event and persistent catastrophic condition, so the obliteration of historic non-Jewish sites in Palestine proved to be not simply a product of the destructive ecstasy of the moment of victory in 1948, but much more of a calculated, consistent approach, a policy that is still being carried out today, in pointless demolition, bulldozing and dynamiting in cities such as Nablus and Hebron."

Yet it is around the hope of return that millions of Palestinian refugees have formed their lives. This hope has historically been nurtured by PLO politics and its tireless repetition of the 'right of return' – a mantra in PLO discourse. In addition, for hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of Palestinian refugees, there are no prospects (or desires) for integration into host societies. In Lebanon, the Palestinians have been regarded as 'human garbage' (Nasrallah 1997), indeed as 'matters out of place' (cf. Douglas 1976), and as unwanted."

In this process, a homeland discourse, a process of remembering what has been lost, is an important component... Therefore the dispersal (shatat in Arabic) and fragmentation of the Arab population of Palestine have served as uniting factors behind a modern Palestinian national identity, illuminating the facet of absence of territory as a weighty component in creations and recreations of ethnic and national identities in exile. Deterritorialised communities seek their identity in the territory, the Homeland Lost, which they can only see from a distance, if at all. The focal point of identity and politics is a place lost."
