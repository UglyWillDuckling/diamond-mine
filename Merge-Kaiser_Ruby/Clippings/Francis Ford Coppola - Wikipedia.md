**Francis Ford Coppola** ([/ ˈ k oʊ p əl ə /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [*KOH -pə-lə*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key");[^2] [^3] [^4] born April 7, 1939) [^5] is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the leading figures of the [New Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood "New Hollywood") and one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.[^1] [Coppola is the recipient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Francis_Ford_Coppola "List of awards and nominations received by Francis Ford Coppola") of five [Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards"), a [BAFTA Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Film_Awards "British Academy Film Awards"), three [Golden Globe Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards "Golden Globe Awards"), and two [Palmes d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or"), in addition to nominations for two [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") and a [Grammy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award "Grammy Award"). Coppola was honored with the [Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_G._Thalberg_Memorial_Award "Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award") in 2010, the [Kennedy Center Honors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors "Kennedy Center Honors") in 2024, and the [AFI Life Achievement Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Life_Achievement_Award "AFI Life Achievement Award") in 2025.[^13]

Coppola started his career directing *[The Rain People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rain_People "The Rain People")* (1969) and co-writing *[Patton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_\(film\) "Patton (film)")* (1970), the latter of which earned him and [Edmund H. North](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_H._North "Edmund H. North") the [Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay"). Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of *[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "The Godfather")* (1972) and *[The Godfather Part II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II "The Godfather Part II")* (1974) which both earned Academy Awards for [Best Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "Academy Award for Best Picture"), and the latter earned him [Best Director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "Academy Award for Best Director"). The films revolutionized the [gangster genre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster_film "Gangster film").[^14] Coppola released the thriller *[The Conversation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation "The Conversation")* (1974), which received the [Palme d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cannes_Film_Festival "1974 Cannes Film Festival").

His next film, the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War") epic *[Apocalypse Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now "Apocalypse Now")* (1979), had [a notoriously lengthy and strenuous production](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Darkness:_A_Filmmaker%27s_Apocalypse "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse") and also won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only ten filmmakers to have won the award twice. He later directed films such as *[The Outsiders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_\(film\) "The Outsiders (film)")* and *[Rumble Fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Fish "Rumble Fish")* (both 1983), [*The Cotton Club*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cotton_Club_\(film\) "The Cotton Club (film)") (1984), *[Peggy Sue Got Married](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Sue_Got_Married "Peggy Sue Got Married")* (1986), *[The Godfather Part III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_III "The Godfather Part III")* (1990), *[Bram Stoker's Dracula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker%27s_Dracula_\(1992_film\) "Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)")* (1992), and *[The Rainmaker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rainmaker_\(1997_film\) "The Rainmaker (1997 film)")* (1997). He also produced *[American Graffiti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Graffiti "American Graffiti")* (1973), [*The Black Stallion*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Stallion_\(film\) "The Black Stallion (film)") (1979), and *[The Secret Garden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden_\(1993_film\) "The Secret Garden (1993 film)")* (1993). Dissatisfied with the studio system, he transitioned to independent and experimental filmmaking with *[Youth Without Youth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Without_Youth_\(film\) "Youth Without Youth (film)")* (2007), *[Tetro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetro "Tetro")* (2009), *[Twixt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twixt_\(film\) "Twixt (film)")* (2011), and *[Megalopolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalopolis_\(film\) "Megalopolis (film)")* (2024).[^15]

Coppola's father [Carmine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Coppola "Carmine Coppola") was a composer whose music featured in his son's films. Many of [his relatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppola_family "Coppola family") have found success in film: his sister [Talia Shire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire "Talia Shire") is an actress, his daughter [Sofia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola "Sofia Coppola") is a director, his son [Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Coppola "Roman Coppola") is a screenwriter and his nephews [Jason Schwartzman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Schwartzman "Jason Schwartzman") and [Nicolas Cage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage "Nicolas Cage") are actors.[^16] Coppola resides in [Napa, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa,_California "Napa, California"), and since the 2010s has been a [vintner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winemaker "Winemaker"), owning a family-branded winery of his own.[^17]

Francis Ford Coppola was born in [Detroit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit "Detroit"), Michigan, in 1939, to father [Carmine Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Coppola "Carmine Coppola") (1910–1991),[^18] a [flautist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute "Flute") with the [Detroit Symphony Orchestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Symphony_Orchestra "Detroit Symphony Orchestra") and mother [Italia Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_Coppola "Italia Coppola") (née Pennino; 1912–2004), a family of second-generation Italian immigrants. His paternal grandparents came to the United States from [Bernalda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernalda "Bernalda"), Basilicata.[^19] His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, emigrated from [Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "Naples"), Italy.[^20] At the time of Coppola's birth, his father was an arranger and assistant orchestra director for *[The Ford Sunday Evening Hour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ford_Sunday_Evening_Hour "The Ford Sunday Evening Hour")*, an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "Ford Motor Company").[^21] [^22] Coppola was born at [Henry Ford Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford_Hospital "Henry Ford Hospital"), and those two connections to [Henry Ford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford "Henry Ford") inspired the Coppolas to choose the middle name "Ford" for their son.[^23] [^24]

Francis is the middle of three children: his older brother was [August Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Coppola "August Coppola"), and his younger sister is actress [Talia Shire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire "Talia Shire").[^19]

Two years after Coppola's birth, his father was named principal flutist for the [NBC Symphony Orchestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra "NBC Symphony Orchestra"), under the baton of [Arturo Toscanini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Toscanini "Arturo Toscanini"), and the family moved to New York. They settled in [Woodside, Queens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_Queens "Woodside, Queens"), where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood.

Having contracted [polio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio "Polio") as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, during which he did homemade puppet theater productions. He developed an interest in theater after reading [*A Streetcar Named Desire*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_\(play\) "A Streetcar Named Desire (play)") (1947) at age 15.[^25] He created [8 mm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film "8 mm film") feature films edited from home movies with titles such as *The Rich Millionaire* and *The Lost Wallet*.[^26] Although Coppola was a mediocre student, his interest in technology and engineering earned him the childhood nickname "Science".[^27] He trained initially for a career in music and became proficient in the [tuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba "Tuba"), eventually earning a music scholarship to the [New York Military Academy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Military_Academy "New York Military Academy").[^26] In all, Coppola attended 23 schools [^28] before he eventually graduated from [Great Neck North High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Miller_Great_Neck_North_High_School "John L. Miller Great Neck North High School").[^29]

He entered [Hofstra University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstra_University "Hofstra University") in 1955 as a theater arts major. There, he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting. This furthered his interest in directing theater, though his father disapproved and wanted him to study engineering.[^25] Coppola was profoundly impressed by [Sergei Eisenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein "Sergei Eisenstein") 's film *[October: Ten Days That Shook the World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October:_Ten_Days_That_Shook_the_World "October: Ten Days That Shook the World")* (1928), especially the quality of its [editing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing "Film editing"), and decided to pursue cinema rather than theater.[^25] He said he was influenced to become a writer by his brother August.[^28] Coppola also credits the work of [Elia Kazan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan "Elia Kazan") for influencing him as a writer and director.[^28] Coppola's classmates at Hofstra included [James Caan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan "James Caan"), [Lainie Kazan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lainie_Kazan "Lainie Kazan") and radio artist [Joe Frank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frank "Joe Frank").[^29] [^30] He later cast Kazan and Caan in his films.

While pursuing his bachelor's degree, Coppola was elected president of the university's drama group, The Green Wig, and its musical comedy club, the Kaleidoscopians. He merged the two groups into The Spectrum Players, and under his leadership, the group staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine.[^26] He won three D. H. Lawrence Awards for theatrical production and direction and received a Beckerman Award for his outstanding contributions to the school's theater arts division.[^31] While a graduate student, Coppola studied under professor [Dorothy Arzner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Arzner "Dorothy Arzner"), whose encouragement was later acknowledged as pivotal to Coppola's career.[^25]

After earning his theater arts degree from Hofstra in 1960, Coppola enrolled in [UCLA Film School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_School_of_Theater,_Film_and_Television "UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television") attending with Bart Patton and Pete (John) Broadrick.[^26] [^32] There, he directed a short horror film, *The Two Christophers*, inspired by [Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe "Edgar Allan Poe") 's " [William Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilson_\(short_story\) "William Wilson (short story)") " and *Ayamonn the Terrible*, a film about a sculptor's nightmares coming to life.[^27] He also met undergraduate film major [Jim Morrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison "Jim Morrison"), future frontman of [The Doors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors "The Doors").[^33]

In the early 1960s, Coppola made $10 per week [^34] (roughly equivalent to $103 per week today).[^35] Looking for a way to earn some extra money, he found that many colleagues from film school made money filming erotic productions known as "nudie-cuties" or "skin flicks", which showed nudity without implying any sexual act.[^36] At 21, Coppola wrote the script for *The Peeper*, a short comedy film about a [voyeur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism "Voyeurism") who tries to spy on a sensual photo shoot in the studio next to his apartment. Coppola found an interested producer, who gave him $3,000 to shoot the film. He hired [Playboy Bunny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Bunny "Playboy Bunny") [Marli Renfro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marli_Renfro "Marli Renfro") to play the model and had his friend Karl Schanzer play the voyeur. With *The Peeper* finished, Coppola found that the cartoonish aspects of the film alienated potential buyers, who did not find the 12-minute short exciting enough to screen in [adult theaters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_movie_theater "Adult movie theater").[^37]

After much rejection, Coppola received an opportunity from Premier Pictures Company, a small production company that invested in *The Wide Open Spaces*, an erotic [western](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_\(genre\) "Western (genre)") written and directed by Jerry Schafer, which had been shelved for more than a year. Both Schafer's film and *The Peeper* featured Renfro, so the producers paid Coppola $500 to combine the two films. After Coppola re-edited the picture, it was released as the [softcore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softcore_pornography "Softcore pornography") comedy *[Tonight for Sure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight_for_Sure "Tonight for Sure")* (1962).[^37] Another production company, Screen Rite Pictures, hired Coppola to do a similar job: re-cutting the German film *[Mit Eva fing die Sünde an](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mit_Eva_fing_die_S%C3%BCnde_an_\(film\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mit Eva fing die Sünde an (film) (page does not exist)")* (*Sin Began with Eve*), directed by [Fritz Umgelter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Umgelter "Fritz Umgelter"). Coppola added new color footage with British model [June Wilkinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Wilkinson "June Wilkinson") and other nude starlets.[^38] The re-edited film was released as *[The Bellboy and the Playgirls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bellboy_and_the_Playgirls "The Bellboy and the Playgirls")*. That same year, producer/director [Roger Corman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman "Roger Corman") hired Coppola as an assistant. Corman first tasked Coppola with dubbing and re-editing the Soviet science fiction film *[Nebo Zovyot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebo_Zovyot "Nebo Zovyot")* (1959), which Coppola turned into the sex-and-violence monster movie *[Battle Beyond the Sun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Beyond_the_Sun "Battle Beyond the Sun")* (1962).[^29] Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as a dialogue director for *[Tower of London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London_\(1962_film\) "Tower of London (1962 film)")* (1962), sound man for *[The Young Racers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Racers "The Young Racers")* (1963) and associate producer and one of many uncredited directors for *[The Terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_\(1963_film\) "The Terror (1963 film)")* (1963).[^31]

Coppola's first [feature film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film "Feature film") was *[Dementia 13](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_13 "Dementia 13")* (1963). While on location in Ireland for *The Young Racers*, Corman persuaded Coppola to use that film's leftover funds to make a low-budget [horror movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_movie "Horror movie").[^31] Coppola wrote a brief draft in one night, incorporating elements from [Hitchcock's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock "Alfred Hitchcock") *[Psycho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_\(1960_film\) "Psycho (1960 film)")*,[^39] and the result impressed Corman enough to give the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),[^39] Coppola directed *Dementia 13* over the course of nine days. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [cult film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film "Cult film") among horror buffs. It was on the set of *Dementia 13* that Coppola met the woman he would marry, [Eleanor Jessie Neil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Coppola "Eleanor Coppola").

In 1965, Coppola won the annual [Samuel Goldwyn Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn_Writing_Awards "Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards") for best screenplay written by a UCLA student for *Pilma, Pilma*.[^26] The honor secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [Seven Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Arts_Productions "Seven Arts Productions"). During this time, Coppola also co-wrote the scripts for *[This Property Is Condemned](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Property_Is_Condemned "This Property Is Condemned")* (1966) and *[Is Paris Burning?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Paris_Burning%3F_\(film\) "Is Paris Burning? (film)")* (1966). Coppola bought the rights to [David Benedictus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benedictus "David Benedictus") 's novel *[You're a Big Boy Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_a_Big_Boy_Now_\(novel\) "You're a Big Boy Now (novel)")* (1963) and merged it with a story idea of his own, resulting in his UCLA [thesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis "Thesis") project *[You're a Big Boy Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_a_Big_Boy_Now "You're a Big Boy Now")* (1966), which earned him his Master of Fine Arts Degree from [UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_School_of_Theater,_Film_and_Television "UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television") in 1967.[^31] [^40] [^41] The film also received a theatrical release via [Warner Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros.") and earned critical acclaim.[^29]

Francis Ford Coppola in 1973

Following the success of *You're a Big Boy Now*, Coppola was offered to work on an adaptation of the musical *[Finian's Rainbow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finian%27s_Rainbow "Finian's Rainbow")* starring dance legend [Fred Astaire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire "Fred Astaire") and [Petula Clark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petula_Clark "Petula Clark") in her first American film. Producer [Jack L. Warner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_L._Warner "Jack L. Warner") was not impressed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, " [hippie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie "Hippie") " appearance and generally left him to his own devices. Coppola took the cast to the [Napa Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California "Napa County, California") for much of the outdoor shooting, but those scenes were in sharp contrast to those filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look. None the less, [*Finian's Rainbow*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finian%27s_Rainbow_\(1968_film\) "Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)") (1968) was a critical and commercial success. Clark received a [Golden Globe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Drama "Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama") Best Actress nomination. The film introduced Coppola to [George Lucas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas "George Lucas"), who became a lifelong friend and a production assistant on his next film.

*[The Rain People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rain_People "The Rain People")* (1969) was written, directed, and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.[^29] It won the [Golden Shell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shell "Golden Shell") at the 1969 [San Sebastián International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n_International_Film_Festival "San Sebastián International Film Festival"). Coppola wanted to subvert the studio system, which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors a chance. While touring Europe, Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and, inspired by the [bohemian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism "Bohemianism") spirit of Lanterna Film, decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement unconventional approaches to filmmaking. He decided to name his future studio "Zoetrope" after receiving a gift of [zoetropes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope "Zoetrope") from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of Lanterna Film. Upon his return home, Coppola and Lucas searched for a mansion in [Marin County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_County,_California "Marin County, California") to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [Zoetrope Studio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Zoetrope "American Zoetrope") was a warehouse in [San Francisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco") on [Folsom Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folsom_Street "Folsom Street").[^42] [Andrew Sarris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris "Andrew Sarris"), in *The American Cinema* (1968), wrote: "\[Coppola\] is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making... \[He\] may be heard from more decisively in the future." [^43]

Coppola co-wrote the script for [*Patton*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_\(film\) "Patton (film)") starting in 1963 along with [Edmund H. North](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_H._North "Edmund H. North"). This earned him his first [Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay"). However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince [Franklin J. Schaffner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_J._Schaffner "Franklin J. Schaffner") that [the opening scene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_\(film\)#Opening "Patton (film)") would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview,

> I wrote the script of *Patton*. And the script was very controversial when I wrote it, because they thought it was so stylized. It was supposed to be like, sort of, you know, *[The Longest Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Day_\(film\) "The Longest Day (film)")*. And my script of *Patton* was—I was sort of interested in the reincarnation. And I had this very bizarre opening where he stands up in front of an American flag and gives this speech. Ultimately, I wasn't fired, but I was fired, meaning that when the script was done, they said, "Okay, thank you very much," and they went and hired another writer and that script was forgotten. And I remember very vividly this long, kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene.[^44]

When the title role was offered to [George C. Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott "George C. Scott"), he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. "Scott is the one who resurrected my version," said Coppola.[^45]

The movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military "Pep Talk" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [R rating](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_content_rating_system#Restricted "Motion picture content rating system"); in the opening monologue, the word "fornicating" replaced "fucking" when criticizing *[The Saturday Evening Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post "The Saturday Evening Post")*. Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons, and television shows.

*[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "The Godfather")* (1972) was a turning point in Coppola's career. However, he faced several difficulties while filming. [Paramount](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") had owned the rights to [Mario Puzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Puzo "Mario Puzo") 's [novel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_\(novel\) "The Godfather (novel)"), about an American [mafia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia "Mafia") family, for several years. Coppola was not Paramount's first choice to direct; [Sergio Leone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone "Sergio Leone") was initially offered the job but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, *[Once Upon a Time in America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_America "Once Upon a Time in America")*.[^46] [Robert Evans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Evans "Robert Evans") wanted the picture to be directed by an [Italian American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_American "Italian American") to make it "ethnic to the core".[^47] [^48] Evans' chief assistant [Peter Bart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bart "Peter Bart") suggested Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor reception of *The Rain People*.[^49] [^47] Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as "pretty cheap stuff".[^50] [^51] At the time, Coppola's studio American Zoetrope owed over $400,000 to [Warner Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros.") for budget overruns on *[THX 1138](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138 "THX 1138")* and, when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job.[^52] [^53]

Coppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970.[^54] He agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals.[^55] [^56] Coppola later found a deeper theme for the material and decided it should be not just be a film about organized crime, but also a [family saga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_saga "Family saga") and a metaphor for capitalism in America.[^47] The story follows the [Corleone family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleone_family "Corleone family") as patriarch [Vito Corleone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone "Vito Corleone") passes the reins of power to his son [Michael](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corleone "Michael Corleone"). There was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on casting; Coppola wanted to cast [Marlon Brando](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando "Marlon Brando") as Vito, though Paramount wanted either [Ernest Borgnine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine "Ernest Borgnine") or [Danny Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas "Danny Thomas"). [Orson Welles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles "Orson Welles") was also considered. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that "Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture." After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less money than his previous films, would perform a screen test, and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).[^57] Coppola chose Brando over Borgnine on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Coppola would later recall:

> *The Godfather* was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.[^39]

The film was a critical and commercial success, setting the box office record.[^58] [Pauline Kael](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael "Pauline Kael") wrote:

> Coppola, a young director who has never had a big hit, may have done the movie for money, as he claims—in order to make the pictures he really wants to make, he says—but this picture was made at peak capacity. He has salvaged Puzo’s energy and lent the narrative dignity. Given the circumstances and the rush to complete the film and bring it to market, Coppola has not only done his best but pushed himself farther than he may realize. The movie is on the heroic scale of earlier pictures on broad themes, such as *[On the Waterfront](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront "On the Waterfront")*, *[From Here to Eternity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity "From Here to Eternity")*, and [*The Nun’s Story*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nun%27s_Story_\(film\) "The Nun's Story (film)"). It offers a wide, startlingly vivid view of a Mafia dynasty. The abundance is from the book; the quality of feeling is Coppola’s... The direction is tenaciously intelligent. Coppola holds on and pulls it all together. The trash novel is there underneath, but he attempts to draw the patterns out of the particulars. It’s amazing how encompassing the view seems to be—what a sense you get of a broad historical perspective, considering that the span is only from 1945 to the mid-fifties, at which time the Corleone family, already forced by competitive pressures into dealing in narcotics, is moving its base of operations to Las Vegas.[^59]

In addition to Brando, the film starred [Al Pacino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino "Al Pacino"), [James Caan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan "James Caan"), [John Cazale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cazale "John Cazale") and [Robert Duvall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall "Robert Duvall"). It featured [Richard Castellano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Castellano "Richard Castellano"), [Sterling Hayden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hayden "Sterling Hayden"), [Diane Keaton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton "Diane Keaton") and Coppola's sister [Talia Shire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire "Talia Shire"). Brando won the [Academy Award for Best Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor "Academy Award for Best Actor"), which he refused to accept. The film won [Best Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "Academy Award for Best Picture") and the [Best Adapted Screenplay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay"). Coppola was nominated for [Best Director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "Academy Award for Best Director") but lost to [Bob Fosse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Fosse "Bob Fosse") for [*Cabaret*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_\(1972_film\) "Cabaret (1972 film)").[^60] For the [score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score "Film score"), Coppola commissioned [Nino Rota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nino_Rota "Nino Rota"), who had scored many [Fellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellini "Fellini") films. [Gordon Willis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Willis "Gordon Willis") 's [chiaroscuro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro "Chiaroscuro") cinematography was acclaimed, as was [Dean Tavoularis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Tavoularis "Dean Tavoularis") 's period production design.[^61]

The film routinely ranks near the top of polls for the greatest movies ever. It was ranked third, behind *[Citizen Kane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane "Citizen Kane")* (1941) and [*Casablanca*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_\(film\) "Casablanca (film)") (1942), on the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") 's inaugural [AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies "AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies") list in 1997. In 2007, it had moved to second place, ahead of *Casablanca* and behind *Kane*.[^62] [David Thomson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_\(film_critic\) "David Thomson (film critic)") writes that " *The Godfather* deserved all its success because it had the nerve to take its 175 minutes slowly... It has a calm faith in narrative control that had not been current in Hollywood for twenty years. It was like a film of the forties in its nostalgic decor; its command of great supporting actors; in Gordon Willis's bold exploration of a [film noir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir") in color; and in its fascination with evil." [^41]

*[The Conversation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation "The Conversation")* (1974) further cemented Coppola's reputation. It was influenced by [Michelangelo Antonioni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Antonioni "Michelangelo Antonioni") 's *[Blowup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowup "Blowup")* (1966) [^63] and generated much interest when news leaked that it featured the same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [Nixon administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_administration "Nixon administration") used to spy on political opponents in the [Watergate scandal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal "Watergate scandal"). Coppola claimed that this was purely coincidental, as the script for *The Conversation* was completed in the mid-1960s. However, audiences interpreted the film as a reaction to Watergate and its fallout. It stars [Gene Hackman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman "Gene Hackman") as Harry Caul, "the best bugger on the West Coast", hired to spy on a young couple played by [Cindy Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Williams "Cindy Williams") and [Frederic Forrest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Forrest "Frederic Forrest"). It features Cazale as his partner, Stan. The movie was a critical success and won Coppola his first [Palme d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at the [1974 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cannes_Film_Festival "1974 Cannes Film Festival").[^64] Coppola's brother-in-law [David Shire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Shire "David Shire") wrote the score and [Walter Murch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Murch "Walter Murch") edited the picture, as Coppola started work on his next project.[^65]

*[The Godfather Part II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II "The Godfather Part II")* is both [prequel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel "Prequel") and [sequel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel "Sequel") to the first film, telling parallel stories of the rise of young Vito Corleone and the fall of his son Michael. After its five-hour-long preview, George Lucas told Coppola, "You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work." Coppola claims it was the first major motion picture to use "Part II" in its title; he was influenced by [Sergei Eisenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein "Sergei Eisenstein") 's two-part [*Ivan the Terrible*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible_\(1945_film\) "Ivan the Terrible (1945 film)").[^66] Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie *The Godfather Part II*. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen *The Godfather*, there was little reason to see an addition to the original film. However, the success of *The Godfather Part II* began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels.[^67]

The movie received tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor. Kael wrote:

> Coppola has plunged us back into the sensuality and terror of the first film. And, with the relentlessness of a master, he goes farther and farther. The daring of Part II is that it enlarges the scope and deepens the meaning of the first film... The first film covered the period from 1945 to the mid-fifties. Part II, contrasting the early manhood of Vito (played by [Robert De Niro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro")) with the life of Michael, his inheritor (AI Pacino), spans almost seventy years. We saw only the middle of the story in the first film; now we have the beginning and the end. Structurally, the completed work is nothing less than the rise and decay of an American dynasty of unofficial rulers... Part II has the same mythic and operatic visual scheme as the first; once again the cinematographer is Gordon Willis. Visually the film is, however, far more complexly beautiful than the first, just as it’s thematically richer, more shadowed, more full. Willis’s workmanship has developed, like Coppola’s; even the sequences in the sunlight have deep tones — elegiac yet lyrical, as in [*The Conformist*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conformist_\(1970_film\) "The Conformist (1970 film)"), and always serving the narrative, as the Nino Rota score also does.[^68]

In addition to Pacino, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton and Shire reprised their roles from the first film. Newcomers included [Michael V. Gazzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_V._Gazzo "Michael V. Gazzo") and Pacino's mentor [Lee Strasberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg "Lee Strasberg"). *The Godfather Part II* was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.[^69] De Niro won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Vito, making him and Brando the first actors to win Oscars for playing the same character. The film ranked at No. 32 on AFI's inaugural 100 Years...100 Movies list, maintaining its position ten years later.[^62] It is ranked No. 1 on *[TV Guide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide_Magazine "TV Guide Magazine")* 's "50 Best Movies of All Time" [^70] and at No. 7 on *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly") '* s list of the "100 Greatest Movies of All Time".[^71] Together, the two *Godfather* s placed at No. 4 on *[Sight & Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound "Sight & Sound")* 's 2002 list of the ten greatest films of all time.[^72] Thomson writes that "it exhibited a mastery of so many periods and locations as to be entrancing." [^41] It was one of the last major American motion pictures to be filmed in [Technicolor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor "Technicolor").[^73]

Following the success of *The Godfather*, *The Conversation* and *The Godfather Part II*, Coppola began filming *[Apocalypse Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now "Apocalypse Now")*, an adaptation of [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad") 's *[Heart of Darkness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness "Heart of Darkness")* (1899) set in [Cambodia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "Cambodia") during the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"). It follows Willard ([Martin Sheen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen "Martin Sheen")) as he journeys upriver to find and assassinate the rogue Kurtz (Brando). The production in the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines") was plagued by numerous problems, including typhoons, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [Harvey Keitel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel "Harvey Keitel"), Sheen's heart attack, Brando arriving overweight and unprepared and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to fight rebels. It was delayed so often it was nicknamed *Apocalypse When?*[^74]

*Apocalypse Now* premiered at the [1979 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Cannes_Film_Festival "1979 Cannes Film Festival"), where Coppola made grandiose claims, among them: "My film is not about Vietnam, it *is* Vietnam." [^74] Despite such pronouncements, and complaints from critics that the film's message was confused, it shared the Palme d'Or with [Volker Schlöndorff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volker_Schl%C3%B6ndorff "Volker Schlöndorff") 's *[The Tin Drum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tin_Drum_\(film\) "The Tin Drum (film)")* [^64] and won Oscars for [Best Cinematography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography "Academy Award for Best Cinematography") ([Vittorio Storaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Storaro "Vittorio Storaro")) and [Best Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Sound "Academy Award for Best Sound") (Murch, [Mark Berger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Berger_\(sound_engineer\) "Mark Berger (sound engineer)"), [Richard Beggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Beggs "Richard Beggs") and [Nat Boxer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Boxer "Nat Boxer").) [^75] [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") wrote:

> In his book *The Films of My Life*, the French director [François Truffaut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut "François Truffaut") made a curious statement. He used to believe, he says, that a successful film had to simultaneously express "an idea of the world and an idea of cinema." But now, he writes, "I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not at all interested in anything in between; I am not interested in all those films that do not pulse."

> It may seem strange to begin a review of Franics Coppola's *Apocalypse Now* with those words, but consider them for a moment and they apply perfectly to this sprawling film. The critics who have rejected Coppola's film mostly did so on Truffaut's earlier grounds; they have arguments with the ideas about the world and the war in *Apocalypse Now*... Like all great works of art about war, *Apocalypse Now* essentially contains only one idea or message, the not-especially enlightening observation that war is hell. We do not go to see Coppola's movie for that reason—something Coppola, but not some of his critics, knows well. Coppola also knows well (and demonstrated in the *Godfather* films) that movies aren't especially good at dealing with abstract ideas—for those you'd be better turning to the written word—but they are superb for presenting moods and feelings, the look of a battle, the expression of a face, the mood of a country. *Apocalypse Now* achieves greatness not by analyzing our "experience" in Vietnam, but by re-creating, in characters and images, something of that experience.

> An example: the scene in which Robert Duvall, as a crazed lieutenant colonel, leads his troops in a helicopter assault on a village is, quite simply, the best movie battle scene ever filmed. It's simultaneously numbing, depressing and exhilarating: as the rockets jar from the helicopters and spring through the air, we're elated like kids for a half second, until the reality of the consequences sinks in...

> What's great in this film, and what will make it live for many years and speak to many audiences, is what Coppola achieves on the level Truffaut was discussing: the moments of agony and joy in making cinema. Some of those moments come at the same time; remember again the helicopter assault and its unsettling mixture of horror and exhilaration. Remember the weird beauty of the massed helicopters lifting over the trees in long shot, and the insane power of [Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner "Richard Wagner") 's music, played loudly during the attack, and you feel what Coppola was getting at: those moments as common in life as art, when the whole huge grand mystery of the world, so beautiful, so terrible, seems to hang in the balance.[^76]

The film's reputation has grown and it is now regarded by many as a masterpiece of the New Hollywood and is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made, ranking at Number 19 on the 2022 *Sight and Sound* poll.[^77] For the film, Murch was the first person to receive a credit as a Sound Designer.[^78]

The documentary *[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Darkness:_A_Filmmaker%27s_Apocalypse "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse")* (1991), directed by [George Hickenlooper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hickenlooper "George Hickenlooper"), Fax Bahr and Francis's wife, [Eleanor Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Coppola "Eleanor Coppola"), who was present through the production, chronicles the difficulties the crew went through making *Apocalypse Now* and features behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Eleanor. Coppola famously stated, "We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment and little by little, we went insane." [^79]

Coppola (left) and [Petro Vlahos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_Vlahos "Petro Vlahos")

*Apocalypse Now* marked the end of the 'golden phase' of Coppola's career.[^29] His Las Vegas-set musical fantasy *[One from the Heart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_from_the_Heart "One from the Heart")* (1982), while pioneering in its use of video-editing techniques, ended with a disastrous box-office gross of US$636,796 against a $26-million budget,[^80] and he was forced to sell the 23-acre Zoetrope Studio in 1983.[^31] He would spend the rest of the decade working to pay off his debts. Ebert wrote that the film was "a ballet of graceful and complex camera movements occupying magnificent sets, and somehow the characters get lost in the process... The storyteller of *The Godfather* has become a technician here. There are chilling parallels between Coppola’s obsessive control of this film and the character of Harry Caul, the wiretapper in Coppola’s *The Conversation* (1974), who cared only about technical results and refused to let himself think about human consequences." [^81] Later critical evaluation has been more positive; Thomson calls the film "enchanting and touching".[^41] *One from the Heart* starred Forrest, [Teri Garr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teri_Garr "Teri Garr"), [Raúl Juliá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Juli%C3%A1 "Raúl Juliá"), [Nastassja Kinski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastassja_Kinski "Nastassja Kinski") and was scored by [Tom Waits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits "Tom Waits") with [Crystal Gayle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Gayle "Crystal Gayle") singing on many tracks with Waits.

In 1983, he directed *[The Outsiders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_\(film\) "The Outsiders (film)")*, an adaptation of the [novel of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_\(novel\) "The Outsiders (novel)") by [S. E. Hinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Hinton "S. E. Hinton"). Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. *The Outsiders* is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars, including [Matt Dillon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon "Matt Dillon"), [Ralph Macchio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Macchio "Ralph Macchio") and [C. Thomas Howell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Thomas_Howell "C. Thomas Howell"). Also in the cast were [Patrick Swayze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Swayze "Patrick Swayze"), [Emilio Estevez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez "Emilio Estevez"), [Diane Lane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Lane "Diane Lane"), [Tom Cruise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise "Tom Cruise") and [Rob Lowe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe "Rob Lowe") (in his film debut). Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the score, including the title song "Stay Gold", which was based on [Robert Frost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost "Robert Frost") 's ["Nothing Gold Can Stay"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Gold_Can_Stay_\(poem\) "Nothing Gold Can Stay (poem)") and performed by [Stevie Wonder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder "Stevie Wonder"). He directed *[Rumble Fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Fish "Rumble Fish")*, filmed at the same time as *The Outsiders* on-location in [Tulsa, Oklahoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma "Tulsa, Oklahoma") and based on the [novel of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Fish_\(novel\) "Rumble Fish (novel)") by Hinton, who co-wrote the screenplay. Shot in black-and-white as an homage to [German expressionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_expressionist_film "German expressionist film"), *Rumble Fish* centers on the relationship between a revered former gang leader ([Mickey Rourke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rourke "Mickey Rourke")) and his younger brother, Rusty James (Dillon). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meager $2.5 million against a $10 million budget.[^82]

In 1984, Coppola directed the Robert Evans-produced [*The Cotton Club*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cotton_Club_\(film\) "The Cotton Club (film)"), based on the novel by [James Haskins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Haskins "James Haskins") and centered on the eponymous [Harlem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem "Harlem") [jazz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz") club. The film was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Art-Direction. However, the film failed at the box-office, earning only $25.9 million of the $47.9 million privately invested by brothers Fred and Ed Doumani.[^83] The same year, he directed "Rip Van Winkle", an adaptation of [Washington Irving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving "Washington Irving") 's [short story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle "Rip Van Winkle") starring [Harry Dean Stanton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton "Harry Dean Stanton") for [Shelley Duvall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Duvall "Shelley Duvall") 's *[Faerie Tale Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faerie_Tale_Theatre "Faerie Tale Theatre")*.[^84]

In 1986, Coppola directed *[Captain EO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_EO "Captain EO")*, a 17-minute space fantasy for [Disney theme parks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_theme_parks "Disney theme parks") executive produced by George Lucas and starring [Michael Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson "Michael Jackson").[^85] Coppola, formerly a member of [Writers Guild of America West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America_West "Writers Guild of America West"), left and maintained [financial core](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_core "Financial core") status in 1986.[^86] Also in 1986, Coppola released the comedy *[Peggy Sue Got Married](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Sue_Got_Married "Peggy Sue Got Married")* starring [Kathleen Turner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Turner "Kathleen Turner"), [Jim Carrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey "Jim Carrey") and Coppola's nephew [Nicolas Cage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage "Nicolas Cage"). The film earned Coppola positive reviews and Turner her first and only Oscar nomination. It was Coppola's first box-office success since *The Outsiders* [^87] and ranked number 17 on *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")* ' s list of "50 Best High School Movies".[^88]

The following year, Coppola re-teamed with James Caan for *[Gardens of Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_of_Stone "Gardens of Stone")*, but the film was overshadowed by the death of Coppola's eldest son [Gian-Carlo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian-Carlo_Coppola "Gian-Carlo Coppola") during the film's production. The movie was not a critical success and underperformed commercially, earning only $5.6 million against a $13 million budget.[^89] Coppola directed *[Tucker: The Man and His Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker:_The_Man_and_His_Dream "Tucker: The Man and His Dream")* the year after that. The film is a biopic based on the life of [Preston Tucker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Tucker "Preston Tucker") and his attempt to produce and market the [Tucker '48](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_automobile "Tucker automobile"); Coppola had originally conceived the project as a musical with Brando leading. Ultimately, it was [Jeff Bridges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges "Jeff Bridges") who played the role of Tucker. Budgeted at $24 million, the film received positive reviews and earned three nominations at the [62nd Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/62nd_Academy_Awards "62nd Academy Awards"), but grossed a disappointing $19.65 million at the box office. It garnered two awards: [Martin Landau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Landau "Martin Landau") won the [Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture "Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture") and [Dean Tavoularis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Tavoularis "Dean Tavoularis") took [BAFTA's honors for Best Production Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Production_Design "BAFTA Award for Best Production Design").

In 1989, Coppola teamed up with fellow Oscar-winners [Martin Scorsese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese "Martin Scorsese") and [Woody Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen "Woody Allen") for the [anthology film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_film "Anthology film") *[New York Stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stories "New York Stories")*. Coppola directed the " [Life Without Zoë](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Without_Zoe "Life Without Zoe") " segment, starring Shire and co-written with his daughter [Sofia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola "Sofia Coppola"). "Life Without Zoë" was mostly panned by critics and was generally considered to be the segment that brought the film's overall quality down.[^90] [^91] [Hal Hinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Hinson "Hal Hinson") of *[The Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")* wrote a particularly scathing review, stating: "It's impossible to know what Francis Coppola's *Life Without Zoë* is. Co-written with his daughter Sofia, the film is a mystifying embarrassment; it's by far the director's worst work yet." [^92] Zoetrope Studios finally filed for [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11_bankruptcy "Chapter 11 bankruptcy") in 1990, after which its name was changed to American Zoetrope.[^29]

Coppola at the [1996 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Cannes_Film_Festival "1996 Cannes Film Festival")

In 1990, he released the third and final chapter of *The Godfather* series: *The Godfather Part III*. Coppola felt that the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. Coppola intended *Part III* to be an epilogue to the first two films.[^93] In his [audio commentary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_commentary "Audio commentary") for *Part II*, he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of *[One from the Heart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_from_the_Heart "One from the Heart")* (1982) compelled him to take up [Paramount](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") 's long-standing offer to make a third installment.[^94] Coppola and Puzo preferred the title *The Death of Michael Corleone*, but Paramount Pictures found that unacceptable.[^93] While not as critically acclaimed as the first two films,[^95] [^96] [^97] it was still commercially successful, earning $136 million against a $54 million budget.[^98] Some reviewers criticized the casting of Coppola's daughter [Sofia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola "Sofia Coppola"), who stepped into the leading role of [Mary Corleone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Corleone "Mary Corleone"), which was abandoned by [Winona Ryder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Ryder "Winona Ryder") just as filming began.[^95] Despite this, *The Godfather Part III* went on to gather seven [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") nominations, including [Best Director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "Academy Award for Best Director") and [Best Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "Academy Award for Best Picture"). The film failed to win any of these awards, which made it the only film in the trilogy to do so.

In September 2020, for the film's 30th anniversary, it was announced that a new cut of the film titled *Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone* would have a limited theatrical release in December 2020 followed by digital and Blu-ray.[^99] Coppola said the film is the version he and Puzo had originally envisioned, and it "vindicates" its status among the trilogy and his daughter Sofia's performance.[^100] [^101]

In 1992, Coppola directed and produced *Bram Stoker's Dracula*. Adapted from [Bram Stoker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker "Bram Stoker") 's [novel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula "Dracula"), it was intended to follow the book more closely than previous film adaptations.[^102] Coppola cast [Gary Oldman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman "Gary Oldman") as the titular role, with [Keanu Reeves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves "Keanu Reeves"), [Winona Ryder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Ryder "Winona Ryder"), and [Anthony Hopkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins "Anthony Hopkins") in supporting roles. The movie became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 domestically, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of the year.[^103] It fared even better out of the country, grossing $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692 against a budget of $40 million,[^104] making it the ninth highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.[^105] The film won Academy Awards for [Costume Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Costume_Design "Academy Award for Best Costume Design"), [Makeup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Makeup_and_Hairstyling "Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling") and [Sound Editing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Sound_Editing "Academy Award for Best Sound Editing").

Coppola's next project was *Jack*, which was released on August 9, 1996. It starred [Robin Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams "Robin Williams") as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate due to [Werner syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_syndrome "Werner syndrome"), which makes him look like a 40-year-old man at the age of ten. With [Diane Lane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Lane "Diane Lane"), [Brian Kerwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kerwin "Brian Kerwin"), and [Bill Cosby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby "Bill Cosby"), *Jack* also featured [Jennifer Lopez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez "Jennifer Lopez"), [Fran Drescher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher "Fran Drescher") and [Michael McKean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McKean "Michael McKean") in supporting roles. Not a box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget,[^106] it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama.[^107] It was also unfavorably compared with the 1988 film *[Big](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_\(film\) "Big (film)")*, in which [Tom Hanks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks "Tom Hanks") also played a child in a grown man's body.[^108] Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny, and had unconvincing and unbelievable drama.[^109] Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film.[^110] Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor.[^111] When Williams was offered the screenplay for *Jack*, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.

The last film Coppola directed in the 1990s, *The Rainmaker*, was based on the 1995 [novel of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rainmaker_\(novel\) "The Rainmaker (novel)") by [John Grisham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grisham "John Grisham"). An ensemble [courtroom drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drama "Legal drama"), the film was well received by critics.[^112] [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") gave *The Rainmaker* three stars out of four, remarking: "I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer's life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer." [^113] [James Berardinelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Berardinelli "James Berardinelli") also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that "the intelligence and subtlety of *The Rainmaker* took me by surprise" and that the film "stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation." [^114] Grisham said of the film: "To me it's the best adaptation of any of \[my books\]... I love the movie. It's so well done." [^115] The film grossed about $45 million domestically,[^116] more than the estimated production budget of $40 million, but a disappointment compared to previous films adapted from Grisham novels.

According to Coppola, starting from this film onwards, he stopped working as a "professional director", preferring to act more like a student who tried to understand what meant making a film, choosing to self-finance some "very small, low-budget" movies. Thus, those films weren't meant to be successful but instead teach him what making films really mean, learning a lout about acting to the point of carrying out unusual rehearsals.[^117]

In the late 90's Coppola was a board member of MGM, and in discussion of films they already had which could not be released, *Supernova* was among the most expensive. He was approached to supervise several of these, including *The Fantastiks* and  *Supernova*, which he used his American Zoetrope facility in [Northern California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California "Northern California"). This work included digitally placing [Angela Bassett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Bassett "Angela Bassett") 's and [James Spader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Spader "James Spader") 's faces on the bodies of (a computer-tinted) [Robin Tunney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Tunney "Robin Tunney") and [Peter Facinelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Facinelli "Peter Facinelli") so that their characters could have a [love scene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_scene "Sex scene").[^118] However, Coppola's re-edited version had negative test screening and didn't get the PG-13 rating by the MPAA that the studio wanted. Creature designer [Patrick Tatopoulos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Tatopoulos "Patrick Tatopoulos"), whose special effects were mostly cut out from the film, said that [Walter Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hill "Walter Hill") wanted the film to be much more grotesque, strange, and disturbing, while MGM wanted to make it more of a hip, sexy film in space, and not with full-blown makeup effects. "I hope that my experience in the film industry has helped improve the picture and rectified some of the problems that losing a director caused", said Coppola.[^118] By October 1999, [MGM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM "MGM") decided to sell the film.[^119] The film was eventually released on January 17, 2000, almost two years later than planned.[^120]

Coppola at the [2001 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Cannes_Film_Festival "2001 Cannes Film Festival")

Coppola was the jury president at the [1996 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Cannes_Film_Festival "1996 Cannes Film Festival") and he also took part as a special guest at the 17th [Midnight Sun Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Sun_Film_Festival "Midnight Sun Film Festival") in [Sodankylä](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodankyl%C3%A4 "Sodankylä"), Finland,[^121] and the 46th International [Thessaloniki Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki_Film_Festival "Thessaloniki Film Festival") in [Thessaloniki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki "Thessaloniki"), Greece.

In the late '90s, Coppola began revisiting his films and creating new director's cuts for release on home video. The first movie to receive this treatment was *Apocalypse Now*. The new version, *[Apocalypse Now Redux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now_Redux "Apocalypse Now Redux")*, restored 49 minutes that had been cut from the film before its original release in 1979, notably a visit to a French plantation. A number of actors came in to rerecord their lines for the deleted scenes, which were of inconsistent audio quality, and new music was composed. This version was released in cinemas in 2001 and later released on DVD. In 2006, it was collected with the theatrical cut on a deluxe DVD; subsequent home video releases have included both versions.

[A. O. Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._O._Scott "A. O. Scott") wrote: " *Apocalypse Now Redux* arrives in this slack season to remind us of a lost era of visionary cinema, a time of creative self-confidence that frequently flirted with hubris, but also a time of risk taking and high seriousness. The artistic vision on display in *Apocalypse Now* -- the divine madness that inspired Mr. Coppola to risk his health, his sanity, his fortune and the well-being of his cast, crew and family -- is ultimately less impressive, and less important to the film's durable power, than the art itself." [^122]

In 2005, Coppola created a new cut of *The Outsiders* for home video. This version, titled *The Outsiders: The Complete Novel*, added more than 20 minutes of footage and removed three scenes, bringing the film's runtime from 91 minutes to 114 minutes. It also added new music by [Michael Seifert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Seifert_\(producer\) "Michael Seifert (producer)") and Dave Pruitt and several period songs to Carmine Coppola's score. Coppola included both the theatrical cut and "The Complete Novel" on all subsequent home video releases.

After a ten-year hiatus, Coppola returned to directing with *[Youth Without Youth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Without_Youth_\(film\) "Youth Without Youth (film)")* in 2007, based on the [novella of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Without_Youth_\(novella\) "Youth Without Youth (novella)") by Romanian author [Mircea Eliade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade "Mircea Eliade"). The film received generally negative reviews from critics.[^123] It was made for about $19 million and had a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office.[^124] As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films, which are intended to appeal to too wide an audience.

In 2009, Coppola released *[Tetro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetro "Tetro")*. It was set in [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), with the reunion of two brothers. The story follows the rivalries born out of creative differences passed down through generations of an artistic [Italian immigrant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_diaspora "Italian diaspora") family.[^125] The film received generally positive reviews from critics.[^126] [^127] The [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes") site's consensus was: "A complex meditation on family dynamics, *Tetro* 's arresting visuals and emotional core compensate for its uneven narrative." [^127] [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") of the *[Chicago Sun-Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times "Chicago Sun-Times")* gave the film three stars, praising it for being "boldly operatic, involving family drama, secrets, generations at war, melodrama, romance and violence", Ebert also praised [Vincent Gallo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Gallo "Vincent Gallo") 's performance and claimed that [Alden Ehrenreich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alden_Ehrenreich "Alden Ehrenreich") is "the new [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio "Leonardo DiCaprio") ".[^128] Todd McCarthy of *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* gave the film a B+, judging that "when Coppola finds creative [nirvana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana "Nirvana"), he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods".[^129] [Richard Corliss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Corliss "Richard Corliss") of *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich's performance, but claiming Coppola "has made a movie in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true".[^130] The film made $2,636,774 worldwide,[^131] against a budget of $5,000,000.

*[Twixt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twixt_\(film\) "Twixt (film)")*, starring [Val Kilmer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Kilmer "Val Kilmer"), [Elle Fanning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning "Elle Fanning"), [Joanne Whalley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Whalley "Joanne Whalley"), and [Bruce Dern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dern "Bruce Dern"), and narrated by [Tom Waits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits "Tom Waits"), was released to film festivals in late 2011 [^132] and was released theatrically in early 2012. It received critical acclaim in France,[^133] but mostly negative reviews elsewhere.[^134]

In 2015, Coppola stated

> That's why I ended my career: I decided I didn't want to make what you could call 'factory movies' anymore. I would rather just experiment with the form, and see what I could do, and \[make things\] that came out of my own. And little by little, the commercial film industry went into the superhero business, and everything was on such a scale. The budgets were so big, because they wanted to make the big series of films where they could make two or three parts. I felt I was no longer interested enough to put in the extraordinary effort a film takes \[nowadays\].[^135]

*[Distant Vision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_Vision "Distant Vision")* is a semi-autobiographical unfinished live broadcast project created in real-time. [Proof of concepts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept "Proof of concept") were tested before limited audiences at [Oklahoma City Community College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Community_College "Oklahoma City Community College") in June 2015 and [UCLA School of Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_School_of_Theater "UCLA School of Theater") in July 2016.[^136]

In 2015, Coppola found an old Betamax tape with his original cut of *The Cotton Club* and decided to restore it. He had cut about a half hour out of the film before its original release at the insistence of the film's European financial backers. Due to a combination of music rights, the loss of the original negative, audio issues, and MGM's lack of interest in the project, Coppola wound up spending 500,000 dollars of his own money restoring the film.[^137] It was finally finished in 2017 and premiered at the [Telluride Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluride_Film_Festival "Telluride Film Festival") in 2019 as *The Cotton Club Encore*.

After finishing work on *The Cotton Club*, Coppola began work on a director's cut of his first movie, *Dementia 13*. For this film, Coppola removed several minutes of footage that had been added by the film's producer, Roger Corman.[^138] In 2019, he followed it up with another director's cut of *Apocalypse Now*, this time called "The Final Cut". It removed 20 minutes of footage that had been included in *Apocalypse Now Redux* and restored the film from the original negative for the first time.[^139]

In December 2020, a [re-edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-edited_film "Re-edited film") of *Godfather III*, *The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone* had a limited theatrical release, followed by digital and Blu-ray release in 2021.[^140] Coppola stated that *The Godfather: Part IV* was never made because Mario Puzo died before they had a chance to write the film.[^141] [Andy García](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Garc%C3%ADa "Andy García") has since claimed the film's script was nearly produced.[^141]

Coppola's most recent director's cut to date was *B'Twixt Now and Sunrise*, a shortened version of his film *Twixt*. It was given a select re-release in 2022.[^142]

At the [94th Academy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards "94th Academy Awards"), they celebrated the 50th anniversary of *[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_\(film\) "The Godfather (film)")*. Coppola attended alongside [Robert De Niro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro") and [Al Pacino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino "Al Pacino") who were greeted with a standing ovation.[^143]

In April 2019, Coppola announced that he planned to direct *Megalopolis*, which he had been developing for many years prior.[^144] Speaking to *[Deadline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood "Deadline Hollywood")*, he said: "I plan this year to begin my longstanding ambition to make a major work utilizing all I have learned during my long career, beginning at age 16 doing theater, and that will be an epic on a grand scale, which I've titled *Megalopolis*." [^145] He had planned to direct the movie, a story about the aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, many years earlier, but after the real-life disaster of the [September 11 attacks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks"), the project was seen as being too sensitive.[^146]

In August 2021, it was announced that Coppola had begun discussions with actors for the project and that he was aiming to begin principal photography in the fall of 2022.[^147] In April 2022, it was reported that filming was to take place from September 6, 2022, to February 2, 2023. In May 2022, the star cast was revealed: [Adam Driver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Driver "Adam Driver"), [Forest Whitaker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker "Forest Whitaker"), [Nathalie Emmanuel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathalie_Emmanuel "Nathalie Emmanuel"), [Jon Voight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Voight "Jon Voight"), and [Laurence Fishburne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne "Laurence Fishburne").[^148] In July, it was reported that filming would instead begin in November 2022 at [Trilith Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilith_Studios "Trilith Studios") in [Fayetteville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_Georgia "Fayetteville, Georgia"), [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(U.S._state\) "Georgia (U.S. state)").[^149] [^150] In August, it was revealed that [Aubrey Plaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza "Aubrey Plaza"), [Talia Shire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_Shire "Talia Shire"), [Shia LaBeouf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf "Shia LaBeouf"), [Jason Schwartzman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Schwartzman "Jason Schwartzman"), [Kathryn Hunter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Hunter "Kathryn Hunter"), [Laurence Fishburne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne "Laurence Fishburne"), [James Remar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Remar "James Remar"), and [Grace VanderWaal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_VanderWaal "Grace VanderWaal") joined the cast.[^151] [^152] In early October, it was announced that [Chloe Fineman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Fineman "Chloe Fineman"), [Dustin Hoffman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman "Dustin Hoffman"), Bailey Ives, Isabelle Kusman, and [D.B. Sweeney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.B._Sweeney "D.B. Sweeney") would also be joining the cast.[^153]

On February 29, 2024, *[Deadline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood "Deadline Hollywood")* reported that *Megalopolis* will be released in [IMAX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX "IMAX") in Fall 2024.[^154] On April 9, 2024, it was revealed that *Megalopolis* would be premiering in competition at the [77th Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Cannes_Film_Festival "2024 Cannes Film Festival").

In August 2024, one month ahead of the release of *Megalopolis*, Coppola told *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* that he is not going to retire after his longtime passion project's release, intending to work on two projects: an adaptation of *[The Glimpses of the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glimpses_of_the_Moon_\(Wharton_novel\) "The Glimpses of the Moon (Wharton novel)")* with "strong dance and musical elements" [^155] he plans to produce in [England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") and *[Distant Vision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_Vision "Distant Vision")*, a "live cinema" project he's been working on since 2015 that tells the fictionalized story of three generations within an [Italian American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans "Italian Americans") family during the phenomenon of [television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television") 's invention.[^117]

In 1971, Coppola produced [George Lucas'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas "George Lucas") first feature film, *[THX 1138](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138 "THX 1138")*. Shortly after completion of production they brought the finished film to [Warner Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros."), along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly founded company, American Zoetrope. However, studio executives strongly disliked all of the scripts, including *THX*, and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film. The debt nearly closed Zoetrope and forced Coppola to reluctantly focus on *[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "The Godfather")*.[^156] American Zoetrope produced the film *[Clownhouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clownhouse "Clownhouse")*, the director of which, [Victor Salva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva "Victor Salva"), was convicted of child sexual abuse and child pornography offences occurring during the making of that film.[^157] In 2006, Coppola said, "You have to remember, while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small -- Victor was practically a child himself." Salva was 29 at the time while the boy was 12.[^158]

American Zoetrope also administers the Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000 as the culmination of more than four years of work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, as well as new departments for other creative endeavors such as the short story vending machine project.[^159]

In the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th-century [Carlo Collodi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Collodi "Carlo Collodi") novel *[The Adventures of Pinocchio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio "The Adventures of Pinocchio")*, and in 1991, Coppola and [Warner Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros.") began discussing the project as well as two others, one involving the life of [J. Edgar Hoover](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover "J. Edgar Hoover") and the other based on the children's novel *[The Secret Garden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden#Adaptations "The Secret Garden")*. These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the *Pinocchio* project for Warner Bros. as well as *[The Secret Garden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden_\(1993_film\) "The Secret Garden (1993 film)")* (which was made in 1993 and produced by [American Zoetrope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Zoetrope "American Zoetrope"), but directed by [Agnieszka Holland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnieszka_Holland "Agnieszka Holland")) and *Hoover*, which never came to fruition. A film was eventually made by [Clint Eastwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood "Clint Eastwood") in 2011 titled *[J. Edgar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar "J. Edgar")*, which was distributed by Warner Bros.

However, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. came to a disagreement over the compensation to Coppola for his directing services on *Pinocchio*.[^160] In 1994, Coppola later approached another studio, [Columbia Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures "Columbia Pictures"), to produce the film.[^161] Warner Brothers then wrote to Columbia, stating it had held the rights to Coppola's project, which led to Columbia later dropping the project. Coppola filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros, alleging they had wrongfully prevented Columbia Pictures from making the film.[^162]

The parties deferred this issue and a settlement was finally reached on July 3, 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the *Pinocchio* film project.[^163] On that same day, Warner Bros. stated it would appeal the decision.[^164] A week later, Coppola was awarded a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version.[^162] However, in October 1998, then-Superior Court Judge Madeleine Flier reversed the jury's $60 million award to Coppola.[^165] Warner Bros. and Coppola then appealed each other's ruling, in which Coppola sought to have his $60 million award restored. In March 2001, the [California Court of Appeals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Court_of_Appeals "California Court of Appeals") decided against Coppola on both counts.[^166] In July 2001, the [California Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Supreme_Court "California Supreme Court") refused to hear the appellate decision, bringing the litigation battle to a conclusive end.[^167]

During the filming of *Contact* on December 28, 1996, Coppola filed a lawsuit against [Carl Sagan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan") and [Warner Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros.") Sagan had died a week earlier,[^168] [^169] and Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel *[Contact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_\(novel\) "Contact (novel)")* was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975 titled *First Contact*.[^168] Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project as well as any novel Sagan would write with [American Zoetrope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Zoetrope "American Zoetrope") and [Children's Television Workshop Productions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Workshop "Sesame Workshop"). The television program was never produced, but in 1985, [Simon & Schuster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Schuster "Simon & Schuster") published Sagan's *Contact* and Warner Bros. moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.[^168] Even though Sagan was shown to have violated some of the terms of the agreement, the case was dismissed in February 1998 because Coppola had waited too long to file suit.[^170]

George Altamura, a real estate developer, announced in 2003 that he had partnered with several people, including Coppola, in a project to restore the [Uptown Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptown_Theater_\(Napa,_California\) "Uptown Theater (Napa, California)") in [downtown Napa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Napa,_California "Downtown Napa, California"), California, in order to create a live entertainment venue.[^171]

Coppola is the owner of **Francis Ford Coppola Presents**, a [lifestyle brand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_brand "Lifestyle brand") under which he markets goods from companies he owns or controls. It includes films and videos, resorts, cafes, a literary magazine, a line of pastas and pasta sauces called Mammarella Foods, and a winery.[^172] [^173] [^174]

The Francis Ford Coppola Winery near [Geyserville, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyserville,_California "Geyserville, California"),[^175] located on the former Chateau Souverain Winery,[^176] where he has opened a family-friendly facility, is influenced by the idea of the [Tivoli Gardens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli_Gardens "Tivoli Gardens") in [Copenhagen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen "Copenhagen"),[^177] with swimming pools, [bocce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocce "Bocce") courts, and a restaurant. The winery displays several of Coppola's [Oscars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") along with memorabilia from his movies, including [Vito Corleone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone "Vito Corleone") 's desk from *[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "The Godfather")* and a restored [1948 Tucker Sedan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Tucker_Sedan "1948 Tucker Sedan") as used in *[Tucker: The Man and His Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker:_The_Man_and_His_Dream "Tucker: The Man and His Dream")*.

In August 2021, Coppola sold Francis Ford Coppola Winery and Virginia Dare Winery to Delicato Family Wines.[^178]

Coppola, with his family, expanded his business ventures to include winemaking in California's [Napa Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_Valley_AVA "Napa Valley AVA"), when in 1975, he purchased the former home and adjoining vineyard of [Gustave Niebaum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Niebaum "Gustave Niebaum") in [Rutherford, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford,_California "Rutherford, California") using proceeds from *[The Godfather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather "The Godfather")*.[^179] His winery produced its first vintage in 1977 with the help of his father, wife, and children stomping the grapes barefoot. Every year, the family has a harvest party to continue the tradition.[^180]

After purchasing the property, he produced wine under the Niebaum-Coppola label. He purchased the former [Inglenook Winery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglenook_Winery "Inglenook Winery") chateau in 1995,[^181] and renamed it to [Rubicon Estate Winery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon_Estate_Winery "Rubicon Estate Winery") in 2006. On April 11, 2011, Coppola acquired the Inglenook [trademark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") [^182] paying more, he said, for the trademark than he did for the entire estate [^183] and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic original name, Inglenook. Its grapes are entirely organically grown.

In October 2018, Coppola and family purchased the Vista Hills winery in Dayton, Oregon,[^184] and in 2019 renamed it to Domaine de Broglie.[^185]

*Palazzo Margherita* in [Bernalda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernalda "Bernalda"), owned by Coppola

Included in the Francis Ford Coppola Presents [lifestyle brand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_brand "Lifestyle brand") are several hotels and resorts, part of Coppola's Hideaway company. The Blancaneaux Lodge in [Belize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize "Belize"), which from the early 1980s was a family retreat until it was opened to the public in 1993 as a 20-room luxury resort and The Turtle Inn, in [Placencia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placencia "Placencia"), Belize, (both of which have won several prestigious awards including "Travel + Leisure's World's Best: Best Resort in Central & South America");[^186] [^187] La Lancha in [Lago Petén Itzá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lago_Pet%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1 "Lago Petén Itzá"), [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala");[^188] Jardín Escondido in [Buenos Aires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires"), Argentina;[^189] [Palazzo Margherita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Margherita_\(Bernalda\) "Palazzo Margherita (Bernalda)") in [Bernalda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernalda "Bernalda"), Italy;[^190] and the All-Movie Hotel in [Peachtree City, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_City,_Georgia "Peachtree City, Georgia"), US.[^191]

In San Francisco, Coppola owns a restaurant named [Cafe Zoetrope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Zoetrope#Cafe_Zoetrope "American Zoetrope"), located in the Sentinel Building where American Zoetrope is based.[^192] It serves traditional Italian cuisine and wine from his [personal estate vineyard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglenook_\(Winery\) "Inglenook (Winery)"). For 14 years from 1994, Coppola co-owned the Rubicon restaurant in San Francisco along with [Robin Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams "Robin Williams") and [Robert De Niro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro"). Rubicon closed in August 2008.[^193]

Coppola bought into the San Francisco-based magazine *City of San Francisco* in 1973,[^194] [^195] with the intent of publishing [^196] [^197] [^199] a "service magazine" that informed readers about sights and activities in selected cities.[^200] The magazine was unsuccessful,[^201] and he lost $1.5 million on this venture.[^202]

In 1997, Coppola co-founded with [Adrienne Brodeur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Brodeur "Adrienne Brodeur"), the [literary magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_magazine "Literary magazine") *[Zoetrope: All-Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope:_All-Story "Zoetrope: All-Story")* which was devoted to short stories and design. The magazine publishes fiction by emerging writers alongside more recognizable names, such as [Woody Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen "Woody Allen"), [Margaret Atwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood "Margaret Atwood"), [Haruki Murakami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami "Haruki Murakami"), [Alice Munro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro "Alice Munro"), [Don DeLillo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_DeLillo "Don DeLillo"), [Mary Gaitskill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Gaitskill "Mary Gaitskill"), and [Edward Albee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Albee "Edward Albee"); as well as essays, including ones from [Mario Vargas Llosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Vargas_Llosa "Mario Vargas Llosa"), [David Mamet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet "David Mamet"), [Steven Spielberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg "Steven Spielberg"), and [Salman Rushdie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie "Salman Rushdie").

In 2018, Coppola launched Sana Company LLC and released a [cannabis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis "Cannabis") brand known as The Grower's Series.[^203] [^204] The collection was created in partnership with the Humboldt Brothers, a [Humboldt County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_County,_California "Humboldt County, California") cannabis farm.[^205] Coppola debuted the brand in [San Francisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco"), [California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California") in October 2018 at the private cannabis dining club series known as Thursday Infused, organized by The Herb Somm, [Jamie Evans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Evans "Jamie Evans").[^206] [^204] Coppola packaged The Grower's Series in a mock black tin wine bottle resembling his wine brand.[^207] The Grower's Series showcases three [cannabis strains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_strain "Cannabis strain"): a [sativa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa "Cannabis sativa"), [indica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_indica "Cannabis indica") and hybrid.[^208]

Coppola appeared in a commercial for [Suntory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suntory "Suntory") Reserve in 1980 alongside [Akira Kurosawa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa "Akira Kurosawa"); the commercial was filmed while Kurosawa was making *[Kagemusha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagemusha "Kagemusha")*, which Coppola produced with George Lucas.[^209]

In 1963, Coppola married writer and documentary filmmaker [Eleanor Jessie Neil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Coppola "Eleanor Coppola"). She went on to co-direct *[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Darkness:_A_Filmmaker%27s_Apocalypse "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse")*. Together they had three children, [Gian-Carlo Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian-Carlo_Coppola "Gian-Carlo Coppola"), [Roman Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Coppola "Roman Coppola"), and [Sofia Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola "Sofia Coppola"), all of whom became filmmakers. Gian-Carlo died in 1986 at the age of 22 due to a speedboating accident. He had one child, [Gia Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Coppola "Gia Coppola"), also a filmmaker. [Nicolas Cage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage "Nicolas Cage") and [Jason Schwartzman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Schwartzman "Jason Schwartzman") are Coppola's nephews.

Eleanor Coppola died on April 12, 2024, at the age of 87.[^211]

During the [1980 United States presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election "1980 United States presidential election"), Coppola filmed a mass televised rally for [California Governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Governor "California Governor") and [Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") presidential candidate [Jerry Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown "Jerry Brown") at the [Wisconsin State Capitol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_State_Capitol "Wisconsin State Capitol") in [Madison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin "Madison, Wisconsin"). The rally failed in its goal to draw attention away from the other [Democratic primary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries "1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries") candidates [Jimmy Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter "Jimmy Carter") and [Ted Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy "Ted Kennedy"), forcing Brown to drop out of the race.[^212] Over the years, Coppola has worked with several Democratic political candidates, including [Mike Thompson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Thompson_\(California_politician\) "Mike Thompson (California politician)") and [Nancy Pelosi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi "Nancy Pelosi") for the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives "U.S. House of Representatives"), and [Barbara Boxer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Boxer "Barbara Boxer") and [Alan Cranston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cranston "Alan Cranston") for the [U.S. Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Senate "U.S. Senate").[^213]

In 2012, Coppola participated in the *[Sight & Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound "Sight & Sound")* film polls of that year. It is held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, by asking contemporary directors to select ten films of their choice.[^214]

For *The Godfather Part II* and *The Conversation*, Coppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. [Victor Fleming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Fleming "Victor Fleming") was the first, with *[Gone with the Wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_\(film\) "Gone with the Wind (film)")* and [*The Wizard of Oz*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\(1939_film\) "The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)") in 1939; [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock "Alfred Hitchcock") repeated the feat the next year with *[Foreign Correspondent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Correspondent_\(film\) "Foreign Correspondent (film)")* and [*Rebecca*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_\(1940_film\) "Rebecca (1940 film)"). Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: [Herbert Ross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ross "Herbert Ross") with *[The Goodbye Girl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goodbye_Girl "The Goodbye Girl")* and *[The Turning Point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turning_Point_\(1977_film\) "The Turning Point (1977 film)")* in 1977 and [Steven Soderbergh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh "Steven Soderbergh") with *[Erin Brockovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Brockovich_\(film\) "Erin Brockovich (film)")* and *[Traffic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_\(2000_film\) "Traffic (2000 film)")* in 2000. He is one of ten directors to receive the Palme d'Or twice, for *The Conversation* and *Apocalypse Now*.

On October 15, 2024, after having received the statue of the Capitoline Wolf, Rome's highest honor, a street in the same capital city was named after him as a further sign of the connection between the filmmaker and the city.[^215] In 2024, he was honored by the [Kennedy Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center "Kennedy Center").[^13] Introducing him, his friend [George Lucas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas "George Lucas") said: “What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs. When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.” [^216] He is scheduled to receive the [AFI Life Achievement Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Life_Achievement_Award "AFI Life Achievement Award") in April, 2025.[^217]
