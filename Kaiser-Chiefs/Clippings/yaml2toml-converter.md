## YAML to TOML converter

This is a tool which helps to convert YAML data to TOML format using Jinja2 template.

## Motivation

[YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) and [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) are languages used to describe a data structures often used in configuration files. TOML is relatively young language which is trying minimalize the configuration file format.

Sometimes it's necessary to use YAML as the description of the configuration file and then it's necessary to do the conversion. For example in [Ansible](http://ansible.com/), everything is defied as YAML and if a program managed by Ansible (e.g. [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com/)) needs to have config file in TOML format, it's necessay to convert the YAML data to TOML format via template.

## Coversion

A YAML file can be converted as follows:

```
$ ./yaml2toml.py -y ./tests/example.yaml
```

or

```
$ cat ./tests/example.yaml | ./yaml2toml.py
```

It is also possible to use Ansible playbook to do the conversion:

```
$ ansible-playbook --diff -i hosts ./yaml2toml_playbook.yaml
```

The output of the Ansible playbook conversion is then in the file `output.toml`.

## Limitation

Jinja2 doesn't provide any filters for `datetime` so this converter fails if you use `datetime` types in the YAML data. The workaround is to quote the `datetime` values.

## Files

- `yaml2toml.py` - conversion script written in Python
- `yaml2toml_macro.j2` - Jinja2 template with the macro which does the conversion from YAML to TOML
- `yaml2toml_example.j2` - Jinja2 template calling the yaml2toml macro
- `yaml2toml.yaml` - Ansible playbook doing the conversion
- `hosts` - inventory file used by Ansible
- `tests/*` - testing files

## Requirements

- Python v2
- `jinja` Python module
- `yaml` Python module
- Ansible (optional)
