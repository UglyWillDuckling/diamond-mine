> [[coverage table creation def]]

	- [x] make a [[list of places that modify table biz_product_coverage]]
	- [x] **check** **diagram** for the transac solution
	- [x] ? make a [[list of places that use the table]]

This `city_id` is only used as a **filter**. It takes all irises for **one** city from the `geo` table  
 and performs an insert into `coverage`. The Backyard is just a way to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">trigger</mark> an update of  certain cities.

- ? Not sure what is the relation(mapping) between the different `id` fields in the coverage table.

- & **Place** **id** **is** **the id** from the `geo_place2` table
	- it functions as a `foreign key`[^1]

- [x] merge [[Media API Clients repo]] PR https://github.com/MeilleursAgents/MA-ApiClients/pull/361
