The **First Opium War** ([Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 第一次鴉片戰爭; [pinyin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): *Dìyīcì yāpiàn zhànzhēng*), also known as the **Anglo-Chinese War**, was a series of military engagements fought between the [British Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") and the Chinese [Qing dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") between 1839 and 1842. The immediate issue was the Chinese enforcement of their ban on the [opium trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_opium_in_China "History of opium in China") by seizing private opium stocks from mainly British merchants at [Guangzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou") (then named *Canton*) and threatening to impose the death penalty for future offenders. Despite the opium ban, the British government supported the merchants' demand for compensation for seized goods, and insisted on the principles of [free trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade") and equal diplomatic recognition with China. Opium was Britain's single most profitable commodity trade of the 19th century. After months of tensions between the two states, the [Royal Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") launched an expedition in June 1840, which ultimately defeated the Chinese using technologically superior ships and weapons by August 1842. The British then imposed the [Treaty of Nanking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking "Treaty of Nanking"), which forced China to increase foreign trade, give compensation, and cede [Hong Kong Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island "Hong Kong Island") to the British. Consequently, the opium trade continued in China. Twentieth-century nationalists considered 1839 the start of a [century of humiliation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_humiliation "Century of humiliation"), and many historians consider it the beginning of modern Chinese history.

In the 18th century, the European demand for Chinese luxury goods (particularly silk, porcelain, and tea) created a trade imbalance between China and Britain. [European silver flowed into China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_silver_trade_from_the_16th_to_18th_centuries "Global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries") through the [Canton System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_System "Canton System"), which confined incoming foreign trade to the southern port city of Guangzhou. To counter this imbalance, the British [East India Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") began to grow [opium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium "Opium") in [Bengal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal") and allowed private British merchants to sell opium to Chinese smugglers for illegal sale in China. The influx of narcotics reversed the Chinese [trade surplus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_surplus "Trade surplus") and increased the numbers of opium addicts inside the country, outcomes that seriously worried Chinese officials.

Senior government officials within the country had been shown to be colluding against the imperial ban due to stocks of opium in European warehouses in clear view being ignored. In 1839, the [Daoguang Emperor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoguang_Emperor "Daoguang Emperor"), rejecting proposals to legalise and tax opium, appointed Viceroy of Huguang [Lin Zexu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Zexu "Lin Zexu") to go to Guangzhou to halt the opium trade completely.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Fay-2000l-10"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Lin wrote an open letter to [Queen Victoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria "Queen Victoria") appealing to her moral responsibility to stop the opium trade, although she never received it.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Fay_p143-11"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Lin then resorted to using force in the western merchants' enclave. He arrived in Guangzhou at the end of January 1839 and organized a coastal defence. In March 1839, British opium dealers were forced to hand over 1,420 tonnes (3.1 million lb) of opium. On 3 June 1839, Lin ordered the opium to be destroyed in public on [Humen Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humen "Humen") to show the Government's determination to ban smoking.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Britannica-14"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> All other supplies were confiscated and a blockade of foreign ships on the Pearl River was ordered.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Farooqui-2005-15"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>

Tensions escalated in July 1839 after drunk British sailors killed a Chinese villager named Lin Weixi; the British official in charge, Admiral [Charles Elliot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Elliot "Charles Elliot"), refused to hand over those accused to Chinese authorities in an attempt to avoid their being killed on the spot, as had happened with British citizens in the [*Lady Hughes* Affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Hughes_Affair "Lady Hughes Affair") of 1784. Later, fighting broke out, with the British navy destroying the Chinese naval blockade, and launching an offensive.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Britannica-14"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> In the ensuing conflict, the Royal Navy used its superior naval and gunnery power to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1842, the Qing dynasty was forced to sign the [Treaty of Nanking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking "Treaty of Nanking") —the first of what the Chinese later called the [unequal treaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaties "Unequal treaties") —which granted an [indemnity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity "Indemnity") and [extraterritoriality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality "Extraterritoriality") to British subjects in China, opened five [treaty ports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_ports "Treaty ports") to British merchants, and ceded [Hong Kong Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island "Hong Kong Island") to the British Empire. The failure of the treaty to satisfy British goals of improved trade and diplomatic relations led to the [Second Opium War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War "Second Opium War") (1856–1860). The resulting social unrest was the background for the [Taiping Rebellion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion "Taiping Rebellion"), which further weakened the Qing regime.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>
