Here are some examples of number arithmetic in Python, demonstrating basic operations:

### 1. Addition
```python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print("Addition:", result)  # Output: Addition: 8
```

### 2. Subtraction
```python
a = 10
b = 4
result = a - b
print("Subtraction:", result)  # Output: Subtraction: 6
```

### 3. Multiplication
```python
a = 7
b = 6
result = a * b
print("Multiplication:", result)  # Output: Multiplication: 42
```

### 4. Division
```python
a = 20
b = 4
result = a / b
print("Division:", result)  # Output: Division: 5.0
```

### 5. Floor Division
```python
a = 20
b = 3
result = a // b
print("Floor Division:", result)  # Output: Floor Division: 6
```

### 6. Modulus
```python
a = 20
b = 3
result = a % b
print("Modulus:", result)  # Output: Modulus: 2
```

### 7. Exponentiation
```python
a = 2
b = 3
result = a ** b
print("Exponentiation:", result)  # Output: Exponentiation: 8
```

### 8. Combining Operations
```python
a = 5
b = 10
c = 2
result = (a + b) * c
print("Combined Operations:", result)  # Output: Combined Operations: 30
```
