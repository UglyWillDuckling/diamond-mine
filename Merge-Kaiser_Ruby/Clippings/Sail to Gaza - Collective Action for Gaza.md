WE'RE SAILING TO GAZA

MOVEMENT PARTICIPANTS

Coordinators, organizers, and participants from the Maghreb Sumud Flotilla, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition\*, Global Movement to Gaza, and the Sumud Nusantara have united under a common goal: to break the illegal siege on Gaza by sea, open a humanitarian corridor, and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people. This Summer, dozens of boats will set sail from ports around the world, large and small, converging toward Gaza in the largest coordinated civilian flotilla in history.

A grassroots movement organizing global solidarity actions to support Gaza and break the siege. Formerly known as Global March to Gaza.

FFC supports all efforts to break the blockade of Gaza. Where possible, they are supporting efforts with advice and expertise based on 15 years of experience on sea missions.

North Africa-based solidarity missions delivering aid and support to Palestinian communities. Formerly known as Sumud Convoy.

A people-led convoy from Malaysia and 8 other countries, inspired by the Palestinian spirit of sumud (resilience), that aims to break the Gaza blockade and rebuild Global South solidarity.

WHO WE ARE

We are a coalition of everyday people—organizers, humanitarians, doctors, artists, clergy, lawyers, and seafarers—who believe in human dignity and the power of nonviolent action.

In June, we launched a globally coordinated mobilization by land, sea, and air. In Summer, we return with a unified strategy: one goal and global coordination like never before.

Our efforts build on decades of Palestinian resistance and international solidarity. Though we belong to/hold different nations, faiths, and political beliefs, we are united by a single truth: the siege and genocide must end.

We are independent, international, and unaffiliated with any government or political party. Our allegiance is to justice, freedom, and the sanctity of human life.

FAQ

The Global Sumud Flotilla is a coordinated, nonviolent fleet of mostly small vessels sailing from ports across the Mediterranean to break the Israeli occupation's illegal siege on Gaza. It brings together a diverse coalition of international participants, including those involved in previous land and sea efforts like the Maghreb Sumud Flotilla, Freedom Flotilla Coalition\*, and Global Movement to Gaza. Each boat represents a community and a refusal to stay silent in the face of genocide.

The Israeli occupation enforces a total siege—by land, sea, and air—deliberately cutting off Gaza from the outside world. Land routes are either fully blocked or subject to strict control by the Israeli Occupation Forces and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Aid is often delayed, restricted, or turned into deadly traps. By sea, we bypass these systems and confront the blockade head-on. These boats don't just carry aid; they carry a message: the siege must end.

There are risks. But the greater danger lies in allowing Israel and its allies to carry out genocide with impunity. Israel has a documented history of using force against humanitarian flotillas. However, international attention shifts the calculus. With global coordination, legal preparation, and trained crews, we aim to raise the political cost of any aggression. Participants will undergo vetting, nonviolence training, and safety preparation. The risks we face are small compared to what Palestinians endure every day—starvation, displacement, and bombardment.

Mostly small to mid-size vessels—like the Madleen—that are legally viable, agile, and harder to obstruct. Each boat is overseen by a regional delegation with legal, nautical, and logistical support from the flotilla coalition.

Yes. You can apply as a participant in a boat delegation, apply as crew if you have maritime experience, donate to support boats and aid, join ground teams to organize actions and amplify the mission, or coordinate a solidarity action in your city or port. Every hand counts, whether you're at sea or on shore.

Yes, this action is legal under international law. The Israeli occupation's blockade of Gaza constitutes collective punishment, a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Civilian vessels carrying humanitarian aid or engaging in peaceful protest in international waters are protected under maritime law.

Large ships are expensive, more vulnerable to bureaucratic pressure, and slow to deploy. Our decentralized model—with hundreds of small boats—builds resilience, distributes responsibility, and amplifies grassroots leadership. If a large vessel becomes available and aligns with our mission, it may join. But our strength is in scale, speed, and strategy.
