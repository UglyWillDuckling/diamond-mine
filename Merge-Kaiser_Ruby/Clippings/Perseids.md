The **Perseids** are a prolific [meteor shower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_shower "Meteor shower") associated with the [comet Swift–Tuttle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle "Comet Swift–Tuttle") that are usually visible from mid- [July](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July "July") to late- [August](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August "August"). The [meteors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid") are called the Perseids because they appear from the general direction of the [constellation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation") [Perseus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_\(constellation\) "Perseus (constellation)") and in more modern times have a [radiant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_\(meteor_shower\) "Radiant (meteor shower)") bordering on [Cassiopeia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_\(constellation\) "Cassiopeia (constellation)") and [Camelopardalis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelopardalis "Camelopardalis").

The name is derived from the word [Perseids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids_\(mythology\) "Perseids (mythology)") ([Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Περσείδαι), the sons of [Perseus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus "Perseus") in [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology").

A meteoroid of the Perseids with a size of about ten millimetres entering the Earth's atmosphere in slow motion (x 0.1). The meteoroid is at the bright head of the trail, and the recombination glow of the ionised mesosphere is still visible for about 0.7 seconds in the tail. ( Variant of the animation in real time )

The stream of debris is called the Perseid cloud and stretches along the [orbit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") of the comet [Swift–Tuttle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle "Swift–Tuttle"). The cloud consists of particles ejected by the comet as it travels on its 133-year orbit.[^6] Most of the particles have been part of the cloud for around a thousand years. However, there is also a relatively young filament of dust in the stream that was pulled off the comet in 1865, which can give an early mini-peak the day before the maximum shower.[^7] The dimensions of the cloud in the vicinity of the Earth are estimated to be approximately 0.1 [astronomical units](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_units "Astronomical units") (AU) across and 0.8 AU along the Earth's orbit, spread out by annual interactions with the Earth's gravity.[^8]

The shower is visible from mid-July each year, with the peak in activity between 9 and 14 August, depending on the particular location of the stream. During the peak, the rate of meteors reaches 60 or more per hour. They can be seen all across the sky; however, because of the shower's radiant in the constellation of Perseus, the Perseids are primarily visible in the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere").[^9] As with many meteor showers the visible rate is greatest in the pre-dawn hours, since more meteoroids are scooped up by the side of the Earth moving forward into the stream, corresponding to local times between midnight and noon, as can be seen in the accompanying diagram.[^10] While many meteors arrive between dawn and noon, they are usually not visible due to daylight. Some can also be seen before midnight, often [grazing the Earth's atmosphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-grazing_fireball "Earth-grazing fireball") to produce long bright trails and sometimes fireballs. Most Perseids burn up in the atmosphere while at heights above 80 kilometres (50 mi).[^11]

A Perseid in 2007

Some [Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism") refer to the Perseids as the "tears of [Saint Lawrence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Rome "Lawrence of Rome") ", suspended in the sky but returning to Earth once a year on August 10, the canonical date of that saint's martyrdom in 258 AD.[^36] The [saint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint "Saint") is said to have been burned alive on a gridiron. His manner of death is almost certainly the origin of the Mediterranean [folk legend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_legend "Folk legend") claiming that the shooting stars are the sparks of Saint Lawrence's [martyrdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrdom "Martyrdom"). The legend holds that during the night of August 9 to 10, cooled embers appear in the ground under plants; these embers are known as the "coal of Saint Lawrence." [^37] [^38]

The transition in favor of the Catholic saint and his feast day on August 10, moving away from pagan gods and their festivals — a process known as [Christianization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_saints_and_feasts "Christianization of saints and feasts") — was facilitated by the phonetic assonance of the Latin name Laurentius with [Acca Larentia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acca_Larentia "Acca Larentia"),[^39] a goddess previously celebrated during the summer period alongside [Priapus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priapus "Priapus"), as a fertility deity. Among the Romans, it was believed that the trails of the Perseids represented the benevolent rain of Priapus' seed.[^40] In this context, the god's [cosmogonic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogonic "Cosmogonic") phallus acted as a life-giver, blessing the fields and promoting fertility. During the same period, [phallic processions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallic_processions "Phallic processions") and other sexual rites were common. Christianity, which had a different relationship with sexuality and generativity compared to [Greco-Roman culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome "Sexuality in ancient Rome"), replaced this sexual connotation with a reference to martyrdom.[^41]

In 1836 [Adolphe Quetelet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Quetelet "Adolphe Quetelet") wrote: *J'ai cru remarquer aussi une fréquence plus grande de ces météores au mois d'août (du 8 au 15)* "I think I noticed also a greater frequency of these meteors in the month of August (from 8 to 15)." [^42] After studying historical records, he predicted a peak on 10 August. He then wrote to other astronomers, who confirmed this prediction on the night of 10 August 1837. Quetelet missed the shower due to bad weather.[^43]

In 1866, after the [perihelion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion") passage of Swift-Tuttle in 1862, the Italian astronomer [Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Virginio_Schiaparelli "Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli") discovered the link between meteor showers and comets.[^43] The finding is contained in an exchange of letters with [Angelo Secchi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Secchi "Angelo Secchi").

In his 2006 novel *[Against the Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Day "Against the Day")*, American novelist [Thomas Pynchon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon "Thomas Pynchon") refers to the Perseid meteor shower being watched by three characters west of the Dolores Valley after playing a game of [tarot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot "Tarot"). In the TV series *[Curious George](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curious_George "Curious George")*, season 7 episode 1b, George and his friends Allie and Bill hunt for the Perseids, which they believe are creatures that look like purses. At the end of the episode, Allie's grandfather Mr. Renkins says that the Perseids is a meteor shower happening in early August.[^44]

[John Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Denver "John Denver") 's song " [Rocky Mountain High](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_High "Rocky Mountain High") " references the showers with the lyric, "I've seen it raining fire in the sky."
