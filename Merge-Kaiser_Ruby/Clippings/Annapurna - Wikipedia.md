**Annapurna** ([/ ˌ æ n ə ˈ p ʊər n ə ˌ - ˈ p ɜːr -/](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English");[^5] [^6] [Nepali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language "Nepali language"): अन्नपूर्ण) is a [mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain "Mountain") situated in the [Annapurna mountain range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_\(mountain_range\) "Annapurna (mountain range)") of [Gandaki Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandaki_Province "Gandaki Province"), north-central [Nepal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal "Nepal"). It is the [10th highest mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_mountains_on_Earth "List of highest mountains on Earth") in the world at 8,091 metres (26,545 ft) above sea level and is well known for the difficulty and danger involved in its ascent.

[Maurice Herzog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Herzog "Maurice Herzog") led a [French expedition to its summit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_French_Annapurna_expedition "1950 French Annapurna expedition") through the north face in 1950, making it the first [eight-thousander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-thousander "Eight-thousander") to be successfully climbed.[^7] The entire massif and surrounding area are protected within the 7,629-square-kilometre (2,946 sq mi) [Annapurna Conservation Area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Conservation_Area "Annapurna Conservation Area"), the first and largest conservation area in Nepal. The Annapurna Conservation Area is home to several world-class [treks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_\(wilderness\) "Backpacking (wilderness)"), including [Annapurna Sanctuary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Sanctuary "Annapurna Sanctuary") and [Annapurna Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Circuit "Annapurna Circuit").

For decades, Annapurna I held the highest fatality-to-summit rate of all principal eight-thousander summits; it has, however, seen great climbing successes in recent years, with the fatality rate falling from 32% to under 20% from 2012 to 2022. This figure places it just under the most recent fatality rate estimates for [K2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2 "K2"), at about 24%. The mountain still poses grave threats to climbers through avalanche danger, unpredictable weather and the extremely steep and committing nature of its climbing routes, in particular its 3,000-metre (9,800 ft) south face, renowned as one of the most difficult climbs in the world.[^8] It is also a dangerous peak for trekkers, as in the case of [a 2014 snowstorm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Nepal_snowstorm_disaster "2014 Nepal snowstorm disaster") near it and [Dhaulagiri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaulagiri "Dhaulagiri") which claimed at least 43 lives. As of 2022, 365 people had reached the summit of Annapurna I, while 72 had died in the attempt.

The mountain is named after [Annapurna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_\(goddess\) "Annapurna (goddess)"), the Hindu goddess of food and nourishment, who is said to reside there. The name Annapurna is derived from the [Sanskrit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") -language words *purna* ("filled") and *anna* ("food"), and can be translated as "everlasting food".[^9] Many streams descending from the slopes of the Annapurna Massif provide water for the agricultural fields and pastures located at lower elevations.[^10]

The south face of Annapurna I

Annapurna I was the first 8,000-metre (26,200 ft) peak to be climbed.[^11] [Maurice Herzog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Herzog "Maurice Herzog") and [Louis Lachenal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lachenal "Louis Lachenal"), of the [French Annapurna expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_French_Annapurna_expedition "1950 French Annapurna expedition") led by Herzog (including [Lionel Terray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Terray "Lionel Terray"), [Gaston Rébuffat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_R%C3%A9buffat "Gaston Rébuffat"), [Marcel Ichac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Ichac "Marcel Ichac"), [Jean Couzy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Couzy "Jean Couzy"), Marcel Schatz, Jacques Oudot, Francis de Noyelle), reached the summit on 3 June 1950.[^12] Ichac made a documentary of the expedition, called *Victoire sur l'Annapurna*. Its summit was the [highest one ever attained](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_altitude_record_\(mountaineering\) "World altitude record (mountaineering)") at the time, but not the highest climb; higher non-summit points – at least 8,500 metres (27,900 ft) – had already been attained on [Mount Everest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest "Mount Everest") in the 1920s.

The [south face of Annapurna was first climbed in 1970](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_British_Annapurna_South_Face_expedition "1970 British Annapurna South Face expedition") by [Don Whillans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Whillans "Don Whillans") and [Dougal Haston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougal_Haston "Dougal Haston") also without using supplementary oxygen, members of a [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") expedition led by [Chris Bonington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bonington "Chris Bonington") that included [Ian Clough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Clough "Ian Clough"), who was killed by a falling [serac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serac "Serac") during the descent.[^13] They were, however, beaten to the second ascent of Annapurna by a matter of days by a [British Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army "British Army") expedition whose climbing team was led by then-Captain [Henry Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Day_\(British_Army_officer\) "Henry Day (British Army officer)").[^14]

In 1978, the [American Women's Himalayan Expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Women%27s_Himalayan_Expedition "American Women's Himalayan Expedition"), a team led by [Arlene Blum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Blum "Arlene Blum"), became the first [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") team to climb Annapurna I. The first summit team, composed of [Vera Komarkova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Komarkova "Vera Komarkova") and [Irene Miller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Beardsley "Irene Beardsley"), and [Sherpas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people "Sherpa people") Mingma Tsering and Chewang Ringjing, reached the top at 3:30 pm on 15 October 1978. The second summit team, [Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz "Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz") and [Vera Watson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Watson "Vera Watson"), died during this climb.[^15]

In 1981 Polish expedition Zakopane Alpine Club set a new route on Annapurna I Central (8051 m). [Maciej Berbeka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maciej_Berbeka "Maciej Berbeka") and Bogusław Probulski reached the summit on 23 May 1981. The route called Zakopiańczyków Way was recognized as the best achievement of the Himalayan season in 1981.

On 3 February 1987, [Polish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland") [climbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing "Climbing") [Jerzy Kukuczka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Kukuczka "Jerzy Kukuczka") and [Artur Hajzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_Hajzer "Artur Hajzer") made the first winter ascent of Annapurna I.[^16]

The first solo ascent of the south face was made in October 2007 by Slovenian climber [Tomaž Humar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toma%C5%BE_Humar "Tomaž Humar");[^17] [^18] [^19] [^20] he climbed to the Roc Noir and then to Annapurna East (8,047m).[^21]

On 8 and 9 October 2013 Swiss climber [Ueli Steck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueli_Steck "Ueli Steck") soloed the Lafaille route [^21] on the main and highest part of the face;[^22] this was his third attempt on the route and has been called "one of the most impressive Himalayan climbs in history",[^23] with Steck taking 28 hours to make the trip from Base Camp to summit and back again.[^24] There are significant doubts about this claim.[^25]

Along with K2 and [Nanga Parbat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanga_Parbat "Nanga Parbat"), Annapurna I has consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous of the principal eight-thousander summits. Climbers killed on the peak include Britons [Ian Clough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Clough "Ian Clough") in 1970,[^13] and [Alex MacIntyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_MacIntyre "Alex MacIntyre") in 1982, Frenchman Pierre Béghin in 1992,[^26] Kazakh [Anatoli Boukreev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Boukreev "Anatoli Boukreev") in 1997, Spaniard [Iñaki Ochoa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C3%B1aki_Ochoa_de_Olza "Iñaki Ochoa de Olza") in 2008,[^27] Korean [Park Young-seok](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Young-seok "Park Young-seok") in 2011 [^28] and the Finn [Samuli Mansikka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuli_Mansikka "Samuli Mansikka") in 2015.[^29]
