**The Mbari Club** was a centre for cultural activity by African writers, artists and musicians that was founded in [Ibadan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadan "Ibadan"), [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria"), in 1961 by [Ulli Beier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulli_Beier "Ulli Beier"), with the involvement of a group of young writers including [Wole Soyinka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wole_Soyinka "Wole Soyinka") and [Chinua Achebe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe "Chinua Achebe").[^telegraph-1][^britannica-2] *[Mbari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbari_\(art\) "Mbari (art)")*, an [Igbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language "Igbo language") concept related to "creation", was suggested as the name by Achebe.[^britannica-2] Among other Mbari members were [Christopher Okigbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Okigbo "Christopher Okigbo"), [J. P. Clark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Clark "J. P. Clark") and South African writer [Ezekiel Mphahlele](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Mphahlele "Ezekiel Mphahlele"), [Amos Tutuola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tutuola "Amos Tutuola"), Frances Ademola, [Demas Nwoko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demas_Nwoko "Demas Nwoko"), [Mabel Segun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabel_Segun "Mabel Segun"), [Uche Okeke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uche_Okeke "Uche Okeke"),[^3] [Arthur Nortje](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Nortje "Arthur Nortje") and [Bruce Onobrakpeya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Onobrakpeya "Bruce Onobrakpeya").[^columbia-4]

*[The Daily Telegraph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")* in an obituary of Beier noted that "the Mbari Club became synonymous with the optimism and creative exuberance of Africa’s post-independence era. [Fela Kuti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti "Fela Kuti") made his debut as bandleader there, and it became a magnet for artists and writers from all over Africa, America, and the Caribbean."[^telegraph-1] In the words of Toyin Adepoju: "Coming to birth in the flux of the pre-independence and immediate postindependence period in Nigeria, it brought together a constellation of artists whose work embodied the quality of transformation embodied by the aesthetic of creation, decay, and regeneration evoked by the Mbari tradition."[^adepoju-5]

Closely connected with the literary magazine *[Black Orpheus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Orpheus_\(magazine\) "Black Orpheus (magazine)")*, which Beier had founded in 1957, Mbari also acted as a publisher during the 1960s — considered to be the only African-based publisher of African literature at the time — producing 17 titles by African writers.[^6] Mbari published early works by Clark, Okigbo and Soyinka, poetry by [Bakare Gbadamosi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakare_Gbadamosi "Bakare Gbadamosi") (*Okiri*, 1961), [Alex La Guma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_La_Guma "Alex La Guma") (*A Walk in the Night and Other Stories*, 1962), [Dennis Brutus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Brutus "Dennis Brutus") (*Sirens, Knuckles, Boots*, 1963), [Kofi Awoonor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Awoonor "Kofi Awoonor") and [Lenrie Peters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenrie_Peters "Lenrie Peters"),[^columbia-4] as well as translations of francophone poetry.[^7] Brutus was chosen as winner of the Mbari Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.[^8][^9]

Founded in 1961 by a diverse group of writers, visual artists, musicians, and actors, and active throughout the 1960s, the Mbari Club was originally located in Ibadan's Dugbe Market, on the site of an old Lebanese restaurant that was converted into an open-air performance venue, an art gallery, a library, and an office.[^telegraph-1]

While celebrating the creativity of Nigerian talent in the [newly independent nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nigeria#Independence "History of Nigeria"), Mbari "was an international environment, attracting artists from across Africa and beyond".[^10] The premieres of Soyinka's *The Trials of Brother Jero* and Clark's *Song of a Goat* were staged at Mbari, and internationally renowned artists were also invited to play or exhibit their work, including [Langston Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes "Langston Hughes"), [Jacob Lawrence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lawrence "Jacob Lawrence") and [Pete Seeger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger "Pete Seeger").[^columbia-4] The club also initiated writing competitions.[^adepoju-5]

As recalled by [Lindsay Barrett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Barrett "Lindsay Barrett"), secretary of the Mbari Club from 1966 to 1967: "We were in a historic, literary setting ... when [the civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War "Nigerian Civil War") \[1967–70\] broke out and disintegrated everything."[^11]

In 1962 a similar club based on the same concepts, called **Mbari Mbayo** (the name this time reflecting a [Yoruba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language "Yoruba language") phrase meaning: "Were I to see, I would rejoice" or "When we see it, we shall be happy"),[^britannica-2][^columbia-4] was developed in [Oshogbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshogbo "Oshogbo") — about 50 miles northeast of Ibadan — by dramatist [Duro Ladipo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duro_Ladipo "Duro Ladipo") together with Beier and Mphahlele.[^12] Ladipo converted his father's house into an art gallery and a theatre, where he produced his plays.[^britannica-2] Artists who emerged from the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oshogbo include [Twins Seven Seven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twins_Seven_Seven "Twins Seven Seven"), [Jimoh Buraimoh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimoh_Buraimoh "Jimoh Buraimoh") and [Muraina Oyelami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muraina_Oyelami "Muraina Oyelami").[^13][^britannica-2]

The Mbari-Enugu Club of Eastern Nigeria was established in 1963 and like Mbari Mbayo was particularly a platform for sculpture, painting and literary performance.[^14]
