***Naqoyqatsi*** [^1] is a 2002 American [non-narrative film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-narrative_film "Non-narrative film") directed by [Godfrey Reggio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Reggio "Godfrey Reggio") and edited by [Jon Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kane "Jon Kane"), with music composed by [Philip Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass "Philip Glass"). It is the third and final installment in the [*Qatsi* trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatsi_trilogy "Qatsi trilogy").

The title comes from the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_language "Hopi language") word *[naqö̀yqatsi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/naq%C3%B6%CC%80yqatsi "wikt:naqö̀yqatsi")* meaning "life of war". In the film's closing credits, the title is also translated as "civilized violence" and "a life of killing each other".[^6]

## Synopsis

According to Reggio, the film has no screenplay per se, but three movements (like [those of a symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_\(music\) "Movement (music)")) with different themes:[^7]

1. **Numerica.com:** Language and place gives way to numerical code and virtual reality.
2. **Circus maximus:** Competition, winning, records, fame, “fair play” and the love of money are elevated to the prime values of life. Life becomes a game.
3. **Rocketship twentieth century:** A world that language can no longer describe. The resulting explosive tempo of technology is war and civilized violence.

## Production

The [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks") against the [World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_\(1973%E2%80%932001\) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)") took place very close to the film's production studio, impacting the content of the film and further convincing the crew of the importance of its subject.[^7]

While *[Koyaanisqatsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi "Koyaanisqatsi")* and *[Powaqqatsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powaqqatsi "Powaqqatsi")* examine modern life in industrial countries and the conflict between encroaching industrialization and traditional ways of life, using slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and natural landscapes, about eighty percent of *Naqoyqatsi* uses archive footage and stock images manipulated and processed digitally on [non-linear editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing "Non-linear editing") (non-sequential) [workstations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation "Workstation") and intercut with specially-produced [computer-generated imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery "Computer-generated imagery") to demonstrate society's transition from a natural environment to a technology-based one. Reggio described the process as " [virtual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality") cinema".[^7]

## Music

The music is more in the traditional [orchestral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra "Orchestra") tradition than much of Glass's work as a familiar doorway to images so disconnected from the familiar world. One [instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument "Musical instrument"), the [cello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello "Cello") played by [Yo-Yo Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-Yo_Ma "Yo-Yo Ma"), plays through much of the piece. Some non-orchestral instruments are used in addition to traditional ones, including a [didgeridoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo "Didgeridoo") and an [electronically-created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") [jaw harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew%27s_harp "Jew's harp").[^7]

Soundtrack.net reviewer Glenn McClanan noted that unlike the previous two films, the music is more on the softer side.[^8]
