This article is about the 2024 Atlantic hurricane. For other storms of the same name, see [List of storms named Helene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_storms_named_Helene "List of storms named Helene").

**Hurricane Helene** ( [*heh-LEEN*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"))[^1] was a devastating [tropical cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") that caused widespread catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the [Southeastern United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States "Southeastern United States") in late September **2024**. It was the strongest hurricane on record to strike the [Big Bend region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_\(Florida\) "Big Bend (Florida)") of [Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"), the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since [Maria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria "Hurricane Maria") in [2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season "2017 Atlantic hurricane season"), and the deadliest to strike the [mainland U.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_United_States "Continental United States") since [Katrina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") in [2005](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season "2005 Atlantic hurricane season").[^helene180-2][^ycc-3]

The eighth [named storm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_naming "Tropical cyclone naming"), fifth [hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane "Atlantic hurricane"), and second [major hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Categories "Saffir–Simpson scale") of the [2024 Atlantic hurricane season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Atlantic_hurricane_season "2024 Atlantic hurricane season"), Helene began forming on September 22 as a broad low-pressure system in the western [Caribbean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea "Caribbean Sea").[^beginning-4] By September 24, the disturbance had consolidated enough to become a tropical storm as it approached the [Yucatán Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula "Yucatán Peninsula"), receiving the name *Helene* from the [National Hurricane Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center "National Hurricane Center"). Weather conditions led to the cyclone's intensification, and it became a hurricane early on September 25. More pronounced and [rapid intensification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification "Rapid intensification") ensued as Helene traversed the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") the following day, reaching Category 4 intensity on the evening of September 26. Late on September 26, Helene made [landfall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall "Landfall") at peak intensity in the Big Bend region of Florida, near the city of [Perry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry,_Florida "Perry, Florida"), with [maximum sustained winds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind "Maximum sustained wind") of 140 mph (220 km/h). Helene weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating to a [post-tropical cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-tropical_cyclone "Post-tropical cyclone") over [Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee "Tennessee") on September 27. The storm then stalled over the state before dissipating on September 29.

In advance of Helene's landfall, [states of emergency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency "State of emergency") were declared in [Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida") and [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(U.S._state\) "Georgia (U.S. state)") due to the significant impacts expected, including very high [storm surge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge "Storm surge") along the coast and hurricane-force gusts as far inland as [Atlanta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"). [Hurricane warnings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches") also extended further inland due to Helene's fast motion. The storm caused catastrophic rainfall-triggered [flooding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding "Flooding"), particularly in [western North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_North_Carolina "Western North Carolina"), [East Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Tennessee "East Tennessee"), and [southwestern Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Virginia "Southwest Virginia"), and spawned numerous [tornadoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"). Helene also inundated [Tampa Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay "Tampa Bay"), breaking [storm surge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge "Storm surge") records throughout the area. As of January 7, 2025, at least 219 deaths and $78.7 billion in damage have been attributed to the storm.[^5]

## Meteorological history

On September 17, the [National Hurricane Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center "National Hurricane Center") (NHC) highlighted the potential for [tropical cyclogenesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis "Tropical cyclogenesis") in the western Caribbean Sea.[^6] Conditions conducive for development of a tropical cyclone resulted from the interaction of the [Central American gyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_gyre "Central American gyre")—a broad monsoon low pressure system—and the [Madden–Julian Oscillation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden%E2%80%93Julian_Oscillation "Madden–Julian Oscillation"), which reinforced the large-scale cyclonic flow extending from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the western Caribbean Sea.[^7] Several days later, on September 22, a broad low-pressure area developed within the western Caribbean.[^beginning-4] As the system traversed an environment conducive for tropical cyclone development,[^8] showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance gradually consolidated.[^9] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated [Potential Tropical Cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tropical_cyclone_terms#P "Glossary of tropical cyclone terms") *Nine* on September 23.[^10] The next day, [Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/53rd_Weather_Reconnaissance_Squadron "53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron") aircraft found that the system was producing flight-level winds of 52 mph (84 km/h) and had developed a better-defined center; the NHC accordingly upgraded the system to Tropical Storm *Helene* at 15:00 UTC. The system continued strengthening, with [NOAA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration") and Air Force Reserve [Hurricane Hunters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters "Hurricane hunters") finding that Helene's maximum winds had increased to 80 mph (130 km/h). As a result, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on September 25, as it entered the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") while turning north. An [upper-level trough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_\(meteorology\) "Trough (meteorology)") to its west and a ridge of [high pressure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_area "High-pressure area") located off the Southeastern United States both served to steer the cyclone towards the [U.S. Gulf Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Gulf_Coast "U.S. Gulf Coast").[^12] Helene was a very large system,[^13] with the NHC noting in multiple forecast discussions that the forecast storm radii were "at the 90th percentile of hurricane size at similar latitudes".

After remaining steady in intensity for a while due to its broad size and some [entrainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_\(meteorology\) "Entrainment (meteorology)") of drier air to its west, Helene recovered quickly and began its [rapid intensification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification "Rapid intensification") early on the morning of September 26 – aided by low mid-level [wind shear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear "Wind shear"), high [relative humidity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity#Relative_humidity "Humidity") values and [sea surface temperatures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature "Sea surface temperature") (SSTs) exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) near the [Loop Current](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_Current "Loop Current") — as an increasingly defined [eye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_\(cyclone\) "Eye (cyclone)") developed, reaching Category 2 intensity at 12:00 UTC.[^14] Quickly strengthening, by 18:25 UTC Helene was found to have become a [major hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Categories "Saffir–Simpson scale") by Hurricane Hunters,[^15] and four hours later, a Category 4 hurricane.[^16] The hurricane attained its peak intensity later that night with [maximum sustained wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind "Maximum sustained wind") of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 938 millibars (27.70 inHg) at 3:10 UTC on September 27 as it made landfall east of the center of the [Aucilla River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aucilla_River "Aucilla River") about 10 miles (16 km) west-southwest of [Perry, Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry,_Florida "Perry, Florida"),[^17] becoming the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's [Big Bend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_\(Florida\) "Big Bend (Florida)") region.[^weather_channel_storm's_inland_trek-18] Rapid weakening occurred as the storm tracked inland, and by the time it reached Georgia at 05:00 UTC the next day, it had weakened into a Category 2 hurricane.[^19] Weakening further, it became a tropical storm over east central Georgia a few hours later.[^20] After a few hours, it weakened and became a tropical depression near the Kentucky-Tennessee border, northeast of [Cookeville, Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookeville,_Tennessee "Cookeville, Tennessee").[^21] It rapidly became a [post-tropical cyclone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-tropical_cyclone "Post-tropical cyclone") and eventually dissipated on September 29.

On October 9, researchers with [World Weather Attribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Weather_Attribution "World Weather Attribution") concluded with "high confidence" that Helene was made worse by [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"). In a scientific assessment, researchers found that Helene had 10% more rain, had winds that were 13 miles per hour more intense, and drew energy from water that was 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer due to climate change.[^22]<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="Relative to what? (October 2024)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This "13 miles per hour" means that the wind speed increased by 11% and as the destruction from hurricanes grew by 50% when the wind speed increased by 5%, [climate change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") increased the destruction from the hurricane by more than twice. Researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that in some parts of Georgia and North Carolina climate change increased the rainfall from the storm by more than 50%.[^23]

## Preparations

## Impact

### Honduras

[Honduras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras") experienced heavy rains as a result of the [Central American gyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_gyre "Central American gyre") which preceded Helene.[^99] As a result, the [Goascorán River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goascor%C3%A1n_River "Goascorán River") brought flooding to nearby communities located in low-lying areas through [Valle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_Department "Valle Department") and [Choluteca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choluteca_Department "Choluteca Department") departments, reaching a level over .48 feet (0.15 m).[^heraldo_floods-100] A state of emergency was issued in [San Marcos de Colón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos_de_Col%C3%B3n "San Marcos de Colón"), Choluteca, due to overall damage caused by the storm.[^101] Nearly 30 homes were estimated to be affected in El Cubulero, [Alianza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alianza,_Honduras "Alianza, Honduras"), Valle. Due to high waves onshore, 120 families were affected in the coastal town of [Marcovia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcovia "Marcovia"), Choluteca; at least one home was destroyed. Heavy rainfall left communities isolated and 50 people sheltered in [El Paraíso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Para%C3%ADso_Department "El Paraíso Department") due to severe floods.[^heraldo_floods-100]

### Mexico

#### Cayman Islands

Over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain fell onto the Cayman Islands.[^108] Heavy rainfall and large waves began affecting the Cayman Islands on September 24.[^109] Roads in [George Town](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town,_Cayman_Islands "George Town, Cayman Islands") were flooded as rainfall produced by the storm caused 14 power outages, affecting 118 customers across Grand Cayman.[^caymancompass-34] The government began planning to buy land to aid in storm water management.[^110] After Helene had passed, Grand Cayman was impacted by 5–7 foot (1.5–2.1 m) waves on September 26.[^111]

#### Cuba

In Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, with peak accumulations of 218.4 mm (8.60 in) recorded in Presa Herradura and 186.8 mm (7.35 in) in [Palacios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Palacios "Los Palacios").[^cibercuba-112] Elsewhere, [Punta del Este](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_del_Este "Punta del Este") and [Isla de la Juventud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_de_la_Juventud "Isla de la Juventud") received 101 mm (4.0 in), Paso Real de San Diego received 78 mm (3.1 in), [Pinar del Río](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo "Pinar del Río") received 72 mm (2.8 in), and Isabel Rubio received 70 mm (2.8 in).[^113] In [Pinar del Río Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo_Province "Pinar del Río Province"), 17 of the province's 24 reservoirs overflowed. Elsewhere, in El Palenque, road access was cut off due to flooding caused by Helene.[^cibercuba-112] Helene's winds caused a failure in the power lines that feed the Guanito transmitter, causing most of the territory, especially San Juan and Martínez, [Guane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guane "Guane"), [Mantua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua,_Cuba "Mantua, Cuba"), and [Minas de Matahambre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_de_Matahambre "Minas de Matahambre"), to suffer blackouts.[^114] Gale-force winds were recorded in the provinces of [Isla de la Juventud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_de_la_Juventud "Isla de la Juventud") and Pinar del Río.[^115] In total, around 70,000 customers experienced power outages in Pinar del Rio, with another 160,000 residents affected in [Artemisa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisa_Province "Artemisa Province").[^116]

In [Havana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana "Havana"), one person was injured after an uninhabited building collapsed due to heavy rains, and two landslides occurred.[^117] Intense rainfall caused the [Cuyaguateje River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyaguateje_River "Cuyaguateje River") to rise rapidly, causing flooding in parts of Pinar del Río on September 26.[^118][^119] Flooding also occurred in [Mayabeque Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayabeque_Province "Mayabeque Province"), primarily in the municipalities of [Batabanó](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataban%C3%B3,_Cuba "Batabanó, Cuba"), [Melena del Sur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melena_del_Sur "Melena del Sur"), and [San Nicolás de Bari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Bari "San Nicolás de Bari").[^120]

Initial estimates suggested that insured losses could reach US$3–6 billion, according to reinsurance broker Gallagher Re;[^140] [AM Best](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_Best "AM Best") estimated losses in excess of US$5 billion.[^141] Later estimates by [Moody's Analytics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody%27s_Analytics "Moody's Analytics") estimated that the damage could reach US$20–34 billion.[^142] [AccuWeather](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccuWeather "AccuWeather") estimated that the total damage and economic loss could cost anywhere from US$225–250 billion.[^143] At least four million people have lost power, according to the Omaha Public Power District.[^oppd-144] Agricultural damage is estimated at US$7 billion.[^145] Insured losses are expected to be lower than initially estimated due to standard [home insurance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_insurance "Home insurance") [policies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_policy "Insurance policy") not including [flood insurance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_insurance "Flood insurance") coverage, increased coverage restrictions by insurers, and hurricane [deductibles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible "Deductible").[^146][^147]

On September 27, [Delta Air Lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines "Delta Air Lines") at [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield-Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport "Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport") issued travel waivers to people impacted by flight cancellations or delays. They also anticipated that there would be travel disruptions due to the force of Hurricane Helene making it dangerous for airplanes to fly.

[Appalachian State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_State_University "Appalachian State University")'s football game against [Liberty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University "Liberty University") was canceled due to flooding and was not rescheduled.[^232] A mudslide and floodwaters from the [Pigeon River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_River_\(Tennessee%E2%80%93North_Carolina\) "Pigeon River (Tennessee–North Carolina)") washed out a section of [I-40](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_40 "Interstate 40") at the North Carolina–Tennessee border, forcing another closure.[^233] The Pigeon River rose to more than 25 feet (7.6 metres) in [Canton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_North_Carolina "Canton, North Carolina"),[^oehrli-219] higher than during [Hurricane Frances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Frances "Hurricane Frances") in 2004 and [Tropical Storm Fred](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Fred_\(2021\) "Tropical Storm Fred (2021)") in 2021.[^234] In [Busick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busick,_North_Carolina "Busick, North Carolina"), rainfall totals reached 30.78 in (782 mm).[^235] The [University of North Carolina at Asheville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Asheville "University of North Carolina at Asheville") canceled all classes through October 9 (later extended through October 28), along with Appalachian State campuses of Boone and [Hickory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickory,_North_Carolina "Hickory, North Carolina") through October 11, and [Western Carolina University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Carolina_University "Western Carolina University") through October 4.[^236] [Warren Wilson College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Wilson_College "Warren Wilson College") and [Blue Ridge Community College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Community_College_\(North_Carolina\) "Blue Ridge Community College (North Carolina)") announced they would remain closed for at least a week.[^inside-237] The [Asheville School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheville_School "Asheville School"), a boarding school in Asheville, evacuated its students and announced the campus would remain closed until October 14.[^238] [Christ School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_School_\(North_Carolina\) "Christ School (North Carolina)"), an all-boys Episcopal boarding school in [Arden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden,_North_Carolina "Arden, North Carolina"), was not evacuated and the campus was left without power until October 9. Classes would resume six days later.[^239][^240]

The [North Carolina Department of Transportation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Department_of_Transportation "North Carolina Department of Transportation") (NCDOT) issued a statement on their website that all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed.[^241] [Lees-McRae College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lees-McRae_College "Lees-McRae College") in [Banner Elk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_Elk,_North_Carolina "Banner Elk, North Carolina") evacuated their campus and as of September 29, all students were successfully evacuated with the assistance of the [North Carolina National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_National_Guard "North Carolina National Guard").[^inside-237]

There were various non-specific online posts using antisemitic rhetoric and threatening violence against FEMA officials in the aftermath of the storm.[^242][^wposthelene-243] In one instance, federal aid workers briefly paused or relocated their work in [Rutherford County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_County,_North_Carolina "Rutherford County, North Carolina"), North Carolina, as a result.[^244] A 44-year-old North Carolina man was later arrested and charged in the Rutherford County incident after he was found with a handgun and a rifle at a supermarket serving as a storm relief site.[^245]

The catastrophic flooding and destruction caused by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina likely caused at least a record US$59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.[^246] The storm and its aftermath caused 1,400 landslides and damaged over 160 water and sewer systems, at least 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) of roads, more than 1,000 bridges and culverts and an estimated 126,000 homes, the budget office said. Some 220,000 households are expected to apply for federal assistance.[^247]

[Clemson University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_University "Clemson University") faced major online backlash[^255] after deciding to host its September 28 homecoming football game against [Stanford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University"), bringing 80,295 fans to campus, most of whom were non-locals, at a time when the surrounding upstate, including the nearby city of [Clemson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson,_South_Carolina "Clemson, South Carolina") and town of [Central](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central,_South_Carolina "Central, South Carolina"), were facing widespread power outages and gas shortages.[^256][^257] Tailgaters put a heavy strain on already scarce supplies such as gas, hot food from the few local restaurants that remained open, and ice that residents needed to prevent their food from spoiling in the absence of power. Later, on September 28, Clemson University announced that it would be opening some of its powered facilities and offering free food, drinks, ice, charging stations, and showers to the community for members in need of respite following the storm. However, many criticized the university for not doing so sooner.[^258] Criticism continued when Clemson University announced that classes would be canceled on Monday, September 30, seemingly contradicting the earlier assertion that the area was recovered well enough to host a game.[^259]

An electrical power outage led to one South Carolina factory farm losing 45,000 chickens. Millions more likely died due to Helene's effects across the Southeast, where almost half of the chicken farmed for meat in the United States is produced.[^vox_oct1-203]

Helicopter crews rescued 58 people, with units from the [Virginia State Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_State_Police "Virginia State Police") assisting, from [Unicoi County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicoi_County,_Tennessee "Unicoi County, Tennessee") Hospital in [Erwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin,_Tennessee "Erwin, Tennessee") after the hospital was almost entirely submerged.[^260] Part of a set of bridges on [US 23/I-26](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_23_in_Tennessee "U.S. Route 23 in Tennessee")/[US 19W](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_19W "U.S. Route 19W") spanning the [Nolichucky River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolichucky_River "Nolichucky River") in Erwin were completely washed away.[^261][^262] The [Nashville Predators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators "Nashville Predators") postponed a preseason game against the [Tampa Bay Lightning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning "Tampa Bay Lightning") to October 7 due to severe weather in the area.[^263] [Nashville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee "Nashville, Tennessee") broke a daily rainfall record on September 27.[^264] In [Morristown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morristown,_Tennessee "Morristown, Tennessee"), several trees fell, causing power lines to be snapped throughout the city.[^265] Wind gusts in [Sparta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta,_Tennessee "Sparta, Tennessee") reached 44 mph (71 km/h).[^266] In [Newport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Tennessee "Newport, Tennessee"), the [Pigeon River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_River_\(Tennessee%E2%80%93North_Carolina\) "Pigeon River (Tennessee–North Carolina)") rose to over three times the flood stage and set a new record at 26 feet (7.9 m), flooding portions of the town and nearby [I-40](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_40_in_Tennessee "Interstate 40 in Tennessee").[^267] As of October 1, 2024, across northeastern Tennessee, 85 people were still missing.[^helene160-268]

Early on September 28, the [Tennessee Valley Authority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority "Tennessee Valley Authority") (TVA) utility company issued a Condition Red alert for the [Nolichucky Dam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolichucky_Dam "Nolichucky Dam"), saying that a failure of the dam was imminent, and local authorities issued an evacuation order.[^269] However, it was reported by late morning the same day that water levels along the [Nolichucky River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolichucky_River "Nolichucky River") were lowering. The TVA was investigating the dam to figure out the next steps.[^270] 12 mi (19 km) northeast of the Nolichucky Dam, the Kinser Bridge, which is a part of [SR 107](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_State_Route_107 "Tennessee State Route 107"), usually 60 ft (18 m) above the Nolichucky River, collapsed after floodwaters overran the bridge.[^271] A total of five state-maintained bridges were destroyed.[^272] A [K-9](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog "Police dog") for the Erwin Police Department named Scotty was found dead on September 28 after going missing during flooding in the [Bumpus Cove](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumpus_Cove,_Tennessee "Bumpus Cove, Tennessee") community.[^273] Six employees who were trapped by flood waters at the Impact Plastics plant in Erwin were among the missing and dead, with one worker who survived and family members of the deceased saying workers were not told that they could leave until after flood waters had covered the road to the plant and it lost power. Impact Plastics released a statement expressing sympathy for the workers' deaths and said that employees had not been threatened with termination for leaving the plant.[^274][^275][^276] The incident is under investigation by the [Tennessee Bureau of Investigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Bureau_of_Investigation "Tennessee Bureau of Investigation").[^277]

Following the storm, four state parks fully closed, with [Panther Creek State Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_Creek_State_Park "Panther Creek State Park") experiencing trail closures and [Seven Islands State Birding Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Islands_State_Birding_Park "Seven Islands State Birding Park") having both trail and boat ramp closures.[^278] Hurricane Helene caused a total agricultural and forestry loss of $1.351 billion.[^:2-135]

Over 70 water rescue operations occurred in the state, with the [Virginia National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_National_Guard "Virginia National Guard") rappelling from helicopters and pulling people from cars. In [Albemarle County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albemarle_County,_Virginia "Albemarle County, Virginia"), one road was washed out. Elsewhere, [SR 670](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_State_Route_670 "Virginia State Route 670") in [Madison County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Virginia "Madison County, Virginia") and [SR 637](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_State_Route_637 "Virginia State Route 637") in [Greene County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_Virginia "Greene County, Virginia") suffered heavy damage. [Claytor Lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytor_Lake "Claytor Lake") would suffer heavy pollution, with officials noting that their teams had found propane tanks and floating cars behind the dam.[^vm930-282] In [Pulaski County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulaski_County,_Virginia "Pulaski County, Virginia"), initial estimates revealed that 45 homes were significantly impacted. At the same time, in [Giles County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_County,_Virginia "Giles County, Virginia"), more than 35 buildings were destroyed. Most of [US 21](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_21_in_Virginia "U.S. Route 21 in Virginia") along the mountainside outside of [Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence,_Virginia "Independence, Virginia") in [Grayson County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Virginia "Grayson County, Virginia") was destroyed, while [US 58](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_58 "U.S. Route 58") and [Virginia Creeper Trail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Creeper_Trail "Virginia Creeper Trail") were wiped out and will need to be rebuilt headed into Damascus. Access to [Taylors Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylors_Valley,_Virginia "Taylors Valley, Virginia") in [Washington County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_Virginia "Washington County, Virginia") was cut off after the two bridges into the community were destroyed.[^283] In the city of [Radford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radford,_Virginia "Radford, Virginia"), the [New River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_River,_Virginia "New River, Virginia") crested at 31.03 ft (9.46 m), only being surpassed by a 35.96 ft (10.96 m) crest on August 14, 1940, due to the remnants of the [1940 South Carolina hurricane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_South_Carolina_hurricane "1940 South Carolina hurricane"). An EF1 tornado caused minor damage in [Bedford County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_County,_Virginia "Bedford County, Virginia"), while an EF2 tornado in [Pittsylvania County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsylvania_County,_Virginia "Pittsylvania County, Virginia") injured one person, damaged 30 structures, and destroyed a mobile home.[^284] Another EF1 tornado blew down trees near [Keeling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling,_Virginia "Keeling, Virginia") as well.[^dat-195] Power outages in the state affected 190,000 people.[^285]

Following the storm, nine state parks and four preserves closed due to damage from Helene.[^286] In addition, numerous trails were closed in [Shenandoah National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenandoah_National_Park "Shenandoah National Park").[^287] The entire [Blue Ridge Parkway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway "Blue Ridge Parkway") was closed as well, though much of the Virginia segment of the highway re-opened on October 11.[^288] Virginia suffered $4.1 billion in agricultural damage and [mitigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigation "Mitigation"), this made Helene the costliest tropical cyclone in Virginian history.[^289]

#### Elsewhere

[LaRue County, Kentucky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaRue_County,_Kentucky "LaRue County, Kentucky"), experienced up to 3.61 in (92 mm) of rain.[^290] A daily rainfall record was broken in [Lexington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky "Lexington, Kentucky"). Wind gusts in [Morgan County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_Kentucky "Morgan County, Kentucky") exceeded 60 mph (97 km/h).

In West Virginia, heavy rainfall occurred. High water ran in [Bluefield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluefield,_West_Virginia "Bluefield, West Virginia"), and trees blocked multiple roadways. Elsewhere in the state were fallen trees across parts of [Fayette County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayette_County,_West_Virginia "Fayette County, West Virginia"). In [Mercer County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_West_Virginia "Mercer County, West Virginia"), more than 20,000 customers lost power due to Helene.[^294] The [Denver Broncos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos "Denver Broncos"), who were practicing at the Greenbrier Resort due to having two consecutive east coast road games, were forced to hold one of their practices in the indoor tennis courts due to the heavy rainfall.[^295][^296] Helene's rains have been primarily beneficial, alleviating drought conditions which were in the state since August 2024.[^297] In [Huntington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington,_West_Virginia "Huntington, West Virginia"), a wind gust of 70 mph (110 km/h) was recorded; which was the second highest wind gust ever recorded at that station.[^298]

In Illinois, Helene's remnants produced heavy rains and high winds, causing several thousand outages.[^299] The waves on [Lake Michigan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan "Lake Michigan") were as high as 10 ft (3.0 m).[^300] Portions of [Southern Illinois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois "Southern Illinois") exceeded 6 in (150 mm) of rain from the storm, which caused water levels on the [Ohio River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River "Ohio River") to jump by 15 ft (4.6 m) following the storm. However, the rainfall in this region was largely beneficial due to drought conditions from a lack of rain earlier in the month.[^301] About 100,000 power outages occurred in [Indiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana "Indiana"),[^302] and winds gusted up to 68 mph (109 km/h).[^303] Rainfall in the state peaked at 4.89 in (124 mm) in [Mt. Vernon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Vernon,_Indiana "Mt.

Over 120,000 customers lost power in [Ohio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio "Ohio").[^305] An estimated 1,000 households have sustained damage in [Scioto County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scioto_County,_Ohio "Scioto County, Ohio") due to unexpected heavy rainfall, with 7 in (180 mm) of rain falling within the span of a few hours. 400 damage reports have been filed as of September 30, 2024.[^306] In the city of [Cincinnati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati "Cincinnati"), rainfall totals reached 2.05 in (52 mm).[^307] Wind gusts in the state reached 67 mph (108 km/h).[^308]

In the state of [Alabama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama "Alabama"), over 3,000 customers lost power.[^309] Isolated regions in [Geneva County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_County,_Alabama "Geneva County, Alabama") and [Houston County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_County,_Alabama "Houston County, Alabama") experienced 6–8 in (150–200 mm) of rain. However, a last-second shift to the east lessened impacts throughout the state.[^310]

In the [Northeast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States "Northeastern United States"), particularly in [New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_\(state\) "New York (state)") and [New Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey"), light moisture from the northeastern quadrants of Helene's remnants associated with a cold front would precipitate over the [tri-state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-state_area "Tri-state area") area.[^311] Rainfall was overall light with breezy conditions across the region.[^312] Helene's impacts across the region would be the last measured precipitation in that region until November in a historic dry-spell.[^313]

Hurricane Helene was one of the largest-diameter US Gulf Coast hurricanes.[^washpost_20240926-317] Although large size does not mean *strength*—which is based on sustained wind measurements—it may mean that more people are exposed to a storm's hazards.[^washpost_20240926-317]

On September 28, 2024, the [Omaha Public Power District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Public_Power_District "Omaha Public Power District") sent Mutual Aid crews to [West Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia "West Virginia") to help with power restoration after Helene, their third in a disaster in 2024.[^oppd-144] California sent 151 search and rescue members to affected areas.[^318] The [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency "Federal Emergency Management Agency") (FEMA) sent in search-and-rescue teams, bottled water, and [Starlink](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink "Starlink") terminals.[^319] Additionally, an eastern Kentucky [storm chaser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_chasing "Storm chasing") contributed 30 Starlink terminals to storm victims in western North Carolina.[^320] In total SpaceX stated that they had donated approximately 500 terminals through various channels.[^321] The [American Red Cross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross "American Red Cross")[^322] and [The Salvation Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army "The Salvation Army"),[^323] among other [nonprofit organizations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization "Nonprofit organization"), began deploying emergency disaster services teams in many affected areas. A unit from the 1st Battalion of the [169th Aviation Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/169th_Aviation_Regiment_\(United_States\) "169th Aviation Regiment (United States)"), part of the [Connecticut Army National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Military_Department "Connecticut Military Department"), was deployed to North Carolina to help assist disaster relief efforts.[^324] T&T Line Construction of Hornwell, [New Brunswick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick "New Brunswick"), Canada sent 11 line crews to Western North Carolina through its mutual assistance agreement with Duke Energy. “Companies from the US aid us in storms; it’s a mutual thing” said a T&T crew leader. Several crews from [Quebec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec"), Canada were also seen working around [Woodfin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodfin,_North_Carolina "Woodfin, North Carolina") NC.[^325] Duke also used helicopters not only to transport power poles to Henderson County NC but also to set the poles into the ground, a difficult and complex undertaking.[^326] Two other line workers hiked 1.5 miles over very rough ground to bring a power line into the Ashville NC [Veterans’ Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs "United States Department of Veterans Affairs") Medical Center that had gone dark due to the storm.[^327]

Pack mules were utilized to access areas inaccessible by other means in North Carolina.[^328] Operation AirDrop and the Carolina Emergency Response Team helped deploy volunteer private helicopter pilots to assist in rescue efforts.[^329][^330]

As of October 1, the White House reported via press release that FEMA had given out 6.5 million liters of water and 7.1 million meals.[^nbc_news-2024-331][^332] [World Central Kitchen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen "World Central Kitchen") would deploy food trucks to hurricane struck areas, proving more than 64,000 meals in multiple states affected.[^nbc_news-2024-331] The owner of a local [Mellow Mushroom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellow_Mushroom "Mellow Mushroom") would give away $5000 of free pizza to Asheville residents.[^nbc_news-2024-331] On October 9, [Anat Sultan-Dadon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_consuls_general_of_Israel_to_the_United_States "List of consuls general of Israel to the United States") brought emergency supplies to the community of North Augusta, South Carolina.[^333] The international non-profit agency SmartAID also coordinated with communities in North Carolina and Florida to provide limited electricity and communications systems in areas impacted by Helene.[^:1-334]

On October 1, West Virginia Governor [Jim Justice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Justice "Jim Justice") declared a state of emergency in Mercer County which allowed the West Virginia Emergency Management Division to implement the Emergency Operations Plan, allowing swift mobilization of personnel, resources, and essential emergency services. Justice said of the emergency declaration that it "will allow us to speed up the response on the ground and potentially receive federal assistance as we push forward with recovery efforts".[^335]

The [National Football League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League "National Football League") (NFL), in collaboration with the [Atlanta Falcons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons "Atlanta Falcons"), [Carolina Panthers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers "Carolina Panthers"), [Houston Texans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans "Houston Texans"), and [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers "Tampa Bay Buccaneers") via the [NFL Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Foundation "NFL Foundation"), donated $8 million to the relief effort.[^336] The quarterbacks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, [Baker Mayfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield "Baker Mayfield"), and the Atlanta Falcons, [Kirk Cousins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins "Kirk Cousins"), both donated $50,000 as well.[^337] The [Major League Baseball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball "Major League Baseball") (MLB) team, the [New York Yankees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees "New York Yankees"), donated $1.25 million to American Red Cross relief efforts via the New York Yankees Foundation.[^338] The [Tampa Bay Rays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays "Tampa Bay Rays") and their [USL Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USL_Championship "USL Championship") team, the [Tampa Bay Rowdies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rowdies "Tampa Bay Rowdies"), pledged $1 million towards local relief efforts.[^339] The [National Hockey League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League "National Hockey League") (NHL) team, the [Carolina Hurricanes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes "Carolina Hurricanes"), donated their ticket revenue from their game against the [Nashville Predators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators "Nashville Predators") on October 2, totaling $235,000. In addition to the donated ticket revenue, the team held an auction for merchandise and a meet-and-greet with players to raise over $300,000 in total towards relief efforts, while the [Tampa Bay Lightning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning "Tampa Bay Lightning") donated $3 million in collaboration with Ferman Motor Car Company Inc. towards relief efforts.[^340][^341] The [National Basketball Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association "National Basketball Association") (NBA) team, the [Charlotte Hornets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets "Charlotte Hornets"), committed $1 million towards the American Red Cross and the [Second Harvest Food Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_America "Feeding America") of Metrolina.[^342] [Dolly Parton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton "Dolly Parton") announced that she will donate $2 million to relief efforts, $1 million personally and another $1 million through her various businesses and the [Dollywood Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollywood_Foundation "Dollywood Foundation").[^343] [Taylor Swift](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift "Taylor Swift") donated $5 million to [Feeding America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_America "Feeding America")'s relief efforts for Helene and [Hurricane Milton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton "Hurricane Milton"), which impacted Florida less than two weeks after Helene.[^344]

A surge in air traffic over the disaster area occurred due to relief efforts, with an estimated 300% increase in air traffic over western North Carolina alone. The [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") and the North Carolina Department of Transportation's Division of Aviation issued warnings and restrictions to prevent aerial accidents such as issuing temporary flight restrictions for drones, implementing prior permission request lines, creating temporary airspace coordination areas, creating Standard-use Army Aircraft Flight Routes, and deploying temporary air traffic control towers.[^345][^346] The restrictions came in the wake of a report of approximately 30 mid-air close calls over North Carolina on September 28 alone and at least two incidents with private aircraft attempting to drop off supplies, including a plane whose landing gear failed to deploy before landing at [Hickory Regional Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickory_Regional_Airport "Hickory Regional Airport"), causing a temporary closure of the runway, and another which caught fire.[^347][^348]

On October 4, [Elon Musk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk "Elon Musk") claimed on a post on [X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") that FEMA was not allowing [SpaceX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") personnel to deliver Starlink terminals to areas affected by Hurricane Helene and that the air space had been shut down.[^349] Roughly an hour later, [Secretary of Transportation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation "United States Secretary of Transportation") [Pete Buttigieg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg "Pete Buttigieg") responded to Musk on [X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") by rejecting his claims, saying that the "FAA doesn’t block legitimate rescue and recovery flights" and offering to discuss any potential issues over the phone.[^350] Musk then later posted on social media that he'd talked to Buttigieg and thanked him for talking with him and subsequently commented that Buttigieg had resolved the issue.[^351]

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on October 5 requiring debris management sites and landfills located within all counties impacted by Helene to remain open 24/7 until conditions deteriorate in order to help facilitate the quick removal of debris in anticipation of [Hurricane Milton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton "Hurricane Milton") making landfall in the state. The order also increased the number of Florida National Guardsmen working on debris removal from 800 to 4,000 to try and prevent the debris becoming a hazard ahead of Milton's anticipated landfall.[^352][^353]

Milton dumped 16 in (410 mm) of rain on Hillsborough County,[^abc7_cnn-354] following its landfall south of the Tampa Bay area, near [Siesta Key](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta_Key,_Florida "Siesta Key, Florida"), as a Category 3 hurricane on October 9.[^355] Flooding, along with additional damage, adversely affected Helene cleanup efforts in the region.[^abc7_cnn-354] In response, Bay Area nonprofits expanded their relief work.[^356] Also, additional Federal disaster assistance was made available to the state to supplement recovery efforts in the areas affected by Milton.[^abc7_cnn-354]

Florida recorded a rise in cases of [Vibrio vulnificus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_vulnificus "Vibrio vulnificus") (a flesh eating bacteria that favors warm waters and spreads in heavy flood rains) following Hurricane Helene, which Hurricane Milton exacerbated. Prior to Helene, 6 cases had been reported in September; by the end of the month that number had risen to 24. As of October 18, there had been 38 confirmed cases statewide, equaling the total number of cases in 2024 prior the hurricanes.[^357]

### Political response

President Biden was criticized by Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") and other Republican politicians for visiting [Rehoboth Beach, Delaware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware") over the weekend instead of being at the [White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") commanding the federal response.[^358] Biden disputed claims that he was not helping to command the federal response to the disaster and stated that he had been doing so over the phone. Biden also said that he might have to ask [Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") to return to [Washington, D.C.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") to pass supplemental funding for the federal government's response to Helene. Biden promised to visit the emergency operations center in [Raleigh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina "Raleigh, North Carolina") on October 2 before embarking on an aerial tour of Asheville before visiting Georgia and Florida "as soon as possible after that". Democratic party presidential nominee, Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris "Kamala Harris") also promised to be "on the ground" as soon as possible without interrupting emergency response operations. On September 30, Harris boarded [Air Force Two](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Two "Air Force Two") en route to [Joint Base Andrews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Base_Andrews "Joint Base Andrews") to visit FEMA headquarters in Washington, D.C. for a briefing on support for emergency response and recovery efforts from the results of Hurricane Helene.[^359]

In response to reporters' questions about the relation between climate change and the hurricane's severity, the head of FEMA, [Deanne Criswell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanne_Criswell "Deanne Criswell"), said climate change made the storm significantly worse.[^360][^361] Later, when reporters asked President Biden if climate change is to blame for the damage done by the hurricane he answered: "Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes."[^362]

On September 30, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia and alleged that Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, was "having a hard time getting the president \[Joe Biden\] on the phone. Federal government is not being responsive.” Biden responded that Trump was "lying" as Biden said he had spoken to Kemp. The federal government was "doing everything possible", while Kemp said that Biden "just called me yesterday afternoon \[on September 29\] — I missed him and called him right back ... \[Biden\] just said, 'Hey, what do you need?' And I told him, 'You know, we got what we need, we will work through the federal process.' He offered that if there's other things we need, just to call him directly, which, I appreciate that. But we've had FEMA embedded with us since, you know, a day or two before the storm hit."[^363][^364][^365] Trump also claimed without providing evidence on his social media platform, [Truth Social](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social "Truth Social"), that the federal government and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper were "going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas".[^366]

On October 1, the [U.S. senators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia wrote a letter to Senate leadership urging action to help their states, even if it meant returning early from the fall recess.[^nbc_news-2024-331] However, a day later, [Speaker of the House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives") [Mike Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson "Mike Johnson") said that lawmakers would not return early saying that, "We wouldn't even conceivably have the request ready before we get back in November" due to uncertainties about the cost of the disaster and that there was "no necessity" for a return. [Secretary of Homeland Security](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security "United States Secretary of Homeland Security") [Alejandro Mayorkas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas "Alejandro Mayorkas") said that the costly relief effort would use most of FEMA's funding for the year and that the agency would be unprepared for another major disaster.[^:0-367] That same day, Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina [Mark Robinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Robinson_\(American_politician\) "Mark Robinson (American politician)"), tweeted claims that Biden had told reporters that there were "no more supplies" for North Carolinians that were impacted by the storm. When asked for proof of the comment being said, reporters were given a video clip of Biden on September 29 responding to a question about any additional supplies being made available, with Biden stating "no, we have pre-planned a significant amount of \[resources\], even though they hadn’t asked for it yet."[^368]

(From left to right) Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, FEMA director Deanne Criswell, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, and President Joe Biden speak during an aerial tour to survey damage caused by Hurricane Helene aboard [Marine One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_One "Marine One") on October 2, 2024

On October 2, President Biden flew to [Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville%E2%80%93Spartanburg_International_Airport "Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport") aboard [Air Force One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One "Air Force One") and met with South Carolina officials such as Senator [Lindsey Graham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham "Lindsey Graham") and Governor Henry McMaster to discuss the federal response to Helene in the state before boarding [Marine One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_One "Marine One") and traveling to North Carolina to embark on an aerial tour of Asheville and Lake Lure. Biden was joined by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Asheville Mayor [Esther Manheimer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Manheimer "Esther Manheimer"), FEMA director Deanne Criswell, and [Homeland Security Advisor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Security_Advisor "Homeland Security Advisor") [Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Sherwood-Randall "Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall").[^369] According to Alejandro Mayorkas, the tour was done from the air using Marine One not to impede the emergency response on the ground. Biden also ordered the Department of Defense to deploy up to 1,000 active-duty troops to assist with aid efforts.[^:0-367] After Biden's visit, Graham said in a press conference that Biden needed to intervene in the [port strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_port_strike "2024 United States port strike") due to it potentially jeopardizing the relief efforts in the Carolinas. McMaster said that he and Graham also suggested to Biden during his visit that he intervene in the strike as well.[^370] Vice President Kamala Harris visited Augusta, Georgia, and spoke with residents of the city whom Helene impacted. Harris met with Augusta residents, handed out supplies, spoke about underway relief efforts, and thanked local and state officials such as Augusta Mayor Garnett Johnson. Harris also visited a Red Cross relief center where she received a briefing from local officials about the situation.[^371]

On October 3, President Biden flew to Tallahassee International Airport aboard Air Force One where he then embarked on another aerial tour aboard Marine One of impacted areas while en route to Perry. From Perry, Biden then traveled via motorcade to Keaton Beach where he was joined by Senator [Rick Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott "Rick Scott") and other local officials. Biden spoke to a couple whose home had been destroyed by storm surge and discussed the impacts of the storm with local emergency management officials before returning to Perry where he boarded Marine One and then flew to [Moody Air Force Base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody_Air_Force_Base "Moody Air Force Base") in Georgia.[^372] From Moody Air Force Base, Biden traveled to Shiloh Pecan Farm southwest of [Ray City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_City,_Georgia "Ray City, Georgia") where he said it was time to put aside "rabid partisanship" to help get people relief. [Secretary of Agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture "United States Secretary of Agriculture") [Tom Vilsack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vilsack "Tom Vilsack") accompanied Biden at the farm and he spoke about federal programs to help farmers recover.[^373] Also on October 3, Representative [Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene "Marjorie Taylor Greene") posted online a map showing many Republican-leaning areas affected by Hurricane Helene, stating that "hurricane devastation could affect the election", then separately stated: "Yes they can control the weather … It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done”; the precise meaning of this statement has not been confirmed.[^374][^375]

On October 3, Trump falsely accused the Biden administration of spending FEMA funds meant for disaster relief "on illegal migrants", and thus having "stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank"; he repeated the accusations the next day, which the Biden administration claimed was "poison".[^trumpdid-376][^377] FEMA stated they have separate Congress-approved funds for disaster relief and for migrants (the Shelter and Service Program).[^trumpdid-376]
