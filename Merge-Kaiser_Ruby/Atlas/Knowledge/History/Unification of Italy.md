The **unification of Italy** ([Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): *Unità d'Italia* [\[uniˈtaddiˈtaːlja\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian "Help:IPA/Italian")), also known as the **Risorgimento** (Italian:[\[risordʒiˈmento\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian "Help:IPA/Italian"); lit.' Resurgence '), was the 19th century [political](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement "Political movement") and [social movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement "Social movement") that in 1861 ended in the [annexation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Kingdom_of_Italy "Proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy") of [various states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historic_states_of_Italy "List of historic states of Italy") of the [Italian peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_peninsula "Italian peninsula") and its outlying isles to the [Kingdom of Sardinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sardinia_\(1720%E2%80%931861\) "Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)"), resulting in the creation of the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy"). Inspired by the rebellions in the 1820s and 1830s against the outcome of the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna "Congress of Vienna"), the unification process was precipitated by the [Revolutions of 1848](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848"), and reached completion in [1870](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1870 "1870") after the [capture of Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Rome "Capture of Rome") and its designation as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy.[^1] [^2]

Individuals who played a major part in the struggle for unification and liberation from foreign domination included King [Victor Emmanuel II of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy "Victor Emmanuel II of Italy"); politician, economist and statesman [Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillo_Benso,_Count_of_Cavour "Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour"); general [Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi"); and journalist and politician [Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini").[^3] Borrowing from the old [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") title *[Pater Patriae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_Patriae "Pater Patriae")* of the [Roman emperors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor "Roman emperor"), the [Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians") gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet of *[Father of the Fatherland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Fatherland "Father of the Fatherland")* ([Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): *Padre della Patria*).[^4] Even after [1870](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1870 "1870"), many ethnic Italian-speakers (Italians in [Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol "Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol"), [Savoyard Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoyard_Italians "Savoyard Italians"), [Corfiot Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfiot_Italians "Corfiot Italians"), [Niçard Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%A7ard_Italians "Niçard Italians"), [Swiss Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Italians "Swiss Italians"), [Corsican Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_Italians "Corsican Italians"), [Maltese Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_Italians "Maltese Italians"), [Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians"), and [Dalmatian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_Italians "Dalmatian Italians")) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy, planting the seeds of [Italian irredentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism "Italian irredentism").

Italy celebrates the [anniversary of the unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_of_the_unification_of_Italy "Anniversary of the unification of Italy") on 17 March (the date of [proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Kingdom_of_Italy "Proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy")). Some of the states that had been envisaged as part of the unification process (*terre irredente*) did not join the Kingdom until after Italy defeated [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary") in [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), culminating in the [Treaty of Rapallo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rapallo_\(1920\) "Treaty of Rapallo (1920)") in [1920](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920 "1920"). Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing to that time, which is the view presented at the [Central Museum of the Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Museum_of_the_Risorgimento "Central Museum of the Risorgimento") at [Altare della Patria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altare_della_Patria "Altare della Patria") in Rome.[^5] [^6]

[Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") was unified by the [Roman Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") in the latter part of the third century BCE. For 700 years, it was a *de facto* territorial extension of the capital of the [Roman Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") and [Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), and for a long time experienced a [privileged status but was not converted into a province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Italy "Roman Italy"). Under [Augustus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus"), the previous differences in municipal and political rights were abolished and Roman Italy was subdivided into administrative regions ruled directly by the Roman Senate.

After the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire"), [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Italy "Roman Italy") remained united under the [Ostrogothic Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogothic_Kingdom "Ostrogothic Kingdom") and after 568 was disputed between the [Kingdom of the Lombards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Lombards "Kingdom of the Lombards") and the [Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"), losing its unity for centuries. Following conquest by the [Frankish Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Empire "Frankish Empire"), the title of [King of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_\(Holy_Roman_Empire\) "Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)") merged with the office of [Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor "Holy Roman Emperor"); however, the emperor was an absentee [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") -speaking foreigner who had little interest in governing Italy and indeed never controlled the entire peninsula. As a result, Italy gradually developed into a system of [city-states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_city-states "Italian city-states"). [Southern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy") was governed by the long-lasting [Kingdom of Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily "Kingdom of Sicily") or [Kingdom of Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples "Kingdom of Naples"), which had been established by the Normans. Central Italy was governed by the pope as a temporal kingdom known as the [Papal States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States").

This situation persisted through the [Renaissance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") but began to deteriorate with the rise of modern [nation-states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-state "Nation-state") in the [early modern period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period"). Italy, including the Papal States, then became the site of [proxy wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war "Proxy war") between the major powers, notably the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") (including [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy "Habsburg monarchy")), [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"), and [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France"). Harbingers of national unity appeared in the treaty of the [Italic League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_League "Italic League"), in 1454, and the 15th century foreign policy of [Cosimo de' Medici](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_de%27_Medici "Cosimo de' Medici") and [Lorenzo de' Medici](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici "Lorenzo de' Medici"). Leading Renaissance Italian writers [Dante](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri"), [Petrarch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch"), [Boccaccio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Boccaccio "Giovanni Boccaccio"), [Machiavelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli "Niccolò Machiavelli") and [Guicciardini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Guicciardini "Francesco Guicciardini") expressed opposition to foreign domination. Petrarch stated that the "ancient valour in Italian hearts is not yet dead" in *Italia Mia*. Machiavelli later quoted four verses from *Italia Mia* in *[The Prince](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince "The Prince")*, which looked forward to a political leader who would unite Italy "to free her from the [barbarians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarians "Barbarians") ".[^7]

The [Italian Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars "Italian Wars") **saw 65 years of French attacks on some of the Italian states**, starting with [Charles VIII's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France "Charles VIII of France") invasion of Naples in 1494.
However, the [Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Cateau-Cambr%C3%A9sis "Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis") (1559) saw parts of Italy fall under the direct or indirect control of the [Spanish Habsburgs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Spain "Habsburg Spain"). The [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia") in **1648** formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. However, the **Spanish** branch of the [House of Habsburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg "House of Habsburg"), which ruled the [Spanish Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire"), continued to rule southern Italy and the [Duchy of Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan "Duchy of Milan") until the [War of the Spanish Succession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession "War of the Spanish Succession") (**1701–14**). Following this war the Austrian Habsburgs struggled for dominance with the Spanish [[Bourbons]] until the end of the [War of the Austrian Succession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession "War of the Austrian Succession").

A sense of Italian national identity was reflected in [Gian Rinaldo Carli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Rinaldo_Carli "Gian Rinaldo Carli") 's *Della Patria degli Italiani*,[^8] written in 1764. It told how a stranger entered a café in Milan and puzzled its occupants by saying that he was neither a foreigner nor a Milanese. " 'Then what are you?' they asked. 'I am an Italian', he explained." [^9]


## French Revolution and Napoleonic era

![[~/×/308685138d906dc2485c4d628741d070_MD5.png]]
*Flag of the [Cispadane Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cispadane_Republic "Cispadane Republic"), which was the first [Italian tricolour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy "Flag of Italy") adopted by a sovereign Italian* state (1797)

The Habsburg rule in Italy came to an end with the [campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_campaigns_of_the_French_Revolutionary_Wars "Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars") in **1792–97** when a series of [client republics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_republic "Sister republic") were set up. 

In **1806**, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last [Roman-German Emperor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-German_Emperor "Roman-German Emperor"), [Francis II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor"), after its defeat by [[Napoleon]] at the [Battle of Austerlitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz "Battle of Austerlitz"). 
French rule **destroyed the old structures of feudalism** in Italy and introduced modern ideas and efficient legal authority; it provided much of the intellectual force and social capital that fueled unification movements for decades after the [First French Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire "First French Empire") collapsed in **1814**.[^10]

The French Republic spread republican principles, and the institutions of republican governments promoted citizenship over the rule of the Bourbons and [[Habsburgs]] and other dynasties.[^11] The reaction against any outside control challenged [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte "Napoleon Bonaparte") 's choice of rulers. 

As Napoleon's reign began to fail, the rulers he had installed tried to keep their thrones (among them [Eugène de Beauharnais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_de_Beauharnais "Eugène de Beauharnais"), [Viceroy of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_\(Napoleonic\) "Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)"), and [Joachim Murat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Murat "Joachim Murat"), [King of Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples_\(Napoleonic\) "Kingdom of Naples (Napoleonic)")) further feeding nationalistic sentiments. Beauharnais tried to get [Austrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire") approval for his succession to Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, and on 30 March 1815, Murat issued the [Rimini Proclamation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimini_Proclamation "Rimini Proclamation"), which called on Italians to revolt against their Austrian occupiers.

[During the Napoleonic era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_Napoleonic_Italy "Flags of Napoleonic Italy"), in 1797, the first official adoption of the [Italian tricolour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy "Flag of Italy") as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the [Cispadane Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cispadane_Republic "Cispadane Republic"), a Napoleonic [sister republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_republic "Sister republic") of [Revolutionary France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_France "Revolutionary France"), took place, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789–1799) which, among its ideals, advocated the national [self-determination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination").[^12] [^13] This event is celebrated by the [Tricolour Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolour_Day "Tricolour Day").[^14] The [Italian national colours](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_national_colours "Italian national colours") appeared for the first time on a [tricolour cockade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockade_of_Italy "Cockade of Italy") in 1789,[^15] anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red Italian military [war flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_flag "War flag"), which was adopted by the [Lombard Legion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Legion "Lombard Legion") in 1796.[^16]

[Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini"), a highly influential leader of the Italian revolutionary movement

After Napoleon fell (1814), the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna "Congress of Vienna") (1814–15) restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments. Italy was again controlled largely by the [Austrian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire"),[^17] as they directly controlled the [Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia "Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia") and indirectly the duchies of [Parma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Parma_and_Piacenza "Duchy of Parma and Piacenza"), [Modena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Modena_and_Reggio "Duchy of Modena and Reggio") and [Tuscany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany "Grand Duchy of Tuscany").

With the fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the [absolutist monarchical regimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy"), the [Italian tricolour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_tricolour "Italian tricolour") went underground, becoming the symbol of the patriotic ferments that began to spread in Italy [^18] [^19] and the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence.[^20] [^21] The Italian tricolour waved for the first time in the history of the Risorgimento on 11 March 1821 in the [Cittadella of Alessandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cittadella_of_Alessandria "Cittadella of Alessandria"), during the [revolutions of 1820s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_during_the_1820s "Revolutions during the 1820s"), after the oblivion caused by the restoration of the absolutist monarchical regimes.[^22]

An important figure of this period was [Francesco Melzi d'Eril](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Melzi_d%27Eril "Francesco Melzi d'Eril"), serving as vice-president of the Napoleonic [Italian Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Republic_\(Napoleonic\) "Italian Republic (Napoleonic)") (1802–1805) and consistent supporter of the Italian unification ideals that would lead to the Italian Risorgimento shortly after his death.[^23] Meanwhile, artistic and literary sentiment also turned towards nationalism; [Vittorio Alfieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Alfieri "Vittorio Alfieri"), [Francesco Lomonaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Lomonaco "Francesco Lomonaco") and [Niccolò Tommaseo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Tommaseo "Niccolò Tommaseo") are generally considered three great literary precursors of [Italian nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_nationalism "Italian nationalism"), but the most famous proto-nationalist work was [Alessandro Manzoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni "Alessandro Manzoni") 's [*I promessi sposi* *(The Betrothed)*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Betrothed_\(Manzoni_novel\) "The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)"), widely read as thinly veiled allegorical criticism of Austrian rule. Published in 1827 and extensively revised in the following years, the 1840 version of *I Promessi Sposi* used a standardized version of the [Tuscan dialect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Italy "Languages of Italy"), a conscious effort by the author to provide a language and force people to learn it.[^24]

Three ideals of unification appeared. [Vincenzo Gioberti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Gioberti "Vincenzo Gioberti"), a Piedmontese priest, had suggested a confederation of Italian states under the leadership of the pope in his 1842 book *Of the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians*.[^25] [Pope Pius IX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX "Pope Pius IX") at first appeared interested but he turned reactionary and led the battle against liberalism and nationalism.[^26]

[Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini") and [Carlo Cattaneo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Cattaneo "Carlo Cattaneo") wanted the unification of Italy under a [federal republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic "Federal republic"), which proved too extreme for most nationalists. The middle position was proposed by [Cesare Balbo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Balbo "Cesare Balbo") (1789–1853) as a confederation of separate Italian states led by [Piedmont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sardinia_\(1720%E2%80%931861\) "Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)").[^27]

Animated map of the Italian unification from 1829 to 1871

One of the most influential revolutionary groups was the [Carbonari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonari "Carbonari"), a secret political discussion group formed in [southern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy") early in the 19th century. After 1815, [Freemasonry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry "Freemasonry") in Italy was repressed and discredited due to its French connections. A void was left that the Carbonari filled with a movement that closely resembled Freemasonry but with a commitment to [Italian nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_nationalism "Italian nationalism") and no association with Napoleon and his government. The response came from middle-class professionals and businessmen and some intellectuals. The Carbonari disowned Napoleon but nevertheless were inspired by the principles of the [French Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution") regarding liberty, equality and fraternity. They developed their own rituals and were strongly anticlerical. The Carbonari movement spread across Italy.[^28]

Conservative governments feared the Carbonari, imposing stiff penalties on men discovered to be members. Nevertheless, the movement survived and continued to be a source of political turmoil in Italy from 1820 until after unification. The Carbonari condemned [Napoleon III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III "Napoleon III") (who, as a young man, had fought on their side) to death for [failing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III#Italian_Campaign "Napoleon III") to unite Italy, and the group almost succeeded in assassinating him in 1858, when [Felice Orsini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felice_Orsini "Felice Orsini"), [Giovanni Andrea Pieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giovanni_Andrea_Pieri&action=edit&redlink=1 "Giovanni Andrea Pieri (page does not exist)"), [Carlo Di Rudio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_DeRudio "Charles DeRudio") and [Andrea Gomez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrea_Gomez_\(revolutionary\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Andrea Gomez (revolutionary) (page does not exist)") threw three bombs at him. Many leaders of the unification movement were at one time or other members of this organization. The chief purpose was to defeat tyranny and to establish constitutional government. Although contributing some service to the cause of Italian unity, historians such as Cornelia Shiver doubt that their achievements were proportional to their pretensions.[^29]

The first meeting between [Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi") and [Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini") at the headquarters of [Young Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Italy "Young Italy") in 1833

Many leading Carbonari revolutionaries wanted a republic,[^30] two of the most prominent being [Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini") and [Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi"). Mazzini's activity in revolutionary movements caused him to be imprisoned soon after he joined. While in prison, he concluded that Italy could − and therefore should − be unified, and he formulated a program for establishing a free, independent, and republican nation with [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") as its capital. Following his release in 1831, he went to [Marseille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille "Marseille") in France, where he organized a new political society called [*La Giovine Italia* (Young Italy)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Italy "Young Italy"), whose mottos were " *Dio e Popolo* " ('God and People') and " *Unione, Forza e Libertà* " ('Union, Strength and Freedom"),[^31] [^32] which sought the unification of Italy.

Garibaldi, a native of [Nice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice "Nice") (then part of [Piedmont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont "Piedmont")), participated in an uprising in Piedmont in 1834 and was sentenced to death. He escaped to South America, spending fourteen years in exile, taking part in several wars, and learning the art of guerrilla warfare before his return to Italy in 1848.

Many of the key intellectual and political leaders operated from exile; most Risorgimento patriots lived and published their work abroad after successive failed revolutions. Exile became a central theme of the foundational legacy of the Risorgimento as the narrative of the Italian nation fighting for independence.[^33] The exiles were deeply immersed in European ideas, and often hammered away at what Europeans saw as Italian vices, especially effeminacy and indolence. These negative stereotypes emerged from [Enlightenment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") notions of national character that stressed the influence of the environment and history on a people's moral predisposition. Italian exiles both challenged and embraced the stereotypes and typically presented gendered interpretations of Italy's political "degeneration". They called for a masculine response to feminine weaknesses as the basis of national regeneration and fashioned their image of the future Italian nation firmly in the standards of European nationalism.[^34]

[Guglielmo Pepe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Pepe "Guglielmo Pepe")

In 1820, liberal Spaniards successfully [revolted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trienio_Liberal "Trienio Liberal"), demanding a Constitution, which influenced the development of a similar movement in Italy. Inspired by the Spaniards, a regiment in the army of the [Kingdom of Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Two_Sicilies "Kingdom of Two Sicilies"), commanded by [Guglielmo Pepe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Pepe "Guglielmo Pepe"), a Carbonaro (member of the secret republican organization),[^35] mutinied, conquering the peninsular part of Two Sicilies. The king, [Ferdinand I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_the_Two_Sicilies "Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies"), agreed to enact a new constitution. The revolutionaries, although, failed to court popular support and fell to Austrian troops of the [Holy Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Alliance "Holy Alliance"). Ferdinand abolished the constitution and began systematically persecuting known revolutionaries. Many supporters of revolution in [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily"), including the scholar [Michele Amari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Amari "Michele Amari"), were forced into exile during the decades that followed.[^36]

The leader of the 1821 revolutionary movement in [Piedmont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sardinia_\(1720%E2%80%931861\) "Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)") was [Santorre di Santarosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorre_di_Santarosa "Santorre di Santarosa"), who wanted to remove the Austrians and unify Italy under the [House of Savoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy "House of Savoy"). The Piedmont revolt started in [Alessandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandria "Alessandria"), where troops adopted the green, white, and red [*tricolore*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy "Flag of Italy") of the [Cisalpine Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisalpine_Republic "Cisalpine Republic"). King [Victor Emmanuel I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_I "Victor Emmanuel I") abdicated in response, and the regent for the new king, Prince [Charles Albert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Albert_of_Sardinia "Charles Albert of Sardinia"), approved a new [constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") to appease the revolutionaries, but when King [Charles Felix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Felix_of_Sardinia "Charles Felix of Sardinia") returned he disavowed the constitution and requested assistance from the [Holy Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Alliance "Holy Alliance"). Di Santarosa's troops were defeated, and the would-be Piedmontese revolutionary fled to [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris").[^37]

In [Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan"), [Silvio Pellico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Pellico "Silvio Pellico") and Pietro Maroncelli organized several attempts to weaken the hold of the Austrian despotism by indirect educational means. In October 1820, Pellico and Maroncelli were arrested on the charge of carbonarism and imprisoned.[^38]

[Denis Mack Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Mack_Smith "Denis Mack Smith") argues:

> Few people in 1830 believed that an Italian nation might exist. There were eight states in the peninsula, each with distinct laws and traditions. No one had had the desire or the resources to revive Napoleon's partial experiment in unification. The settlement of 1814–15 had merely restored regional divisions, with the added disadvantage that the decisive victory of Austria over France temporarily hindered Italians in playing off their former oppressors against each other.... Italians who, like [Ugo Foscolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Foscolo "Ugo Foscolo") and [Gabriele Rossetti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Rossetti "Gabriele Rossetti"), harboured patriotic sentiments, were driven into exile. The largest Italian state, the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with its 8 million inhabitants, seemed aloof and indifferent: Sicily and Naples had once been ruled by Spain, and it had always been foreign to the rest of Italy. The common people in each region, and even the intellectual elite, spoke their mutually unintelligible dialects, and lacked the least vestiges of national consciousness. They wanted good government, not self-government, and had welcomed Napoleon and the French as more equitable and efficient than their native dynasties,[^39] many of which had died out in the 18th century.

Ciro Menotti and his compatriots clashed with the army.

After 1830, revolutionary sentiment in favour of a unified Italy began to experience a resurgence, and a series of insurrections laid the groundwork for the creation of one nation along the Italian peninsula.

The [Duke of Modena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Modena_and_Reggio "Duchy of Modena and Reggio"), [Francis IV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_IV_of_Modena "Francis IV of Modena"), was an ambitious man, and he hoped to become king of [northern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy "Northern Italy") by increasing his territory. In 1826, Francis made it clear that he would not act against those who subverted opposition toward the unification of Italy. Encouraged by the declaration, revolutionaries in the region began to organize.

During the [July Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Revolution "July Revolution") of 1830 in France, revolutionaries forced King [Charles X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X_of_France "Charles X of France") to abdicate and created the [July Monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Monarchy "July Monarchy") with encouragement from the new French king, [Louis-Philippe I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Philippe_I "Louis-Philippe I"). Louis-Philippe had promised revolutionaries such as [Ciro Menotti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciro_Menotti "Ciro Menotti") that he would intervene if Austria tried to interfere in Italy with troops. Fearing he would lose his throne, Louis-Philippe did not, however, intervene in Menotti's planned uprising. The Duke of Modena abandoned his Carbonari supporters, arrested Menotti and other conspirators in 1831, and once again conquered his duchy with help from the Austrian troops. Menotti was executed, and the idea of a revolution centred in Modena faded.

At the same time, other insurrections arose in the [Papal Legations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_Legations "Papal Legations") of [Bologna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna "Bologna"), [Ferrara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrara "Ferrara"), [Ravenna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna "Ravenna"), [Forlì](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forl%C3%AC "Forlì"), [Ancona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancona "Ancona") and [Perugia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia "Perugia"). These successful revolutions, which adopted the *tricolore* in place of the [Papal flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flags_of_the_Papacy "List of flags of the Papacy"), quickly spread to cover all the Papal Legations, and their newly installed local governments proclaimed the creation of a united Italian nation. The revolts in Modena and the Papal Legations inspired similar activity in the [Duchy of Parma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Parma "Duchy of Parma"), where the *tricolore* flag was adopted. The Parmese duchess [Marie Louise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Louise_of_Austria "Marie Louise of Austria") left the city during the political upheaval.

Insurrection provinces planned to unite as the [Italian United Provinces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_United_Provinces "Italian United Provinces"), which prompted [Pope Gregory XVI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XVI "Pope Gregory XVI") to ask for Austrian help against the rebels. Austrian Chancellor [Klemens von Metternich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Metternich "Klemens von Metternich") warned Louis-Philippe that Austria had no intention of letting Italian matters be and that French intervention would not be tolerated. Louis-Philippe sent a naval expedition to Ancona, which restored Papal authority there and even arrested Italian patriots living in France. In early 1831, the Austrian army began its march across the Italian peninsula, slowly crushing resistance in each province that had revolted. This military action suppressed much of the fledgling revolutionary movement.

Execution of the [Bandiera Brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandiera_Brothers "Bandiera Brothers")

In 1844, two brothers from [Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"), [Attilio and Emilio Bandiera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandiera_Brothers "Bandiera Brothers"), members of [Young Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Italy "Young Italy"), planned to make a raid on the [Calabrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria "Calabria") coast against the [Kingdom of Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Two_Sicilies "Kingdom of Two Sicilies") in support of Italian unification. They assembled a band of about twenty men ready to sacrifice their lives and set sail on their venture on 12 June 1844. Four days later they landed near [Crotone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotone "Crotone"), intending to go to [Cosenza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosenza "Cosenza"), liberate the political prisoners, and issue their proclamations. Tragically for the Bandiera brothers, they did not find the insurgent band they were told awaited them, so they moved towards [La Sila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sila "La Sila"). They were ultimately betrayed by one of their party, the [Corsican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica "Corsica") Pietro Boccheciampe, and by some peasants who believed them to be Turkish pirates. A detachment of [gendarmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie "Gendarmerie") and volunteers were sent against them, and after a short fight, the whole band was taken prisoner and escorted to Cosenza, where a number of Calabrians who had taken part in a previous rising were also under arrest. The Bandiera brothers and their nine companions were executed by firing squad; some accounts state they cried " *Viva l'Italia!*" ('Long live Italy!') as they fell. The moral effect was enormous throughout Italy, the action of the authorities was universally condemned, and the martyrdom of the Bandiera brothers bore fruit in the subsequent revolutions.[^40]

[Holographic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holograph "Holograph") copy of 1847 of *[Il Canto degli Italiani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Canto_degli_Italiani "Il Canto degli Italiani")*, the Italian [national anthem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem "National anthem") since 1946

In this context, in 1847, the first public performance of the song *[Il Canto degli Italiani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Canto_degli_Italiani "Il Canto degli Italiani")*, the Italian [national anthem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem "National anthem") since 1946, took place.[^41] [^42] *Il Canto degli Italiani*, written by [Goffredo Mameli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goffredo_Mameli "Goffredo Mameli") set to music by [Michele Novaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Novaro "Michele Novaro"), is also known as the *Inno di Mameli*, after the author of the lyrics, or *Fratelli d'Italia*, from its [opening line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incipit "Incipit").

On 5 January 1848, the revolutionary disturbances began with a civil disobedience strike in [Lombardy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy "Lombardy"), as citizens stopped smoking cigars and playing the [lottery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery "Lottery"), which denied Austria the associated tax revenue. Shortly after this, revolts began on the island of [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily") and in [Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "Naples"). In Sicily the revolt resulted in the proclamation of the [Kingdom of Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_revolution_of_1848 "Sicilian revolution of 1848") with [Ruggero Settimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruggero_Settimo "Ruggero Settimo") as chairman of the independent state until 1849, when the Bourbon army took back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force.[^43]

[Ruggero Settimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruggero_Settimo "Ruggero Settimo")

In February 1848, there were revolts in [Tuscany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany "Grand Duchy of Tuscany") that were relatively nonviolent, after which Grand Duke [Leopold II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II,_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany "Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany") granted the Tuscans a constitution. A breakaway republican provisional government formed in Tuscany during February shortly after this concession. On 21 February, [Pope Pius IX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX "Pope Pius IX") granted a constitution to the Papal States, which was both unexpected and surprising considering the historical recalcitrance of the Papacy. On 23 February 1848, King Louis Philippe of France was forced to flee [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), and the [Second French Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_French_Republic "Second French Republic") was proclaimed. By the time the revolution in Paris occurred, three states of Italy had constitutions—four if one considers Sicily to be a separate state.

Meanwhile, in Lombardy, tensions increased until the Milanese and Venetians rose in revolt on 18 March 1848. The insurrection in Milan succeeded in expelling the Austrian garrison after five days of street fights—18–22 March ([Cinque giornate di Milano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Days_of_Milan "Five Days of Milan")). An Austrian army under Marshal [Josef Radetzky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Radetzky "Josef Radetzky") besieged Milan, but due to the defection of many of his troops and the support of the Milanese for the revolt, they were forced to retreat to the [Quadrilatero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilatero "Quadrilatero") fortresses.

Soon, [Charles Albert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Albert_of_Sardinia "Charles Albert of Sardinia"), the King of Sardinia (who ruled Piedmont and [Savoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy "Savoy")), urged by the Venetians and Milanese to aid their cause, decided this was the moment to unify Italy and declared war on Austria ([First Italian Independence War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Italian_Independence_War "First Italian Independence War")). After initial successes at [Goito](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Goito "Battle of Goito") and [Peschiera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peschiera_del_Garda "Peschiera del Garda"), he was decisively defeated by Radetzky at the [Battle of Custoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Custoza_\(1848\) "Battle of Custoza (1848)") on 24 July. An armistice was agreed to, and Radetzky regained control of all of [Lombardy–Venetia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia "Lombardy–Venetia") save [Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice") itself, where the [Republic of San Marco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_San_Marco "Republic of San Marco") was proclaimed under [Daniele Manin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Manin "Daniele Manin").

[Daniele Manin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Manin "Daniele Manin") and [Niccolò Tommaseo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Tommaseo "Niccolò Tommaseo") after the proclamation of the Republic of San Marco

While Radetzky consolidated control of Lombardy–Venetia and Charles Albert licked his wounds, matters took a more serious turn in other parts of Italy. The monarchs who had reluctantly agreed to constitutions in March came into conflict with their constitutional ministers. At first, the republics had the upper hand, forcing the monarchs to flee their capitals, including Pope Pius IX.

Initially, Pius IX had been something of a reformer, but conflicts with the revolutionaries soured him on the idea of constitutional government. In November 1848, following the assassination of his Minister [Pellegrino Rossi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellegrino_Rossi "Pellegrino Rossi"), Pius IX fled just before [Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi") and other patriots arrived in Rome. In early 1849, elections were held for a Constituent Assembly, which proclaimed a [Roman Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic_\(19th_century\) "Roman Republic (19th century)") on 9 February. On 2 February 1849, at a political rally held in the [Apollo Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Theater "Apollo Theater"), a young Roman priest, the Abbé [Carlo Arduini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlo_Arduini&action=edit&redlink=1 "Carlo Arduini (page does not exist)"), had made a speech in which he had declared that the [Temporal power of the Holy See](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_power_of_the_Holy_See "Temporal power of the Holy See") was a "historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality".[^44] In early March 1849, [Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini") arrived in Rome and was appointed Chief Minister. In the Constitution of the Roman Republic,[^45] religious freedom was guaranteed by article 7, the independence of the pope as head of the [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") was guaranteed by article 8 of the *Principi fondamentali*, while the death penalty was abolished by article 5, and free public education was provided by article 8 of the *Titolo I*.

Before the powers could respond to the founding of the Roman Republic, Charles Albert, whose army had been trained by the exiled Polish general [Albert Chrzanowski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Chrzanowski "Albert Chrzanowski"), renewed the war with Austria. He was quickly defeated by Radetzky at [Novara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Novara_\(1849\) "Battle of Novara (1849)") on 23 March 1849. Charles Albert abdicated in favour of his son, [Victor Emmanuel II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II "Victor Emmanuel II"), and Piedmontese ambitions to unite Italy or conquer Lombardy were, for the moment, brought to an end. The war ended with a treaty signed on 9 August. A popular revolt broke out in [Brescia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Days_of_Brescia "Ten Days of Brescia") on the same day as the defeat at Novara, but was suppressed by the Austrians ten days later.

There remained the Roman and [Venetian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_San_Marco "Republic of San Marco") Republics. In April, a French force under [Charles Oudinot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oudinot "Charles Oudinot") was sent to Rome. Apparently, the French first wished to mediate between the pope and his subjects, but soon the French were determined to restore the pope. After a two-month siege, Rome capitulated on 29 June 1849 and the pope was restored. Garibaldi and Mazzini once again fled into exile—in 1850 Garibaldi went to [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). Meanwhile, the Austrians besieged Venice, which was defended by a volunteer army led by [Daniele Manin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Manin "Daniele Manin") and [Guglielmo Pepe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Pepe "Guglielmo Pepe"), who were forced to surrender on 24 August. Pro-independence fighters were [hanged en masse in Belfiore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfiore_martyrs "Belfiore martyrs"), while the Austrians moved to restore order in central Italy, restoring the princes who had been expelled and re-establishing Papal control over the Legations. The revolutions were thus completely crushed.[^46]

Garibaldi and Cavour making Italy in a satirical cartoon of 1861

Morale was of course badly weakened, but the dream of Risorgimento did not die. Instead, the Italian patriots learned some lessons that made them much more effective at the next opportunity in 1860. Military weakness was glaring, as the small Italian states were completely outmatched by France and Austria.

France was a potential ally, and the patriots realized they had to focus all their attention on expelling Austria first, with a willingness to give the French whatever they wanted in return for essential military intervention. As a result of this France received Nice and Savoy in 1860. Secondly, the patriots realized that the pope was an enemy, and could never be the leader of a united Italy. Thirdly, they realized that republicanism was too weak a force. Unification had to be based on a strong monarchy, and in practice that meant reliance on Piedmont (the [Kingdom of Sardinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sardinia_\(1720%E2%80%931861\) "Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)")) under King [Victor Emmanuel II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II "Victor Emmanuel II") (1820–1878) of the [House of Savoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy "House of Savoy").

[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillo_Benso,_Count_of_Cavour "Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour") (1810–1861) provided critical leadership. He was a modernizer interested in agrarian improvements, banks, railways and free trade. He opened a newspaper as soon as censorship allowed it: *[Il Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Risorgimento_\(newspaper\) "Il Risorgimento (newspaper)")* called for the independence of Italy, a league of Italian princes, and moderate reforms. He had the ear of the king and in 1852 became prime minister. He ran an efficient active government, promoting rapid economic modernization while upgrading the administration of the army and the financial and legal systems. He sought out support from patriots across Italy.

In 1855, the kingdom became an ally of [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") and [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_French_Empire "Second French Empire") in the [Crimean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War "Crimean War"), which gave Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.[^47] [^48]

[Victor Emmanuel II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy "Victor Emmanuel II of Italy") (left) and [Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillo_Benso,_Count_of_Cavour "Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour") (right), leading figures in the Italian unification, became respectively the first king and first Prime Minister of unified Italy.

In 1857, [Carlo Pisacane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Pisacane "Carlo Pisacane"), an aristocrat from Naples who had embraced Mazzini's ideas, decided to provoke a rising in the [Kingdom of the Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"). His small force landed on the island of [Ponza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponza "Ponza"). It overpowered guards and liberated hundreds of prisoners. In sharp contrast to his hypothetical expectations, there was no local uprising and the invaders were quickly overpowered. Pisacane was killed by angry locals who suspected he was leading a [Romani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") band trying to steal their food.[^49]

The Second War of Italian Independence began in April 1859 when the Sardinian Prime Minister [Count Cavour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillo_Benso,_Count_of_Cavour "Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour") found an ally in [Napoleon III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III "Napoleon III"). Napoleon III signed a secret alliance and Cavour provoked Austria with military maneuvers and eventually led to the war in April 1859. Cavour called for volunteers to enlist in the Italian liberation. The Austrians planned to use their army to beat the Sardinians before the French could come to their aid. Austria had an army of 140,000 men, while the Sardinians had a mere 70,000 men by comparison. However, the Austrians' numerical strength was outweighed by an ineffectual leadership appointed by the Emperor on the basis of noble lineage, rather than military competency. Their army was slow to enter Piedmont, taking almost ten days to travel the 80 kilometres (50 mi) to [Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin"). By this time, the French had reinforced the Sardinians, so the Austrians retreated.

[Battle of San Fermo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Fermo "Battle of San Fermo")

The Austrians were defeated at the [Battle of Magenta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magenta "Battle of Magenta") on 4 June and pushed back to [Lombardy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy "Lombardy"). Napoleon III's plans worked and at the [Battle of Solferino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino "Battle of Solferino"), France and Sardinia defeated Austria and forced negotiations; at the same time, in the northern part of Lombardy, the Italian volunteers known as the [Hunters of the Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters_of_the_Alps "Hunters of the Alps"), led by [Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi"), defeated the Austrians at [Varese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Varese "Battle of Varese") and [Como](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Fermo "Battle of San Fermo"). On 12 July, the [Armistice of Villafranca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Villafranca "Armistice of Villafranca") was signed. The settlement, by which Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia, left Austria in control of the Veneto and [Mantua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua "Mantua"). The final arrangement was ironed out by "back-room" deals. This was because neither France, Austria, nor Sardinia wanted to risk another battle and could not handle further fighting. All of the sides were eventually unhappy with the outcome of the Second War of Italian Unification and expected another conflict in the future.[^50] In fact, Napoleon III and Cavour were mutually indebted: the first because he had withdrawn from the Second Italian War of Independence before the expected conquest of [Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"), the second because he had allowed the uprisings to spread to the territories of central-northern Italy, thus going beyond what was agreed with the [Plombières Agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plombi%C3%A8res_Agreement "Plombières Agreement").

Pro-Italian protests in Nice, 1871, during the [Niçard Vespers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%A7ard_Vespers "Niçard Vespers")

Sardinia annexed Lombardy from Austria; it later occupied and annexed the [United Provinces of Central Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Provinces_of_Central_Italy "United Provinces of Central Italy"), consisting of the [Grand Duchy of Tuscany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany "Grand Duchy of Tuscany"), the [Duchy of Parma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Parma "Duchy of Parma"), the [Duchy of Modena and Reggio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Modena_and_Reggio "Duchy of Modena and Reggio") and the Papal Legations on 22 March 1860. Sardinia handed Savoy and Nice over to France at the [Treaty of Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Turin_\(1860\) "Treaty of Turin (1860)"), a decision that was the consequence of the Plombières Agreement, on 24 March 1860, an event that caused the [Niçard exodus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%A7ard_exodus "Niçard exodus"), which was the emigration of a quarter of the [Niçard Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%A7ard_Italians "Niçard Italians") to Italy.[^51]

[Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi") was elected in 1871 in Nice at the [National Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_\(France\) "National Assembly (France)") where he tried to promote the annexation of his hometown to the [newborn Italian unitary state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy"), but he was prevented from speaking.[^52] Because of this denial, between 1871 and 1872 there were riots in Nice, promoted by the Garibaldini and called " [Niçard Vespers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%A7ard_Vespers "Niçard Vespers") ",[^53] which demanded the annexation of the city and its area to Italy.[^54] Fifteen Nice people who participated in the rebellion were tried and sentenced.[^55]

[Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi"), celebrated as one of the greatest generals of modern times [^56] and as the "Hero of the Two Worlds" because of his military enterprises in South America and Europe,[^57] who commanded and fought in many military campaigns that led to the unification of Italy

Thus, by early 1860, only five states remained in Italy—the Austrians in Venetia, the [Papal States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States") (now minus the Legations), the new expanded Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the [Kingdom of the Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"), and [San Marino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino "San Marino").[^58] [^59] [^60]

[Francis II of the Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II_of_the_Two_Sicilies "Francis II of the Two Sicilies"), the son and successor of [Ferdinand II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_the_Two_Sicilies "Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies") (the infamous "King Bomba"), had a well-organized army of 150,000 men. But his father's tyranny had inspired many secret societies, and the kingdom's [Swiss mercenaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_mercenaries "Swiss mercenaries") were unexpectedly recalled home under the terms of a new Swiss law that forbade Swiss citizens to serve as mercenaries. This left Francis with only his mostly unreliable native troops. It was a critical opportunity for the unification movement. In April 1860, separate insurrections began in [Messina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina "Messina") and [Palermo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo "Palermo") in Sicily, both of which had demonstrated a history of opposing Neapolitan rule. These rebellions were easily suppressed by loyal troops.

In the meantime, [Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi"), a native of Nice, was deeply resentful of the French annexation of his home city. He hoped to use his supporters to regain the territory. Cavour, terrified of Garibaldi provoking a war with France, persuaded Garibaldi to instead use his forces in the Sicilian rebellions. On 6 May 1860, Garibaldi and his cadre of about a thousand Italian volunteers (called *[I Mille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirts_\(Italy\) "Redshirts (Italy)")*), steamed from [Quarto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_dei_Mille "Quarto dei Mille") near [Genoa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa "Genoa"), and, after a stop in [Talamone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talamone "Talamone") on 11 May, landed near [Marsala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsala "Marsala") on the west coast of Sicily.

Near [Salemi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salemi "Salemi"), Garibaldi's army attracted scattered bands of rebels, and the combined forces defeated the [Army of the Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Two_Sicilies "Army of the Two Sicilies") at the [Battle of Calatafimi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Calatafimi "Battle of Calatafimi") on 13 May. Within three days, the invading force had swelled to 4,000 men. On 14 May Garibaldi proclaimed himself [dictator of Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_Garibaldi "Dictatorship of Garibaldi"), in the name of Victor Emmanuel. After waging various successful but hard-fought battles, Garibaldi advanced upon the Sicilian capital of Palermo, announcing his arrival by beacon-fires kindled at night. On 27 May the force began the [Siege of Palermo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Palermo "Siege of Palermo"), while a mass uprising of street and barricade fighting broke out within the city.

[Battle of Calatafimi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Calatafimi "Battle of Calatafimi")

With Palermo deemed insurgent, Neapolitan general [Ferdinando Lanza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinando_Lanza "Ferdinando Lanza"), arriving in Sicily with some 25,000 troops, furiously bombarded Palermo nearly to ruins. With the intervention of a British admiral, an armistice was declared, leading to the Neapolitan troops' departure and surrender of the town to Garibaldi and his much smaller army.

This resounding success demonstrated the weakness of the Neapolitan government. Garibaldi's fame spread and many Italians began to consider him a national hero. Doubt, confusion, and dismay overtook the Neapolitan court—the king hastily summoned his ministry and offered to restore an earlier constitution, but these efforts failed to rebuild the people's trust in [Bourbon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon-Two_Sicilies "House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies") governance.

Six weeks after the surrender of Palermo, Garibaldi attacked Messina. Within a week, its citadel surrendered. Having conquered Sicily, Garibaldi proceeded to the mainland, crossing the [Strait of Messina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Messina "Strait of Messina") with the Neapolitan fleet at hand. The garrison at [Reggio Calabria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Calabria "Reggio Calabria") promptly surrendered. As he marched northward, the populace everywhere hailed him, and military resistance faded: on 18 and 21 August, the people of [Basilicata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilicata "Basilicata") and [Apulia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia "Apulia"), two regions of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, independently declared their annexation to the Kingdom of Italy. At the end of August, Garibaldi was at [Cosenza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosenza "Cosenza"), and, on 5 September, at [Eboli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eboli "Eboli"), near [Salerno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salerno "Salerno"). Meanwhile, [Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "Naples") had declared a state of siege, and on 6 September the king gathered the 4,000 troops still faithful to him and retreated over the [River Volturno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volturno "Volturno"). The next day, Garibaldi, with a few followers, entered by train into Naples, where the people openly welcomed him.[^61]

People cheering as Garibaldi enters Naples

Although Garibaldi had easily taken the capital, the Neapolitan army had not joined the rebellion *en masse*, holding firm along the River Volturno. Garibaldi's irregular bands of about 25,000 men could not drive away the king or take the fortresses of [Capua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capua "Capua") and [Gaeta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaeta "Gaeta") without the help of the [Royal Sardinian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Sardinian_Army "Royal Sardinian Army"). The Sardinian army, however, could only arrive by traversing the Papal States, which extended across the entire center of the peninsula. Ignoring the political will of the [Holy See](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See"), Garibaldi announced his intent to proclaim a "Kingdom of Italy" from [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome"), the capital city of [Pope Pius IX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX "Pope Pius IX"). Seeing this as a threat to the domain of the Catholic Church, Pius threatened [excommunication](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication "Excommunication") for those who supported such an effort. Afraid that Garibaldi would attack Rome, Catholics worldwide sent money and volunteers for the Papal Army, which was commanded by General [Louis Lamoricière](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christophe_L%C3%A9on_Louis_Juchault_de_Lamorici%C3%A8re "Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière"), a French exile.

The settling of the peninsular standoff now rested with Napoleon III. If he let Garibaldi have his way, Garibaldi would probably end the temporal sovereignty of the pope and make Rome the capital of Italy. Napoleon, however, may have arranged with Cavour to let the King of Sardinia free to take possession of Naples, [Umbria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbria "Umbria") and the other provinces, provided that Rome and the " [Patrimony of Saint Peter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrimony_of_Saint_Peter "Patrimony of Saint Peter") " were left intact.[^62]

It was in this situation that a Sardinian force of two army corps, under generals [Manfredo Fanti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfredo_Fanti "Manfredo Fanti") and [Enrico Cialdini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Cialdini "Enrico Cialdini"), marched to the frontier of the Papal States, its objective being not Rome but Naples. The Papal troops under Lamoricière advanced against Cialdini, but were quickly defeated at the [Battle of Castelfidardo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Castelfidardo "Battle of Castelfidardo") and besieged in the fortress of [Ancona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancona "Ancona"), finally surrendering on 29 September. On 9 October, Victor Emmanuel arrived and took command. There was no longer a Papal army to oppose him, and the march southward proceeded unopposed.

[Victor Emmanuel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy "Victor Emmanuel II of Italy") meets Garibaldi near [Teano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teano "Teano").

Garibaldi distrusted the pragmatic Cavour since Cavour was the man ultimately responsible for orchestrating the French annexation of the city of Nice, which was his birthplace. Nevertheless, he accepted the command of Victor Emmanuel. When the king entered [Sessa Aurunca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessa_Aurunca "Sessa Aurunca") at the head of his army, Garibaldi willingly handed over his dictatorial power. After greeting Victor Emmanuel in [Teano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teano "Teano") with the title of [King of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Italy "King of Italy"), Garibaldi entered Naples riding beside the king. Garibaldi then retired to the island of [Caprera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprera "Caprera"), while the remaining work of unifying the peninsula was left to Victor Emmanuel.

The progress of the Sardinian army compelled Francis II to give up his line along the river, and he eventually took refuge with his best troops in the fortress of Gaeta. His courage boosted by his resolute young wife, Queen [Marie Sophie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Sophie_of_Bavaria "Marie Sophie of Bavaria"), Francis mounted a stubborn defence that lasted three months. But European allies refused to provide him with aid, food and munitions became scarce, and disease set in, so the garrison was forced to surrender. Nonetheless, ragtag groups of Neapolitans loyal to Francis fought on against the Italian government for years to come.

The fall of Gaeta brought the unification movement to the brink of fruition—only [Lazio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazio "Lazio") and [Venetia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetia_\(region\) "Venetia (region)") remained to be added. On 18 February 1861, Victor Emmanuel assembled the deputies of the first [Italian Parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_Kingdom_of_Italy "Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy") in Turin. On 17 March 1861, the [Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel King of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Kingdom_of_Italy "Proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy"), and on 27 March 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy, although it was not yet in the new kingdom.[^63]

Borrowing from the old [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") title *[Pater Patriae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_Patriae "Pater Patriae")* of the [Roman emperors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor "Roman emperor"), the [Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians") gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet of *[Father of the Fatherland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Fatherland "Father of the Fatherland")* ([Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): *Padre della Patria*).[^4] Three months later Cavour died, having seen his life's work nearly completed. When he was given the last rites, Cavour purportedly said: "Italy is made. All is safe." [^64]

The disapproval of the various European states culminated in the direct participation of the Sardinian army in the [Expedition of the Thousand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_of_the_Thousand "Expedition of the Thousand").[^65] In reaction, [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") and the [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") interrupted diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Sardinia, while the [Austrian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire"), which had not maintained relations with this country since 1859, after the Second Italian War of Independence,[^65] sent its troops to the [Mincio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincio "Mincio") border. [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") made no hostile statements, but recalled its ambassador. [Queen Victoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria "Queen Victoria") and her prime minister [John Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell "John Russell, 1st Earl Russell") convinced the [Kingdom of Prussia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia "Kingdom of Prussia") not to hinder the ongoing process of Italian unification.[^66] On 26 October 1860, the same day as the meeting in Teano between the king and Garibaldi, Austria organized a congress in [Warsaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw "Warsaw") to apply measures against the Kingdom of Sardinia, without success; held back by this crisis, Cavour was unable to be present at Teano.[^65]

After the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, the [United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") and the [Swiss Confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Confederation "Swiss Confederation") were the first to recognize the new state (30 March 1861), followed by the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") on 13 April.[^65] [^67] France negotiated the presence of French troops in Rome and recognized the Kingdom of Italy on 15 June, shortly after Cavour's death. It was then [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") 's turn on 27 June, followed by [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece"), the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") and the [Scandinavian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") countries. The recognition of the [Netherlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") and [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium") occurred in two phases: they recognized the new title of Victor Emmanuel II in July, then the kingdom in November, after a long clash between conservatives and liberals in the Belgian parliament over the latter.[^67]

Mazzini was discontented with the perpetuation of monarchical government and continued to agitate for a republic. With the motto "Free from the [Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps") to the [Adriatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea") ", the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. There were obstacles, however. A challenge against the pope's temporal dominion was viewed with profound distrust by Catholics around the world, and there were French troops stationed in Rome. Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Papal States, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions.[^68]

Nonetheless, Garibaldi believed that the government would support him if he attacked Rome. Frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, he came out of retirement to organize a new venture. In June 1862, he sailed from Genoa and landed again at Palermo, where he gathered volunteers for the campaign, under the slogan *o Roma o Morte* ('either Rome or Death'). The garrison of Messina, loyal to the king's instructions, barred their passage to the mainland. Garibaldi's force, now numbering two thousand, turned south and set sail from [Catania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catania "Catania"). Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at [Melito](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melito_di_Porto_Salvo "Melito di Porto Salvo") on 14 August and marched at once into the [Calabrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria "Calabria") mountains.

*The Injured Garibaldi in the [Aspromonte Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspromonte "Aspromonte")* (oil on canvas), credited to [Gerolamo Induno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Induno "Gerolamo Induno")

Far from supporting this endeavour, the Italian government was quite disapproving. General Cialdini dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Pallavicino, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August the two forces met at [Aspromonte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aspromonte "Battle of Aspromonte"). One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, but Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the Kingdom of Italy. The volunteers suffered several casualties, and Garibaldi himself was wounded; many were taken prisoner. Garibaldi was taken by steamer to [Varignano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignano,_La_Spezia "Varignano, La Spezia"), where he was honorably imprisoned for a time, but finally released.[^69]

Meanwhile, Victor Emmanuel sought a safer means to the acquisition of the remaining Papal territory. He negotiated with the Emperor Napoleon for the removal of the French troops from Rome through a treaty. They agreed to the [September Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_Convention "September Convention") in September 1864, by which Napoleon agreed to withdraw the troops within two years. The pope was to expand his own army during that time so as to be self-sufficient. In December 1866, the last of the French troops departed from Rome, in spite of the efforts of the pope to retain them. By their withdrawal, Italy (excluding Venetia and Savoy) was freed from the presence of foreign soldiers.[^70]

The seat of government was moved in 1865 from [Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin"), the old Sardinian capital, to [Florence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"). This arrangement created such disturbances in Turin that the king was forced to leave that city hastily for his new capital.[^71]

[Battle of Bezzecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bezzecca "Battle of Bezzecca")

In the [Austro-Prussian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War "Austro-Prussian War") of 1866, Austria contested with [Prussia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia") the position of leadership among the German states. The Kingdom of Italy seized the opportunity to capture [Venetia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetia_\(region\) "Venetia (region)") from Austrian rule and allied itself with Prussia.[^72] Austria tried to persuade the Italian government to accept Venetia in exchange for non-intervention. However, on 8 April, Italy and Prussia signed an agreement that supported Italy's acquisition of Venetia, and on 20 June Italy issued a declaration of war on Austria. Within the context of Italian unification, the Austro-Prussian war is called the *Third Independence War*, after the *First* (1848) and the *Second* (1859).[^73]

Victor Emmanuel hastened to lead an army across the [Mincio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincio "Mincio") to the invasion of Venetia, while Garibaldi was to [invade the Tyrol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Trentino_\(1866\) "Invasion of Trentino (1866)") with his [Hunters of the Alps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters_of_the_Alps "Hunters of the Alps"). The Italian army encountered the Austrians at [Custoza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Custoza_\(1866\) "Battle of Custoza (1866)") on 24 June and suffered a defeat. On 20 July the [Regia Marina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regia_Marina "Regia Marina") was defeated in the [Battle of Lissa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lissa_\(1866\) "Battle of Lissa (1866)"). The following day, Garibaldi's volunteers defeated an Austrian force in the [Battle of Bezzecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bezzecca "Battle of Bezzecca"), and moved toward [Trento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento "Trento").[^74]

Meanwhile, [Prussian Minister President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_President_of_Prussia "Minister President of Prussia") [Otto von Bismarck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck "Otto von Bismarck") saw that his own ends in the war had been achieved, and signed an armistice with Austria on 27 July. Italy followed, officially [laying down its arms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Cormons "Armistice of Cormons") on 12 August. Garibaldi was recalled from his successful march and resigned with a brief telegram reading only " *Obbedisco* " ('I obey').

[Victor Emmanuel II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II "Victor Emmanuel II") in Venice

Prussia's success on the northern front obliged Austria to cede Venetia (present-day [Veneto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto "Veneto") and parts of [Friuli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli "Friuli")) and the city of [Mantua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua "Mantua") (the last remnant of the *[Quadrilatero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilatero "Quadrilatero")*). Under the terms of a peace treaty signed in [Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") on 12 October, Emperor [Franz Joseph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph "Franz Joseph") had already agreed to cede Venetia to Napoleon III in exchange for non-intervention in the Austro-Prussian War, and thus Napoleon ceded Venetia to Italy on 19 October, in exchange for the earlier Italian acquiescence to the [French annexation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Savoy "Annexation of Savoy") of [Savoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy "Savoy") and [Nice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice "Nice").

In the [Treaty of Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Vienna_\(1866\) "Treaty of Vienna (1866)"), it was written that the annexation of Venetia would have become effective only after a [referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebiscite_of_Veneto_of_1866 "Plebiscite of Veneto of 1866") —taken on 21 and 22 October—to let the Venetian people express their will about being annexed or not to the Kingdom of Italy. Historians suggest that the referendum in Venetia was held under military pressure,[^75] as a mere 0.01% of voters (69 out of more than 642,000 ballots) voted against the annexation.[^76]

Austrian forces put up some opposition to the invading Italians, to little effect. Victor Emmanuel entered Venice and Venetian land, and performed an act of homage in the [Piazza San Marco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco "Piazza San Marco").[^77]

Garibaldi at [Mentana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mentana "Battle of Mentana"), 3 November 1867

The national party, with Garibaldi at its head, still aimed at the possession of Rome, as the historic capital of the peninsula. In 1867 Garibaldi made a second attempt to capture Rome, but the Papal army, strengthened with a new French auxiliary force, defeated his poorly armed volunteers at [Mentana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mentana "Battle of Mentana"). Subsequently, a French garrison remained in [Civitavecchia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civitavecchia "Civitavecchia") until August 1870, when it was recalled following the outbreak of the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War "Franco-Prussian War").

Before the defeat at Mentana on 3 November 1867,[^78] Enrico Cairoli, his brother Giovanni, and 70 companions had made a daring attempt to take Rome. The group had embarked in [Terni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terni "Terni") and floated down the [Tiber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber "Tiber"). Their arrival in Rome was to coincide with an uprising inside the city. On 22 October 1867, the revolutionaries inside Rome seized control of the [Capitoline Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Hill "Capitoline Hill") and of [Piazza Colonna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Colonna "Piazza Colonna"). Unfortunately for the Cairoli and their companions, by the time they arrived at Villa Glori, on the northern outskirts of Rome, the uprising had already been suppressed. During the night of 22 October 1867, the group was surrounded by [Papal Zouaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_Zouaves "Papal Zouaves"), and Giovanni was severely wounded. Enrico was mortally wounded and bled to death in Giovanni's arms.

With Cairoli dead, command was assumed by Giovanni Tabacchi who had retreated with the remaining volunteers into the villa, where they continued to fire at the papal soldiers. These also retreated in the evening to Rome. The survivors retreated to the positions of those led by Garibaldi on the Italian border.

At the summit of Villa Glori, near the spot where Enrico died, there is a plain white column dedicated to the Cairoli brothers and their 70 companions. About 200 meters to the right from the Terrazza del Pincio, there is a bronze monument of Giovanni holding the dying Enrico in his arm. A plaque lists the names of their companions. Giovanni never recovered from his wounds and from the tragic events of 1867. According to an eyewitness,[^79] when Giovanni died on 11 September 1869:

> In the last moments, he had a vision of Garibaldi and seemed to greet him with enthusiasm. I heard (so says a friend who was present) him say three times: "The union of the French to the papal political supporters was the terrible fact!", he was thinking about Mentana. He called Enrico many times, that he might help him, then he said: "but we will certainly win; we will go to Rome!"

[Capture of Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Rome "Capture of Rome")

In July 1870, the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War "Franco-Prussian War") began. In early August, the French Emperor [Napoleon III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III "Napoleon III") recalled his garrison from Rome, thus no longer providing protection to the Papal State. Widespread public demonstrations illustrated the demand that the Italian government take Rome. The Italian government took no direct action until the collapse of the [Second French Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_French_Empire "Second French Empire") at the [Battle of Sedan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sedan "Battle of Sedan"). King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count [Gustavo Ponza di San Martino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Ponza_di_San_Martino "Gustavo Ponza di San Martino") to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. The Papacy, however, exhibited something less than enthusiasm for the plan:

> The pope's reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King's letter upon the table he exclaimed, "Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith." He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. After, growing calmer, he exclaimed: "I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!". San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.[^80]

The [Royal Italian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Italian_Army "Royal Italian Army"), commanded by General [Raffaele Cadorna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffaele_Cadorna "Raffaele Cadorna"), crossed the Papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [Aurelian Walls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian_Walls "Aurelian Walls") on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although now convinced of his unavoidable defeat, Pius IX remained intransigent to the bitter end and forced his troops to put up a token resistance. On 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the Aurelian Walls at [Porta Pia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porta_Pia "Porta Pia"), the [Bersaglieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bersaglieri "Bersaglieri") entered Rome and marched down *Via Pia*, which was subsequently renamed *Via XX Settembre*. Forty-nine Italian soldiers and four officers, and nineteen papal troops, died. Rome and [Latium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latium "Latium") were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite held on 2 October. The results of this plebiscite were accepted by decree of 9 October.

The [Quirinal Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinal_Palace "Quirinal Palace") in [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") became the official residence (royal residence of the [Kings of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Italy "Kings of Italy") and after the [Italian constitutional referendum, 1946](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_constitutional_referendum,_1946 "Italian constitutional referendum, 1946") residence and workplace for the [Presidents of the Italian Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Italy "President of Italy")).

Initially the Italian government had offered to let the pope keep the [Leonine City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonine_City "Leonine City") under the [Law of Guarantees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Guarantees "Law of Guarantees"), but the pope rejected the offer because acceptance would have been an implied endorsement of the legitimacy of the Italian kingdom's rule over his former domain. Pius IX declared himself a [prisoner in the Vatican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_in_the_Vatican "Prisoner in the Vatican"), although he was not actually restrained from coming and going. Rather, being deposed and stripped of much of his former power also removed a measure of personal protection—if he had walked the streets of Rome, he might have been in danger from political opponents who had formerly kept their views private. Officially, the capital was not moved from Florence to Rome until July 1871.[^81]

Historian Raffaele de Cesare made the following observations about Italian unification:

> The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet – that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made Emperor, and was supported by the votes of the Conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the [Pontiff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff "Pontiff").[^82]

> For twenty years Napoleon III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations…. Without him the temporal power would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured.[^83]

Unification was achieved entirely in terms of Piedmont's interests. Martin Clark says, "It was Piedmontization all around." [^84] Cavour died unexpectedly in June 1861, at 50, and most of the many promises that he made to regional authorities to induce them to join the newly unified Italian kingdom were ignored. The new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures. The first king was Victor Emmanuel II, who kept his old title.

National and regional officials were all appointed by Piedmont. A few regional leaders succeeded to high positions in the new national government, but the top bureaucratic and military officials were mostly Piedmontese. The national capital was briefly moved to Florence and finally to Rome, one of the cases of Piedmont losing out.

However, Piedmontese tax rates and regulations, diplomats and officials were imposed on all of Italy. The constitution was Piedmont's [old constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statuto_Albertino "Statuto Albertino"). The document was generally liberal and was welcomed by liberal elements. However, its anticlerical provisions were resented in the pro-clerical regions in places such as around Venice, Rome, and Naples—as well as the island of Sicily. Cavour had promised there would be regional and municipal, local governments, but all the promises were broken in 1861.

The first decade of the kingdom saw [savage insurrections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigandage_in_Southern_Italy_after_1861 "Brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861") in Sicily and in the Naples region. Hearder claimed that failed efforts to protest unification involved "a mixture of spontaneous peasant movement and a Bourbon-clerical reaction directed by the old authorities".[^85]

The pope lost Rome in 1870 and ordered the Catholic Church not to co-operate with the new government, [a decision fully reversed only in 1929](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Treaty "Lateran Treaty").[^86] Most people for Risorgimento had wanted strong provinces, but they got a strong central state instead. The inevitable long-run results were a severe weakness of national unity and a politicized system based on mutually hostile regional violence. Such factors remain in the 21st century.[^87]

From the spring of 1860 to the summer of 1861, a major challenge that the [Piedmontese parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_Kingdom_of_Sardinia "Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia") faced on national unification was how they should govern and control the southern regions of the country that were frequently represented and described by northern Italian correspondents as "corrupt", "barbaric", and "uncivilized".[^88] In response to the depictions of [southern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy"), the Piedmontese parliament had to decide whether it should investigate the southern regions to better understand the social and political situations there or it should establish jurisdiction and order by using mostly force.[^89]

The dominance of letters sent from the northern Italian correspondents that deemed southern Italy to be "so far from the ideas of progress and civilization" ultimately induced the Piedmontese parliament to choose the latter course of action, which effectively illustrated the intimate connection between representation and rule.[^90] In essence, the northern Italians' "representation of the south as a land of barbarism (variously qualified as indecent, lacking in 'public conscience', ignorant, superstitious, etc.)" provided the Piedmontese with the justification to rule the southern regions on the pretext of implementing a superior, more civilized, "Piedmontese morality".[^90]

Massimo d'Azeglio, a [moderate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate_Party_\(Italy\) "Moderate Party (Italy)") liberal statesman, novelist, and painter (1798–1866)

Italian unification is still a topic of debate. According to [Massimo d'Azeglio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_d%27Azeglio "Massimo d'Azeglio"), centuries of foreign domination created remarkable differences in Italian society, and the role of the newly formed government was to face these differences and to create a unified Italian society. Still today the most famous quote of Massimo d'Azeglio is, "L'Italia è fatta. Restano da fare gli italiani" ('Italy has been made. Now it remains to make Italians').[^91]

The economist and politician [Francesco Saverio Nitti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Saverio_Nitti "Francesco Saverio Nitti") criticized the newly created state for not considering the substantial economic differences between [northern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy "Northern Italy"), a [free-market economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market"), and [southern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy"), a state [protectionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism "Protectionism") economy, when integrating the two. When the Kingdom of Italy extended the free-market economy to the rest of the country, the south's economy collapsed under the weight of the north's. Nitti contended that this change should have been much more gradual in order to allow the birth of an adequate entrepreneurial class able to make strong investments and initiatives in the south. These mistakes, he felt, were the cause of the economic and social problems which came to be known as the [southern question](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_question "Southern question") (*Questione Meridionale*).[^92] [^93]

The politician, historian, and writer [Gaetano Salvemini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Salvemini "Gaetano Salvemini") commented that although Italian unification had been a strong opportunity for both a moral and economic rebirth of Italy's *Mezzogiorno* ([southern Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy")), because of a lack of understanding and action on the part of politicians, corruption and organized crime flourished in the south.[^94] The Marxist theorist [Antonio Gramsci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci "Antonio Gramsci") criticized Italian unification for the limited presence of the masses in politics, as well as the lack of modern [land reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform "Land reform") in Italy.[^95]

[Revisionism of Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionism_of_Risorgimento "Revisionism of Risorgimento") produced a clear radicalization of Italy in the mid-20th century, following the fall of the [Savoy monarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy "House of Savoy") and [fascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") during World War II. Reviews of the historical facts concerning Italian unification's successes and failures continue to be undertaken by domestic and foreign academic authors, including [Denis Mack Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Mack_Smith "Denis Mack Smith"), [Christopher Duggan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Duggan_\(historian\) "Christopher Duggan (historian)"), and [Lucy Riall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Riall "Lucy Riall"). Recent work emphasizes the central importance of nationalism.[^96] [^97]

The [Sette Giugno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sette_Giugno "Sette Giugno") monument, symbol of the pro- [Italian Maltese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Maltese "Italian Maltese")

It can be argued that Italian unification was never truly completed in the 19th century. Even after the [Capture of Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Rome "Capture of Rome") (1871), the final event of the unification of Italy, many ethnic [Italian speakers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") ([Trentino-Alto Adigan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol "Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol") Italians, [Savoyard Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoyard_Italians "Savoyard Italians"), [Corfiot Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfiot_Italians "Corfiot Italians"), [Niçard Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%A7ard_Italians "Niçard Italians"), [Swiss Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Italians "Swiss Italians"), [Corsican Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_Italians "Corsican Italians"), [Maltese Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_Italians "Maltese Italians"), [Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians") and [Dalmatian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_Italians "Dalmatian Italians")) remained outside the borders of the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy") and this situation created the [Italian irredentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism "Italian irredentism").

The Corsican revolutionary [Pasquale Paoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasquale_Paoli "Pasquale Paoli") was called "the precursor of Italian irredentism" by [Niccolò Tommaseo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Tommaseo "Niccolò Tommaseo") because he was the first to promote the Italian language and socio-culture (the main characteristics of Italian irredentism) in his island; Paoli wanted the [Italian language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") to be the official language of the newly founded [Corsican Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_Republic "Corsican Republic").[^98]

The term *Risorgimento* refers to the domestic reorganization of the stratified Italian identity into a unified, national front. The word literally means 'rising again' and was an ideological movement which strove to spark national pride, leading to political oppositionalism to foreign rule and influence. There is contention on its actual impact in Italy, some Scholars arguing it was a liberalizing time for 19th century Italian culture, while others speculate that although it was a patriotic revolution, it only tangibly aided the upper-class and [bourgeois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") publics without actively benefitting the lower classes.[^99]

*[Italia irredenta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_irredenta "Italia irredenta")* was an Italian [nationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism") opinion movement that emerged after Italian unification. It advocated irredentism among the Italian people as well as other nationalities who were willing to become Italian and as a movement; it is also known as "Italian irredentism". Not a formal organization, it was just an opinion movement that claimed that Italy had to reach its "natural borders", meaning that the country would need to incorporate all areas predominantly consisting of ethnic Italians within the near vicinity outside its borders. Similar patriotic and nationalistic ideas were common in Europe in the 19th century.[^100]

Residents of [Fiume](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiume "Fiume") cheering [Gabriele D'Annunzio and his *Legionari*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresa_di_Fiume "Impresa di Fiume") in September 1919. The Italians claimed Fiume on the principle of self-determination, disregarding its mainly Slavic suburb of Susak.[^101]

At the beginning, Italian irredentism promoted the annexation to Italy of territories where Italians formed the absolute majority of the population, but retained by the [Austrian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire") after the [Third Italian War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Italian_War_of_Independence "Third Italian War of Independence") in 1866. During [World War One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_One "World War One") the main "irredent lands" (*terre irredente*) were considered to be the provinces of [Trento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento "Trento") and [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste "Trieste") and, in a narrow sense, irredentists referred to the Italian patriots living in these two areas.

The term was later expanded to also include multilingual and multiethnic areas, where Italians were a relative majority or a substantial minority, within the northern Italian region encompassed by the Alps, with [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans "Germans"), [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians"), [Slovene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenes "Slovenes"), [Croatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats "Croats"), [Ladin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladin_people "Ladin people") and [Istro-Romanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istro-Romanians "Istro-Romanians") population, such as [South Tyrol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol "South Tyrol"), [Istria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria "Istria"), [Gorizia and Gradisca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorizia_and_Gradisca "Gorizia and Gradisca") and part of [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia"). The claims were further extended also to the city of [Fiume](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijeka "Rijeka") (see *[Impresa di Fiume](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresa_di_Fiume "Impresa di Fiume")*), [Corsica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica "Corsica"), the island of [Malta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta "Malta"), the [County of Nice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Nice "County of Nice") and [Italian Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Switzerland "Italian Switzerland").

Many [Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians") and [Dalmatian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_Italians "Dalmatian Italians") looked with sympathy towards the Risorgimento movement that fought for the unification of Italy.[^102] However, after the [Third Italian War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Italian_War_of_Independence "Third Italian War of Independence") (1866), when the [Veneto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto "Veneto") and [Friuli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli "Friuli") regions were ceded by the [Austrians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire") to the newly formed [Kingdom Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_\(1861%E2%80%931946\) "Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)"), Istria and Dalmatia remained part of the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire "Austro-Hungarian Empire"), together with other Italian-speaking areas on the eastern Adriatic. This triggered the gradual rise of [Italian irredentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism "Italian irredentism") among many Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia, who demanded the unification of the [Julian March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_March "Julian March"), [Kvarner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvarner_Gulf "Kvarner Gulf") and [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia") with Italy. The Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia supported the Italian Risorgimento: as a consequence, the Austrians saw the Italians as enemies and favored the Slav communities of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia.[^103] During the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 12 November 1866, Emperor [Franz Joseph I of Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria "Franz Joseph I of Austria") outlined a wide-ranging project aimed at the [Germanization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanization "Germanization") or [Slavization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavization "Slavization") of the areas of the empire with an Italian presence:[^104]

In green the areas where [Slavs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs "Slavs") were the majority of the population, in orange the areas where [Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians") and [Dalmatian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_Italians "Dalmatian Italians") were the majority of the population. The boundaries of [Venetian Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Dalmatia "Venetian Dalmatia") in 1797 are delimited with blue dots.

> His Majesty expressed the precise order that action be taken decisively against the influence of the Italian elements still present in some regions of the Crown and, appropriately occupying the posts of public, judicial, masters employees as well as with the influence of the press, work in [South Tyrol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol "Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol"), [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia") and [Littoral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Littoral "Austrian Littoral") for the Germanization and Slavization of these territories according to the circumstances, with energy and without any regard. His Majesty calls the central offices to the strong duty to proceed in this way to what has been established.

— Franz Joseph I of Austria, Council of the Crown of 12 November 1866 [^103] [^105]

[Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians") made up about a third of the population in 1900.[^106] Dalmatia, especially its maritime cities, once had a substantial local ethnic Italian population ([Dalmatian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_Italians "Dalmatian Italians")). According to Austrian census, the Dalmatian Italians formed 12.5% of the population in 1865.[^107] In the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, Istria had a population of 57.8% Slavic-speakers (Croat and Slovene), and 38.1% Italian speakers.[^108] For the Austrian [Kingdom of Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Dalmatia "Kingdom of Dalmatia"), (i.e. [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia")), the 1910 numbers were 96.2% Slavic speakers and 2.8% Italian speakers.[^109]

The Italian population in Dalmatia was concentrated in the major coastal cities. In the city of [Split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia "Split, Croatia") in 1890 there were 1,969 Dalmatian Italians (12.5% of the population), in [Zadar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar "Zadar") 7,423 (64.6%), in [Šibenik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ibenik "Šibenik") 1,018 (14.5%), in [Kotor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotor "Kotor") 623 (18.7%) and in [Dubrovnik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik "Dubrovnik") 331 (4.6%).[^110] In other Dalmatian localities, according to Austrian censuses, Dalmatian Italians experienced a sudden decrease: in the twenty years 1890-1910, in [Rab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_\(island\) "Rab (island)") they went from 225 to 151, in [Vis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis_\(island\) "Vis (island)") from 352 to 92, in [Pag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pag_\(island\) "Pag (island)") from 787 to 23, completely disappearing in almost all the inland locations. In 1909 the [Italian language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") lost its [status](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_\(law\) "Status (law)") as the official language of Dalmatia in favor of Croatian only (previously both languages were recognized): thus Italian could no longer be used in the public and administrative sphere.[^111]

Territories promised to Italy by the [Treaty of London (1915)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_\(1915\) "Treaty of London (1915)"), i.e. [Trentino-Alto Adige](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige "Trentino-Alto Adige"), the [Julian March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_March "Julian March") and [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia") (tan), and the [Snežnik Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sne%C5%BEnik_\(plateau\) "Snežnik (plateau)") area (green). Dalmatia, after the WWI, however, was not assigned to Italy but to [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia").

Italy [entered into the First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_entry_into_World_War_I "Italian entry into World War I") in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the First World War is also considered the [Fourth Italian War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Italian_War_of_Independence "Fourth Italian War of Independence"),[^112] in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the [revolutions of 1848](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848") with the [First Italian War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Italian_War_of_Independence "First Italian War of Independence").[^113] [^114]

During the post-unification era, some Italians were dissatisfied with the current state of the Italian Kingdom since they wanted the kingdom to include [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triest "Triest"), [Istria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism_in_Istria "Italian irredentism in Istria"), and other adjacent territories as well. This Italian irredentism succeeded in [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") with the annexation of Trieste and [Trento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento "Trento"), with the respective territories of [Julian March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_March "Julian March") and [Trentino-Alto Adige](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol "Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol").

The Kingdom of Italy had declared neutrality at the beginning of the war, officially because the [Triple Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Alliance_\(1882\) "Triple Alliance (1882)") with Germany and Austria-Hungary was a defensive one, requiring its members to come under attack first. Many Italians were still hostile to Austria's continuing occupation of ethnically Italian areas, and Italy chose not to enter. [Austria-Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary") requested Italian neutrality, while the [Triple Entente](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente "Triple Entente") (which included Great Britain, France and Russia) requested its intervention. With the [Treaty of London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_\(1915\) "Treaty of London (1915)"), signed in April 1915, Italy agreed to declare war against the [Central Powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers") in exchange for the *irredent* territories of Friuli, Trentino, and [Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism_in_Dalmatia "Italian irredentism in Dalmatia") (see *[Italia irredenta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_irredenta "Italia irredenta")*).

Map of the three Italian provinces of the [Governorate of Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorate_of_Dalmatia "Governorate of Dalmatia") (1941–1943): [province of Zara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Zara "Province of Zara"), [province of Spalato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalato_\(Italian_province\) "Spalato (Italian province)") and [province of Cattaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Cattaro "Province of Cattaro")

Italian irredentism obtained an important result after the First World War, when Italy gained [Trieste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste "Trieste"), [Gorizia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorizia "Gorizia"), [Istria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria "Istria"), and the cities of [Zara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar "Zadar") and [Pola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pula "Pula") after the [Treaty of Rapallo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rapallo_\(1920\) "Treaty of Rapallo (1920)") in 1920. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing to that time, which is the view presented at the [Central Museum of the Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Museum_of_the_Risorgimento "Central Museum of the Risorgimento") at [Altare della Patria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altare_della_Patria "Altare della Patria") in Rome.[^5] [^6] But Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, such Dalmatia, so this outcome was denounced as a " [mutilated victory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_victory "Mutilated victory") ". The rhetoric of "mutilated victory" was adopted by [Benito Mussolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") and led to the [rise of](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_\(1922%E2%80%931943\) "Fascist Italy (1922–1943)") [Italian Fascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Fascism "Italian Fascism"), becoming a key point in the [propaganda of Fascist Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_Fascist_Italy "Propaganda of Fascist Italy"). Historians regard "mutilated victory" as a "political myth", used by fascists to fuel [Italian imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_imperialism "Italian imperialism") and obscure the successes of [liberal Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Italy "Liberal Italy") in the aftermath of World War I.[^115]

During the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), after the Axis attack on [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia"), Italy created the [Governatorate of Dalmatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governatorate_of_Dalmatia "Governatorate of Dalmatia") (from 1941 to September 1943), so the Kingdom of Italy annexed temporarily [Split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia "Split, Croatia") (Italian *Spalato*), [Kotor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotor "Kotor") (*Cattaro*), and most of coastal Dalmatia. From 1942 to 1943, [Corsica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism_in_Corsica "Italian irredentism in Corsica") and [Nice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism_in_Nice "Italian irredentism in Nice") (Italian *Nizza*) were temporarily annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, nearly fulfilling in those years the ambitions of Italian irredentism.

For its avowed purpose, the movement had the "emancipation" of all Italian lands still subject to foreign rule after Italian unification. The Irredentists took language as the test of the alleged Italian nationality of the countries they proposed to emancipate, which were [Trentino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino "Trentino"), Trieste, Dalmatia, Istria, Gorizia, [Ticino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticino "Ticino"), Nice (Nizza), Corsica, and [Malta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism_in_Malta "Italian irredentism in Malta"). Austria-Hungary promoted [Croatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats "Croats") interests in Dalmatia and Istria to weaken Italian claims in the western [Balkans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans "Balkans") before the First World War.[^116]

[Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians") leave [Pola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pula "Pula") in 1947 during the [Istrian-Dalmatian exodus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian-Dalmatian_exodus "Istrian-Dalmatian exodus").

Under the [Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Peace_with_Italy,_1947 "Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947"), [Istria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria "Istria"), [Kvarner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvarner_Gulf "Kvarner Gulf"), most of the [Julian March](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_March "Julian March") as well as the [Dalmatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia") city of [Zara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar "Zadar") was annexed by [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia") causing the [Istrian-Dalmatian exodus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian-Dalmatian_exodus "Istrian-Dalmatian exodus"), which led to the emigration of between 230,000 and 350,000 of local ethnic [Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians") ([Istrian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrian_Italians "Istrian Italians") and [Dalmatian Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_Italians "Dalmatian Italians")), the others being ethnic Slovenians, ethnic Croatians, and ethnic [Istro-Romanians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istro-Romanians "Istro-Romanians"), choosing to maintain Italian citizenship.[^117]

The Istrian-Dalmatian exodus started in 1943 and ended completely only in 1960. According to the census organized in [Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia "Croatia") in 2001 and that organized in [Slovenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia "Slovenia") in 2002, the Italians who remained in the former [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia "Yugoslavia") amounted to 21,894 people (2,258 in Slovenia and 19,636 in Croatia).[^118] [^119]

After World War II, [Italian irredentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism "Italian irredentism") disappeared along with the defeated Fascists and the Monarchy of the [House of Savoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy "House of Savoy"). After the Treaty of Paris (1947) and the [Treaty of Osimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Osimo "Treaty of Osimo") (1975), all territorial claims were abandoned by the [Italian Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Republic "Italian Republic") (see [Foreign relations of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Italy "Foreign relations of Italy")).[^120] The Italian irredentist movement thus vanished from Italian politics. The 1947 [Constitution of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy "Constitution of Italy") established five autonomous regions ([Sardinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia "Sardinia"), [Friuli-Venezia Giulia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli-Venezia_Giulia "Friuli-Venezia Giulia"), [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily"), [Aosta Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aosta_Valley "Aosta Valley"), and [Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol "Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol")), in recognition of their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness.

The [Victor Emmanuel II Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II_Monument "Victor Emmanuel II Monument") in Rome, inaugurated in 1911 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unification of Italy

Italy celebrates the [anniversary of the unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_of_the_unification_of_Italy "Anniversary of the unification of Italy") every fifty years, on 17 March (the date of [proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Kingdom_of_Italy "Proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy")). The anniversary occurred in 1911 (50th), 1961 (100th), 2011 (150th) and 2021 (160th) with several celebrations throughout the country.[^121] While remaining a working day, 17 March is considered a "day promoting the values linked to national identity".[^122]

The [National Unity and Armed Forces Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Unity_and_Armed_Forces_Day "National Unity and Armed Forces Day"), celebrated on 4 November, commemorates the end of World War I with the [Armistice of Villa Giusti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Villa_Giusti "Armistice of Villa Giusti"), a war event considered to complete the process of unification of Italy.[^123]

Mourning [Italia turrita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_turrita "Italia turrita") on the tomb to Vittorio Alfieri by [Antonio Canova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Canova "Antonio Canova")

In art, this period was characterised by the [Neoclassicism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism "Neoclassicism") that draws inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [Ancient Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") or [Ancient Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"). The main Italian sculptor was [Antonio Canova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Canova "Antonio Canova") who became famous for his [marble sculptures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_sculpture "Marble sculpture") that delicately rendered [nude](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity "Nudity") flesh. The mourning [Italia turrita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_turrita "Italia turrita") on the tomb to [Vittorio Alfieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Alfieri "Vittorio Alfieri") is one of the main works of Risorgimento by Canova. By this time, in sculpture, a veiled woman in the style of the [Veiled Rebecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veiled_Rebecca "Veiled Rebecca") of Benzoni had become an allegory for [Italian unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification "Italian unification").[^124]

[Francesco Hayez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Hayez "Francesco Hayez") was another remarkable artist of this period whose works often contain allegories about Italian unification. His most known painting *[The Kiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_\(Hayez\) "The Kiss (Hayez)")* aims to portray the spirit of the [Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risorgimento "Risorgimento"): the man wears red, white and green, representing the Italian patriots fighting for independence from the [Austro-Hungarian empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_empire "Austro-Hungarian empire") while the girl's pale blue dress signifies France, which in 1859 (the year of the painting's creation) made an alliance with the [Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Kingdom_of_Sardinia_\(1720%E2%80%931861\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861) (page does not exist)") enabling the latter to unify the many states of the Italian peninsula into the new kingdom of Italy. Hayez's three paintings on the *[Sicilian Vespers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Vespers "Sicilian Vespers")* are an implicit protest against the foreign domination of Italy.

[Andrea Appiani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Appiani "Andrea Appiani"), [Domenico Induno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Induno "Domenico Induno"), and [Gerolamo Induno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Induno "Gerolamo Induno") are also known for their patriotic canvases. The Risorgimento was also represented by works not necessarily linked to Neoclassicism—as in the case of [Giovanni Fattori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Fattori "Giovanni Fattori") who was one of the leaders of the group known as the [Macchiaioli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macchiaioli "Macchiaioli") and who soon became a leading Italian [plein-airist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_plein_air "En plein air"), painting landscapes, rural scenes, and military life during the Italian unification.[^125]

[Alessandro Manzoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni "Alessandro Manzoni") is famous for the novel *[The Betrothed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Betrothed_\(Manzoni_novel\) "The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)")* (1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of world literature.[^126] He contributed to the nationwide use of the Italian language.[^127]

The most well known writer of Risorgimento is [Alessandro Manzoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni "Alessandro Manzoni"), whose works are a symbol of the Italian unification, both for its patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified [Italian language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"). He is famous for the novel *[The Betrothed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Betrothed_\(Manzoni_novel\) "The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)")* (orig. Italian: *I Promessi Sposi*) (1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of [world literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_literature "World literature").

[Vittorio Alfieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Alfieri "Vittorio Alfieri"), was the founder of a new school in the Italian drama, expressed in several occasions his suffering about the foreign domination's tyranny.

[Ugo Foscolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Foscolo "Ugo Foscolo") describes in his works the passion and love for the fatherland and the glorious history of the [Italian people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people "Italian people"); these two concepts are respectively well expressed in two masterpieces, *[The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Letters_of_Jacopo_Ortis "The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis")* and *[Dei Sepolcri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dei_Sepolcri "Dei Sepolcri")*.

[Vincenzo Monti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Monti "Vincenzo Monti"), known for the [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") translation of the *[Iliad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad "Iliad")*, described in his works both enthusiasms and disappointments of Risorgimento until his death.

[Giovanni Berchet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Berchet "Giovanni Berchet") wrote a poetry characterized by a high moral, popular and social content; he also contributed to *[Il Conciliatore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Conciliatore "Il Conciliatore")*, a progressive bi-weekly scientific and literary journal, influential in the early [Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risorgimento "Risorgimento") that was published in [Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan") from September 1818 until October 1819 when it was closed by the Austrian censors; its writers included also [Ludovico di Breme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_di_Breme "Ludovico di Breme"), [Giuseppe Nicolini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Nicolini_\(writer\) "Giuseppe Nicolini (writer)"), and [Silvio Pellico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Pellico "Silvio Pellico").

[Giacomo Leopardi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi "Giacomo Leopardi") was one of the most important poets of Risorgimento thanks to works such as *[Canzone all'Italia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi#First_Canti "Giacomo Leopardi")* and *[Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi#Il_Risorgimento "Giacomo Leopardi")*.

Portrait of [Francesco De Sanctis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_De_Sanctis "Francesco De Sanctis") (1890) by [Francesco Saverio Altamura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Saverio_Altamura "Francesco Saverio Altamura")

[Niccolò Tommaseo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Tommaseo "Niccolò Tommaseo"), the editor of the *Italian Language Dictionary* in eight volumes, was a precursor of the [Italian irredentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_irredentism "Italian irredentism") and his works are a rare examples of a metropolitan culture above nationalism; he supported the liberal revolution headed by [Daniele Manin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Manin "Daniele Manin") against the [Austrian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire") and he will always support the unification of Italy.

[Francesco de Sanctis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_de_Sanctis "Francesco de Sanctis") was one of the most important scholars of Italian language and literature in the 19th century; he supported the [Revolution of 1848](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848_in_the_Italian_states "Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states") in [Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "Naples") and for this reason he was imprisoned for three years; his reputation as a lecturer on [Dante](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante "Dante") in [Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin") brought him the appointment of professor at [ETH Zürich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Z%C3%BCrich "ETH Zürich") in 1856; he returned to [Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "Naples") as Minister of Public Education after the unification of Italy.

The writer and patriot [Luigi Settembrini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Settembrini "Luigi Settembrini") published anonymously the *Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies*, a scathing indictment of the Bourbon government and was imprisoned and exiled several times by the Bourbons because of his support to Risorgimento; after the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, he was appointed professor of [Italian literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_literature "Italian literature") at the [University of Naples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Naples "University of Naples").

[Ippolito Nievo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippolito_Nievo "Ippolito Nievo") is another main representative of Risorgimento with his novel *[Confessioni d'un italiano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippolito_Nievo "Ippolito Nievo")*; he fought with [Giuseppe Garibaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi "Giuseppe Garibaldi") 's [Expedition of the Thousand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_of_the_Thousand "Expedition of the Thousand").

The Risorgimento was also depicted in famous novels: *[The Leopard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard "The Leopard")* written by [Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Tomasi_di_Lampedusa "Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa"), *[Heart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_\(novel\) "Heart (novel)")* by [Edmondo De Amicis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmondo_De_Amicis "Edmondo De Amicis"), and *[The Little World of the Past](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_World_of_the_Past "The Little World of the Past")* by [Antonio Fogazzaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Fogazzaro "Antonio Fogazzaro").[^128]

[Verdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdi "Verdi") 's bust outside the [Teatro Massimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Massimo "Teatro Massimo") in Palermo

Risorgimento won the support of many leading Italian opera composers.[^129] Their librettos often saw a delicate balance between European romantic narratives and dramatic themes evoking nationalistic sentiments. Ideas expressed in operas stimulated the political mobilisation in Italy and among the cultured classes of Europe who appreciated Italian opera. Furthermore, Mazzini and many other nationalists found inspiration in musical discourses.[^130]

In his *[L'italiana in Algeri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27italiana_in_Algeri "L'italiana in Algeri")* ('The Italian Girl in Algiers'), [Gioachino Rossini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini "Gioachino Rossini") expressed his support to the unification of Italy; the patriotic line *Pensa alla patria, e intrepido il tuo dover adempi: vedi per tutta Italia rinascere gli esempi d’ardir e di valor* ('Think about the fatherland and intrepid do your duty: see for all Italy the birth of the examples of courage and value') was censored in the [Kingdom of Two Sicilies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Two_Sicilies "Kingdom of Two Sicilies").

[Vincenzo Bellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Bellini "Vincenzo Bellini") was a secret member of the Carbonari and in his masterpiece *[I puritani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_puritani "I puritani") (The Puritans)*, the last part of Act 2 is an allegory to Italian unification. Another Bellini opera, *[Norma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_\(opera\) "Norma (opera)")*, was at the center of an unexpected standing ovation during its performance in [Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan") in 1859: while the [chorus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir "Choir") was performing *Guerra, guerra! Le galliche selve* ('War, war! The Gallic forests') in Act 2, the Italians began to greet the chorus with loud applause and to yell the word *War!* several times towards the [Austrian officers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire") at the [opera house](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_house "Opera house").[^131]

The relationship between [Gaetano Donizetti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Donizetti "Gaetano Donizetti") and the Risorgimento is still controversial. Although [Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini "Giuseppe Mazzini") tried to use some of Donizetti's works for promoting the Italian cause, Donizetti had always preferred not to get involved in politics.[^132]

Patriots scrawling "Viva VERDI" on walls

Historians vigorously debate how political were the operas of [Giuseppe Verdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi "Giuseppe Verdi") (1813–1901). In particular, the chorus of the Hebrew slaves (known as " [Va, pensiero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va,_pensiero "Va, pensiero") ") from the third act of the opera *[Nabucco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabucco "Nabucco")* was intended to be an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus's theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines such as *O mia patria, si bella e perduta—'O my country, so lovely and so lost'—were thought to have resonated with many Italians).[^133] Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan "Viva VERDI" was used as an acronym for* **Viva V** ittorio **E** manuele **R** e ***D** ' **I** talia (' [Viva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vive,_Viva "Vive, Viva") Victor Emmanuel King of Italy'), referring to [Victor Emmanuel II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy "Victor Emmanuel II of Italy").[^134] [^135]*

Franco Della Peruta argues in favour of close links between the operas and the Risorgimento, emphasizing Verdi's patriotic intent and links to the values of the Risorgimento. Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of Cavour and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour's suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors. Verdi's main works of 1842–49 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including *Nabucco* (1842), *[I Lombardi alla prima crociata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Lombardi_alla_prima_crociata "I Lombardi alla prima crociata")* (1843), *[Ernani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernani "Ernani")* (1844), *[Attila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila_\(opera\) "Attila (opera)")* (1846), *[Macbeth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_\(Verdi\) "Macbeth (Verdi)")* (1847), and *[La battaglia di Legnano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_battaglia_di_Legnano "La battaglia di Legnano")* (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship of the absolutist regimes in power.

Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861.[^136] Likewise Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815 music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo says Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles.[^137] On the other side of the debate, [Mary Ann Smart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ann_Smart "Mary Ann Smart") argues that music critics at the time seldom mentioned any political themes.[^138] Likewise [Roger Parker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Parker "Roger Parker") argues that the political dimension of Verdi's operas was exaggerated by nationalistic historians looking for a hero in the late 19th century.[^139]

The final scene of the opera *Risorgimento!* (2011) by [Lorenzo Ferrero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ferrero "Lorenzo Ferrero")

Giuseppe Verdi's *Nabucco* and the Risorgimento are the subject of a 2011 opera, *[Risorgimento!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risorgimento!_\(opera\) "Risorgimento! (opera)")* by Italian composer [Lorenzo Ferrero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ferrero "Lorenzo Ferrero"), written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Italian unification.

*[The Leopard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard_\(1963_film\) "The Leopard (1963 film)")* is a film from 1963, based on the novel by [Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Tomasi_di_Lampedusa "Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa"), and directed by [Luchino Visconti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchino_Visconti "Luchino Visconti"). It features [Burt Lancaster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster "Burt Lancaster") as the eponymous character, the Prince of Salina. The film depicts his reaction to the Risorgimento, and his vain attempts to retain his social standing.

Entrance to the Central Museum of the Risorgimento from via di San Pietro in Carcere in [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome")

Inside the [Altare della Patria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altare_della_Patria "Altare della Patria") in [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") are some museums dedicated to the [history of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Italy "History of Italy"), especially the Unification of Italy: the Central Museum of the Risorgimento ([Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): *Museo Centrale del Risorgimento*) with an adjoining study institute, the [Flag of Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy "Flag of Italy") Memorial ([Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): *Sacrario delle bandiere*) and an area that hosts temporary exhibitions of artistic interest, historical, sociological and cultural called "ala Brasini".[^140] [^141]

Since 2020, together with [Palazzo Venezia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_nazionale_del_Palazzo_di_Venezia "Museo nazionale del Palazzo di Venezia"), it has been managed by the VIVE Institute, one of the eleven institutes of significant general interest of the [Italian Ministry of Culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Ministry_of_Culture "Italian Ministry of Culture").[^142]

On the entrance stairway of the Central Museum of the Risorgimento are visible engravings related to some significant episodes for the birth of the Risorgimento movement, from the seed thrown by the [French Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution") to the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), to better frame and remember the national history included between the reform of the [ancient Italian states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historic_states_of_Italy "List of historic states of Italy") and the end of the First World War. Along the walls, other marble engravings show some pieces of texts enunciated by prominent personalities, which better testify and describe this part of Italian history.[^144] [^147]

The Central Museum of the Risorgimento also includes the Shrine of the Flags, a museum where the [war flags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_flag "War flag") of dissolved military units and decommissioned ships from the [Italian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Army "Italian Army"), [Italian Air Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Air_Force "Italian Air Force"), [Italian Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Navy "Italian Navy"), [Carabinieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabinieri "Carabinieri"), *[Polizia di Stato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polizia_di_Stato "Polizia di Stato")*, Penitentiary Police and *[Guardia di Finanza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardia_di_Finanza "Guardia di Finanza")* are collected and temporarily stored. In case a unit is reformed, the flags are retrieved by the unit.[^141] Access to the shrine is along [Via dei Fori Imperiali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_dei_Fori_Imperiali "Via dei Fori Imperiali"), where memorabilia, relating mainly to the Risorgimento wars, in which the [Italian Armed Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Armed_Forces "Italian Armed Forces") took part, are also kept.[^148]

The "ala Brasini", reserved for temporary exhibitions, is dedicated to [Armando Brasini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_Brasini "Armando Brasini"), the main promoter of the Central Museum. The wing has three exhibition rooms: the "large exhibition hall", with a surface area of 700 m <sup>2</sup> (7,535 sq ft), generally hosts art exhibitions, and those that require more space, the "central hall" of 400 m <sup>2</sup> (4,306 sq ft) and the "jubilee hall" of 150 m <sup>2</sup> (1,615 sq ft), are used.[^149]

The National Museum of the Italian Risorgimento in [Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin")

The [National Museum of the Italian Risorgimento of Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_the_Risorgimento_\(Turin\) "Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)") is the first, the biggest and the most important among the 23 museums in Italy dedicated to the [Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risorgimento "Risorgimento"); and the only one which can be considered "national" according to a 1901 law, and due to its rich and great collections. It is housed in the [Palazzo Carignano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Carignano "Palazzo Carignano") in [Turin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin").

The museum was established in 1878, shortly after [Italian unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification "Italian unification"), even though it only had its first permanent exhibition in 1908. Originally located in the [Mole Antonelliana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_Antonelliana "Mole Antonelliana"), in 1938 it was moved to its current site (which had previously housed the Subalpine Chamber of Deputies, from 1848 to 1860, and then the first Italian Chamber of Deputies, from 1861 to 1865).

Its exhibits include weapons, flags, uniforms, printed and written documents (including the original manuscript of the song *[Il Canto degli Italiani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Canto_degli_Italiani "Il Canto degli Italiani")*, dated 10 November 1847 by Goffredo Mameli, now Italian national anthem since 1946), and artworks. The new exhibition, which opened on 18 March 2011, occupies about 3500 square metres across 30 rooms, and covers the real Risorgimento period, stretching from the late 18th century revolutions to the beginning of the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"). It includes a specialized library, a print cabinet and a documentary archive.

The Museum of the Risorgimento of [Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan")

The [Museum of the Risorgimento of Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_the_Risorgimento_\(Milan\) "Museum of the Risorgimento (Milan)"), located in the 18th-century [Milanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan") Palazzo Moriggia, houses a collection of objects and artworks which illustrate the history of [Italian unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification "Italian unification") from Napoleon's [Italian campaign of 1796](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_campaign_of_1796 "Italian campaign of 1796") to the [annexation of Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Rome "Capture of Rome") in 1870. The city of Milan played a key role in the process, most notably on the occasion of the 1848 uprising against the Austrians known as the [Five Days of Milan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Days_of_Milan "Five Days of Milan").

The museum was founded on a collection of documents on the [Risorgimento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risorgimento "Risorgimento"), gathered for the Exhibition of Turin in 1884 and then moved to the showroom at Milan’s Public Gardens. The exhibition was later transferred to the Rocchetta rooms at the [Sforza Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sforza_Castle "Sforza Castle"), where it was officially inaugurated on 24 June 1896. In 1943, due to the war-time bombardment of the castle, the museum was temporarily moved to the estate of [Casa Manzoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Manzoni "Casa Manzoni") (home of the famed Italian poet and novelist Alessandro Manzoni). Finally in 1951 it was housed inside the Moriggia Palace, where it remains today.[^150]

The museum is part of the Civic Historical Collections. Its collections include [Baldassare Verazzi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldassare_Verazzi "Baldassare Verazzi") 's *Episode from the Five Days* and [Francesco Hayez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Hayez "Francesco Hayez") 's 1840 *[Portrait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Francesco_Hayez_047.jpg "File:Francesco Hayez 047.jpg") of Emperor [Ferdinand I of Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_Austria "Ferdinand I of Austria")*. The permanent exhibition is displayed to follow the chronological order of events of the Risorgimento, leading the visitor through fifteen rooms, to which the new Weapons Room has been recently added. The latest refurbishment in 1998 included the redesign of the permanent exhibitions, to accentuate the highlights of the collections, particularly the relics.

The museum boasts the green-and-silver velvet cloak and the valuable regal insignia of Napoleon Bonaparte’s coronation, the banner of the Legione Lombarda Cacciatori a Cavallo (Lombard Legion on Horseback) and the first Italian flag. The last renovation saw the redesign of the lighting and information systems, as well as improvements to the ‘Romantic Garden’ behind the building.[^151]

Civic Museum of the Risorgimento of Bologna

The [Civic Museum of the Risorgimento pf Bologna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_the_Risorgimento,_Bologna "Museum of the Risorgimento, Bologna") is located in the ground floor of the Casa Carducci, located in Piazza Carducci 5, in central [Bologna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna "Bologna").

Prior to being a Museum, part of the site had housed the church of the Madonna della Pietà, known commonly as the Madonna del Piombo (Virgin Mary of the Lead). It was so named because it contained a relief of the Madonna etched on a lead plate, attributed to [Sperandio Savelli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sperandio_Savelli&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sperandio Savelli (page does not exist)"), that had gained veneration. There is also a legend that in the first years of the 16th century the icon had been discovered by youths playing here, near the city walls, and this led to the first chapel, then church.

This church burned down in 1712, but was soon replaced by a frescoed oratory completed in 1752. This oratory whose facade is represented by the three round arches with double central pilasters. After the [Napoleonic occupation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_campaigns_of_the_French_Revolutionary_Wars "Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars"), the members of the company who owned the oratory had the structure deconsecrated and the contents sold off to antiquarians. The oratory had been decorated by the artists [Antonio Rossi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Rossi_\(painter\) "Antonio Rossi (painter)"), [Ercole Graziani the Younger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ercole_Graziani_the_Younger "Ercole Graziani the Younger"), [Gaetano Ferratini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaetano_Ferratini&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gaetano Ferratini (page does not exist)"), [Giuseppe Orsoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Orsoni "Giuseppe Orsoni"), [Antonio Gionima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gionima "Antonio Gionima"), and [Lorenzo Garbieri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Garbieri "Lorenzo Garbieri").[^152]

A Bolognese Museum of the Risorgimento was first inaugurated on June 12, 1893. The museum has exhibits that chronicle the history from the [Napoleonic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic "Napoleonic") invasions to the end of the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"). The main exhibits are divided into 5 eras:

- The Napoleonic Era (1796-1814)
- The Restoration of [Papal States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States") (1815-1848)
- The Epic of the Risorgimento (1848-1860)
- The Unification of Italy (1860-1914)
- Bologna at War (1915-1918)

The Museum houses a library of documents and an archive of diverse items from the period. It houses the a project towards maintenance of the city's monumental cemetery at the [Certosa di Bologna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certosa_di_Bologna "Certosa di Bologna").

The museum has varied in scope and themes across the decades. The initial founding of the museum focused on the patriotic events leading to Italian sovereignty and union. During and after the First World War, this conflict was defined as the Fourth War of Independence. Fascism added to the focus, the ideals of a greater Italy, the aggressive colonial wars that led to the formation of [Italian East Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_East_Africa "Italian East Africa"), the Italian intervention in the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War"), and the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"). The museum first closed in 1943, and did not reopen until 1954. Fascist wars and goals were now removed as a focus, and the Resistance to Fascism was viewed as the Second Risorgimento. The museum closed again from 1962 to 1975, and now focuses on the history prior to the Italy's entry into World War II.

The museum was located in the present Casa Carducci premises only in 1990, and includes the premises of the oratory. The Casa Carducci was the last home of the poet [Giosuè Carducci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giosu%C3%A8_Carducci "Giosuè Carducci"), who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1906.[^153]

[Tricolour Flag Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolour_Flag_Museum "Tricolour Flag Museum")

The [Tricolour Flag Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolour_Flag_Museum "Tricolour Flag Museum") is located in [Reggio nell'Emilia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_nell%27Emilia "Reggio nell'Emilia"), the city that saw the birth of the [Italian flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy "Flag of Italy") in 1797, inside the town hall of the city, adjacent to the [Sala del Tricolore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sala_del_Tricolore "Sala del Tricolore"), whose collection is made up of relics related to the Italian flag.[^154]

The museum reconstructs the history of the [Italian flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy "Flag of Italy"), which was adopted in [Reggio Emilia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia "Reggio Emilia") for the first time, right in the nearby [Sala del Tricolore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sala_del_Tricolore "Sala del Tricolore"). On 7 January 1797 it was in fact chosen as the [national flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_flag "National flag") of the [Cispadane Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cispadane_Republic "Cispadane Republic"): for the first time the tricolour became the national flag of a sovereign Italian state. In fact, previously, the tricolour was used as a [war flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_flag "War flag") and as a civic symbol of local authorities. It was inspired by the [French flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_flag "French flag"), which at the time was a symbol of freedom against the states of the *[ancien régime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien_r%C3%A9gime "Ancien régime")*.

Inaugurated on 7 January 2004, it preserves documents, relics and Italian flags ranging from the arrival of [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte "Napoleon Bonaparte") in Reggio Emilia (1796) to its fall (1814), and others from the subsequent [Italian unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification "Italian unification") period. The part of the museum that houses the latter was inaugurated on 7 January 2006. The dating of the relics preserved goes back to 1897, the year of the first centenary of the Italian flag. There are also a large number of tricolor flags of the Italian pre-unification States.
