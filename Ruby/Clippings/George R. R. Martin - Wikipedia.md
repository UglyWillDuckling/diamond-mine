He is best known as the author of the series of [epic fantasy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy "High fantasy") novels *[A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire "A Song of Ice and Fire")*, which were adapted into the [Primetime Emmy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award "Primetime Emmy Award")–winning television series *[Game of Thrones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "Game of Thrones")* (2011–2019) and its prequel series *[House of the Dragon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon "House of the Dragon")* (2022–present). He also helped create the *[Wild Cards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards "Wild Cards")* anthology series and contributed [worldbuilding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding "Worldbuilding") for the video game *[Elden Ring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring "Elden Ring")* (2022).

In 2005, [Lev Grossman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Grossman "Lev Grossman") of *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* called Martin "the American [Tolkien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien")",[^time_american_tolkien-4][^wion2022-5][^lemmonds2013-6] and in 2011, he was included on the annual [*Time* 100](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100 "Time 100") list of the most influential people in the world.[^time100pat-7][^time100list-8] He is a longtime resident of [Santa Fe, New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico "Santa Fe, New Mexico"), where he helped fund [Meow Wolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meow_Wolf "Meow Wolf") and owns the [Jean Cocteau Cinema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau_Cinema "Jean Cocteau Cinema").[^nyt_santafe-9][^durchdienacht-10][^singhkurtz2019-11] The city commemorates March 29 as George R. R. Martin Day.[^garcia2022-12][^the_santa_fe_travel_insider_2014-13]

George Raymond Martin (he adopted the [confirmation name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_name "Confirmation name") *Richard* at 13 years old)[^confirmation-2] was born on September 20, 1948,[^14] in [Bayonne, New Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne,_New_Jersey "Bayonne, New Jersey"),[^15] the son of [longshoreman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dockworker "Dockworker") Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. His mother's family had once been wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"), something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family's dock and house.[^16] He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Jane. He is predominantly of [Irish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people "Irish people") descent;[^17] a DNA test on the series *[Finding Your Roots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Your_Roots "Finding Your Roots")* showed him to be 53.6% "British and Irish", 22.4% [Ashkenazi Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews "Ashkenazi Jews"), and 15.6% "Broadly Northwestern European".[^18][^19]

The family first lived in a house on Broadway belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal [housing project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_project "Housing project") near the [Bayonne docks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Park_\(Bayonne,_New_Jersey\) "Collins Park (Bayonne, New Jersey)").[^theheartofasmall-20] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his grade school and his home. This limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[^21]

Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He had to stop once a customer's mother complained about her child's nightmares.[^22] He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles — the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".[^berwick20120601-23] Martin had a habit of starting "endless stories" that he never completed, as they did not turn out as well on paper as he had imagined them.[^24]

Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later [Marist High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_High_School_\(New_Jersey\) "Marist High School (New Jersey)"). While there, he became an avid comic-book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by [Marvel Comics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics "Marvel Comics"),[^25] and later credited [Stan Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee "Stan Lee") for being one of his greatest literary influences; "Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien."[^26] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of *[Fantastic Four](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four "Fantastic Four")* was printed in issue #20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., *Fantastic Four* #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics [fandom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom "Fandom") of the era, writing fiction for various [fanzines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzines "Fanzines");[^dent20120612-27] he bought the first ticket to the world's first [Comic-Con](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_convention "Comic book convention"), held in New York in 1964.[^gustines20141003-28][^29] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's [Alley Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Award "Alley Award") for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story "Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier".[^30]

In 1970, Martin earned a [B.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "Bachelor of Science") in [journalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism "Journalism") with a minor in history from [Northwestern University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University "Northwestern University")'s [Medill School of Journalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medill_School_of_Journalism "Medill School of Journalism") in [Evanston, Illinois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois "Evanston, Illinois"), graduating *[summa cum laude](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_cum_laude "Summa cum laude")*; he went on to complete his [M.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill.[^d'mmassa_pages_388-390-31] Eligible for the [draft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States "Conscription in the United States") during the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), to which he [objected](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"), Martin applied for and obtained [conscientious objector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector "Conscientious objector") status;[^32] he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972–1974) as a [VISTA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriCorps_VISTA "AmeriCorps VISTA") volunteer, attached to the [Cook County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois "Cook County, Illinois") Legal Assistance Foundation.[^d'mmassa_pages_388-390-31]

### Early writing career

Martin began selling science fiction [short stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stories "Short stories") professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was "The Hero", sold to *[Galaxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Science_Fiction "Galaxy Science Fiction")* magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the [Hugo Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award "Hugo Award")[^33] and [Nebula Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award "Nebula Award") was "[With Morning Comes Mistfall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_Morning_Comes_Mistfall "With Morning Comes Mistfall")", published in 1973 in *[Analog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact "Analog Science Fiction and Fact")* magazine. In 1975 his story "...for a single yesterday" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in *[Epoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_\(anthology\) "Epoch (anthology)")*, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, *[Dying of the Light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_of_the_Light_\(Martin_novel\) "Dying of the Light (Martin novel)")*, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of *[Star Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_\(film\) "Star Wars (film)")* had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.[^34]

The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed [Bobby Fischer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer "Bobby Fischer")'s victory in the [1972 world chess championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_1972 "World Chess Championship 1972"). Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association, which ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. By the time the chess craze subsided and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.[^35][^36]

In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor [George Guthridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Guthridge "George Guthridge") from [Dubuque, Iowa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubuque,_Iowa "Dubuque, Iowa"), at a [science fiction convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_convention "Science fiction convention") in [Milwaukee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee "Milwaukee"). Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised [science fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") and [fantasy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy "Fantasy")) not only to give [speculative fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction "Speculative fiction") a second look, but also to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the [Nebula Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award "Nebula Award") for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the [Bram Stoker Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker_Award "Bram Stoker Award") for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their *Children of the Dusk*.[^37]

In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at [Clarke University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_University "Clarke University") (then Clarke College). Martin "wasn't making enough money to stay alive" from writing and the chess tournaments, said Guthridge.[^38] From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.

### Concentration on writing

While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author [Tom Reamy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Reamy "Tom Reamy") in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. In 1979 he resigned from his job and moved from Dubuque to [Santa Fe, New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico "Santa Fe, New Mexico") at the end of the year.[^40][^41] There he would live alone for almost three years, a period he described as tremendously productive in regard to writing.[^new_house-42]

Martin is a member of the [Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Writers_of_America "Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America") (SFWA); he served as the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998.[^prior-sfwa-board-43] In 1976, for Kansas City's [MidAmeriCon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidAmeriCon "MidAmeriCon"), the [34th World Science Fiction Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_World_Science_Fiction_Convention "34th World Science Fiction Convention") ([Worldcon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldcon "Worldcon")), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor [Gardner Dozois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner_Dozois "Gardner Dozois") conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the novella *The Storms of Windhaven*, co-written with [Lisa Tuttle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Tuttle "Lisa Tuttle").[^locusmag-44] Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined [future history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_history "Future history"), known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm".

In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered *[Sandkings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandkings_\(novelette\) "Sandkings (novelette)")* (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella *[Nightflyers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightflyers "Nightflyers")* (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, *[Nightflyers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightflyers_\(film\) "Nightflyers (film)")*, with a screenplay co-written by Martin.[^45] Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.[^npr2012-46] While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it.[^47] He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, "Night of the Vampyres", collected in [Harry Turtledove](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Turtledove "Harry Turtledove")'s anthology *The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century* (2001).[^48]

In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled *[Fevre Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fevre_Dream "Fevre Dream")* set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River, in the heyday of the great paddle steamers. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in *Fevre Dream* vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised *Fevre Dream* for its strong 19th-century atmosphere and wrote: "This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time".[^d'amassa_pages_388-390-49] Martin followed up *Fevre Dream* with another [horror novel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_novel "Horror novel"), *[The Armageddon Rag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Armageddon_Rag "The Armageddon Rag")* (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of *The Armageddon Rag* "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled, and made him consider going into [real estate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate "Real estate") instead.[^50]

In 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like [Solomon Kane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Kane "Solomon Kane"), [Elric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elric "Elric"), [Nicholas van Rijn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_van_Rijn "Nicholas van Rijn") and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel *Black and White and Red All Over*, which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of *The Armageddon Rag*, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in *[Tuf Voyaging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuf_Voyaging "Tuf Voyaging")*, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt *The Armageddon Rag* into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of *[The Twilight Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_\(1985_TV_series\) "The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)")*, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.[^berwick20120601-23][^51][^52] At first he worked as staff writer for the show, and then as an executive story consultant.

After the [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series [*Max Headroom*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_\(TV_series\) "Max Headroom (TV series)"). He worked on scripts and created the show's "Ped Xing" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the [ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company") show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series *[Beauty and the Beast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\(1987_TV_series\) "Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)")*; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.

In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in *[Portraits of His Children](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraits_of_His_Children "Portraits of His Children")*. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author *[Wild Cards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards "Wild Cards")* book series, which takes place in a [shared universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe "Shared universe") in which a small slice of post–[World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from [Tor Books](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Books "Tor Books"). In *Second Person*, Martin "gives a personal account of the close-knit [role-playing game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game "Role-playing game") (RPG) culture that gave rise to his *Wild Cards* shared-world anthologies".[^53] An important element in the creation of the multiple-author series was a campaign of [Chaosium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaosium "Chaosium")'s role-playing game *[Superworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superworld "Superworld")* (1983) that Martin ran in [Albuquerque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque "Albuquerque").[^designers-54] Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for most of 1983, which he refers to as his "lost year", but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in *Superworld* could somehow become profitable.[^55] Martin's own contributions to *Wild Cards* have included Thomas Tudbury, "[The Great and Powerful Turtle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_and_Powerful_Turtle "The Great and Powerful Turtle")", a powerful [psychokinetic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinetic "Psychokinetic") whose flying "shell" consisted of an armored [VW Beetle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/VW_Beetle "VW Beetle"). As of June 2011<sup class="plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update"><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_R._R._Martin&amp;action=edit">[update]</a></sup>, 21 *Wild Cards* volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, *Low Ball* (2014), published by [Tor Books](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Books "Tor Books"). In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd *Wild Cards* volume, *High Stakes*, which was released in August 2016.[^highstakes-56]

In August 2016, Martin announced that [Universal Cable Productions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Cable_Productions "Universal Cable Productions") had acquired the rights to adapt the *Wild Cards* novels into a television series.[^george_r._r._martin-57] He noted that he himself would not write for the adaptation due to focusing on *A Song of Ice and Fire*.[^george_r._r._martin-57]

In 2014, Martin said in a [BBC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") interview that he writes using [WordStar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar "WordStar") [editor software](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor"), on an [MS-DOS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS") [computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), because he dislikes having his work [spell-checked](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker "Spell checker") and to avoid [internet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") distractions. He uses a separate computer for common internet tasks.[^58]

### *A Song of Ice and Fire*

 Teaching at [Clarion West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_West "Clarion West"), 1998

In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made[^grrm_iv_januarymagazine-59] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[^nytimes_twisted-60] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising his imagination.[^grrm_iv_januarymagazine-59] Admiring the works of [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien") in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[^grmm_iv_ew-61]

His epic fantasy series, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, was inspired by the [Wars of the Roses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses "Wars of the Roses"), *[The Accursed Kings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accursed_Kings "The Accursed Kings")*[^62] and *[Ivanhoe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe "Ivanhoe")*. Though Martin originally conceptualized it as being three volumes,[^63] it is currently slated to comprise seven. The first, *[A Game of Thrones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones "A Game of Thrones")*, was published in 1996, followed by *[A Clash of Kings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clash_of_Kings "A Clash of Kings")* in 1998 and *[A Storm of Swords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Storm_of_Swords "A Storm of Swords")* in 2000. In November 2005, *[A Feast for Crows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows "A Feast for Crows")*, the fourth novel in this series, became *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* No. 1 Bestseller.[^nyt-2005nov27-64] The fifth book, *[A Dance with Dragons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons "A Dance with Dragons")*, was published July 12, 2011, and became an international bestseller, including achieving a No. 1 spot on the [*New York Times* Bestseller List](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list "The New York Times Best Seller list")[^nyt-2011jul31-65] and many others; it remained on the *New York Times* list for 88 weeks.

In 2012, *A Dance with Dragons* made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy's Hugo Award,[^tha-2012-66] World Fantasy Award,[^tb-2012nov04-67] Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award;[^bfs-2012may07-68] the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[^lm-2012jun16-69] Two more novels are planned in the series: *[The Winds of Winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter "The Winds of Winter")* and the final volume *[A Dream of Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dream_of_Spring "A Dream of Spring")*.

On April 25, 2018, Martin announced the release date of his new book, *[Fire & Blood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_\(book\) "Fire & Blood (book)")*, dealing with the history of House Targaryen, which was released on November 20, 2018.[^70] Should Martin die before finishing the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, former collaborators have said that they will not conclude the series for him.[^71]

#### HBO adaptation of *A Song of Ice and Fire*

[HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") Productions purchased the television rights for the *[A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire "A Song of Ice and Fire")* series in 2007. Although busy completing *[A Dance with Dragons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons "A Dance with Dragons")* and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The original pilot was shot between October 24 and November 19, 2009, on location in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Morocco.[^72] It was received so poorly by HBO executives that they did not make a decision for four months after the pilot was delivered.[^73] In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series was announced,[^74] with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010.[^75] HBO however demanded the first episode be reshot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped.[^76] The first episode ("[Winter Is Coming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming "Winter Is Coming")") premiered on HBO in the United States and Canada on April 17, 2011. It was seen initially by 2.2 million viewers. The first season was nominated for 13 [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards"), ultimately winning two: one for its [opening title credits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_title_sequence "Game of Thrones title sequence"), and one for [Peter Dinklage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage "Peter Dinklage") as Best Supporting Actor.[^:3-77]

HBO ordered a second season of *Game of Thrones* on April 19, 2011, two days after the series premiere.[^78] The second season obtained a 15% increase in budget in order to be able to stage the war's most important battle,[^79] the Battle of the Blackwater, in episode nine which was written by George R. R. Martin. Filming took place during 106 shooting days. During three-quarters of those, two crews ("Dragon" and "Wolf") were working simultaneously in different locations.[^80] [Alan Taylor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Taylor_\(director\) "Alan Taylor (director)") was promoted to co-executive producer and directed four episodes, including the season premiere and finale. [David Petrarca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Petrarca "David Petrarca") and [David Nutter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nutter "David Nutter") each directed two episodes, while series cinematographer [Alik Sakharov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alik_Sakharov "Alik Sakharov") and filmmaker [Neil Marshall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Marshall "Neil Marshall") directed the remaining two. The second season premiered in the United States on [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") on April 1, 2012, and concluded on June 3, 2012. U.S. viewership rose by approximately 8% over the course of the season, from 3.9 million to 4.2 million by the season finale. The second season won six of the twelve [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") for which it was nominated.[^:3-77]

*[Game of Thrones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "Game of Thrones")* rapidly became a critical and commercial success after the second season. HBO renewed the series for a [third season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_season_3 "Game of Thrones season 3") on April 10, 2012, nine days after the [second season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_season_2 "Game of Thrones season 2")'s premiere. Production began in July 2012[^81] and concluded with the [wrap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrap_\(filmmaking\) "Wrap (filmmaking)") of the unit filming in Iceland on November 24, 2012. The third season is based on the first half of the novel *[A Storm of Swords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Storm_of_Swords "A Storm of Swords")*. Benioff had previously said that *A Storm of Swords* would need to be adapted in two seasons on account of its length. Benioff and Weiss also noted that they thought of *Game of Thrones* as an adaptation of the series as a whole, rather than of individual novels, which gave them the liberty to move scenes back and forth across novels according to the requirements of the screen adaptation.[^82] Season 3 saw the first significant use of the [Valyrian languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyrian_languages "Valyrian languages"), spoken in doomed [Valyria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyria "Valyria") and its former colonies in [Essos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essos "Essos"). The [constructed languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language") were developed by linguist [David J. Peterson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Peterson "David J. Peterson") based on the few words Martin invented for the novels. Peterson had previously developed the [Dothraki language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothraki_language "Dothraki language"), used principally in season 1.[^83] The third season premiered on [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") on March 31, 2013, and concluded on June 9, 2013. The third season was seen by 14.2 million viewers.[^84] It won 2 of the 16 [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") for which it was nominated.[^:3-77]

Two days after third-season premiere, HBO ordered the fourth season on April 2, 2013, which began filming in July 2013.[^85] The season is adapted primarily from the second half of *[A Storm of Swords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Storm_of_Swords "A Storm of Swords")*, along with elements of *[A Feast for Crows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows "A Feast for Crows")* and *[A Dance with Dragons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons "A Dance with Dragons").* [Showrunners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner") [David Benioff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benioff "David Benioff") and [D. B. Weiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._B._Weiss "D. B. Weiss") co-wrote seven out of ten episodes. The remaining three episodes were written by [Bryan Cogman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cogman "Bryan Cogman") (two episodes), and George R. R. Martin (one episode). For this season, the filming lasted 136 days and was completed on November 21, 2013.[^86] The [fourth season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_season_4 "Game of Thrones season 4") premiered in the United States on [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") on April 6, 2014, and concluded on June 15, 2014. The season was met with largely positive reviews. It won 4 of the 19 [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") for which it was nominated.[^:3-77] With its fourth season, *Game of Thrones* has become the most-watched HBO series in history (surpassing the fourth season of *[The Sopranos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos "The Sopranos")* which had a gross audience of 18.2 million viewers), averaging 18.4 million viewers across multiple platforms, including live viewing, encores, DVR views, HBO GO and On Demand views.[^87]

Up until the fourth season, Martin wrote one episode for each season. In 2022, Martin said that he had been estranged from the show during the production process of the last 4 seasons (starting with season 5).[^:2-88] In the early seasons, Martin wrote and read scripts, consulted on casting decisions and visited sets. Over time, however, he stepped back to focus on his long-delayed next "Thrones" novel, *[The Winds of Winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter "The Winds of Winter")*.[^:2-88] Following the gargantuan success of the fourth season, HBO ordered the fifth season on April 8, 2014, together with the [sixth season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_season_6 "Game of Thrones season 6"), which began filming in July 2014. The season primarily adapts the storylines from *[A Feast for Crows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows "A Feast for Crows")* and *[A Dance with Dragons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons "A Dance with Dragons"),* also with original content not found in Martin's novels. This season set a [Guinness World Record](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records "Guinness World Records") for winning the highest number of [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including [Outstanding Drama Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Drama_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series").[^89]

With a budget over $100 million for the whole season, filming for the sixth season began in July 2015 and ended on December. The season filmed in five different countries: [Northern Ireland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland "Northern Ireland"), [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"), [Croatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia "Croatia"), [Iceland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland"), and [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"). This season saw the overall plot of the show diverging from the source material. Some of the season's storyline is derived from content not yet published in Martin's *[A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire "A Song of Ice and Fire")* series, although a significant amount of material from *[A Feast for Crows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows "A Feast for Crows")*, *[A Dance with Dragons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons "A Dance with Dragons")* and the upcoming sixth novel *[The Winds of Winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter "The Winds of Winter")*, which Martin previously outlined to [showrunners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner") [David Benioff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benioff "David Benioff") and [D.B. Weiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.B._Weiss "D.B. Weiss"), was used.[^90] The season was largely met with positive reviews.[^91] The "[Battle of the Bastards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bastards "Battle of the Bastards")" episode received immense critical acclaim, with many calling it one of the best television episodes of all time.[^92] U.S. viewership rose compared to the previous season, and by approximately 13 percent over its course, from 7.9 million to 8.9 million by the finale. The season won 12 of the 23 [Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") for which it was nominated.[^:3-77]

Three days before the premiere of the episode "[The Red Woman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Woman "The Red Woman")", HBO ordered the seventh season. Due to necessary weather conditions required for filming, the production of the penultimate season of the show was delayed that year.[^93] Filming began only on August 31, 2016, at Titanic Studios in Belfast,[^94] and ended in February 2017.[^95] Unlike previous seasons, the seventh and eighth seasons largely consisted of original content not found in the source material. This season comprised only seven episodes. The showrunners stated that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the show's usual 12 to 14 month time frame, as Weiss said "It's crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule".[^96] The average runtime of an episode in this season was approximately 63 minutes. The series received 22 nominations for the [70th Primetime Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/70th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards "70th Primetime Emmy Awards") and won 9 of them, including "Outstanding Drama Series".[^97]

Unlike its prior seasons, the final one took a year gap for its production and filming. The eighth season consisted of only six episodes, though the average runtime of an episode was 68 minutes, the longest of all seasons, with ["The Long Night"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Night_\(Game_of_Thrones\) "The Long Night (Game of Thrones)") consisting of 81 minutes. The season was met with mixed reviews from critics. While the performances, production values and music score were praised, criticism was mainly directed at the shorter runtime of the season as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners. Many commentators deemed it to be a disappointing conclusion to the series. Despite this, the season received 32 nominations at the [71st Primetime Emmy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_Primetime_Emmy_Awards "71st Primetime Emmy Awards"), the most for a single season of television in history, and won twelve, including [Outstanding Drama Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Drama_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series") and [Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Supporting_Actor_in_a_Drama_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series") for [Peter Dinklage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage "Peter Dinklage").[^98]

Three years after the show ended, a [prequel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel "Prequel") series, *[House of the Dragon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon "House of the Dragon")*, premiered on HBO on August 21, 2022. Based on parts of the novel *[Fire & Blood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_\(novel\) "Fire & Blood (novel)")*, the series is set about 200 years before the events of *[Game of Thrones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "Game of Thrones").* [Ryan Condal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Condal "Ryan Condal") and [Miguel Sapochnik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Sapochnik "Miguel Sapochnik") served as the [showrunners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner") for the first season. Five days after its premiere, the [series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon "House of the Dragon") was renewed for a second season by [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO"). On September 1, Sapochnik departed as showrunner,[^99] with another veteran [Game of Thrones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "Game of Thrones") director [Alan Taylor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Taylor_\(director\) "Alan Taylor (director)") replacing him as the co-showrunner for the upcoming second season.[^100]

In June 2022, it was reported that a Jon Snow [sequel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel "Sequel") series with [Kit Harington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Harington "Kit Harington") to reprise his role was in early development at HBO.[^101] The [working title](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title "Working title") is *Snow* and Martin confirmed his involvement with the project and that Harington initiated the idea.[^patten-102] Also in June, Martin said there were still three other [live-action](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action "Live action") series in development: *10,000 Ships* (written by Amanda Segal), *9 Voyages* aka *Sea Snake* (written by [Bruno Heller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Heller "Bruno Heller")), and the [Dunk & Egg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Dunk_and_Egg "Tales of Dunk and Egg") [prequel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel "Prequel") series (written by [Steven Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Conrad "Steven Conrad")), tentatively titled either *The Hedge Knight* or *Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.*[^patten-102]

In January 2021, an animated drama series was announced as in development at [HBO Max](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Max "HBO Max").[^103] In July 2021, two more animated series were in development at HBO Max, with one being set in Yi Ti, a nation in [Essos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essos "Essos") loosely based on [Imperial China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_China "Imperial China").[^104]

Martin's work has been described as having "complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing" by literary critic [Jeff VanderMeer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_VanderMeer "Jeff VanderMeer").[^105] [Dana Jennings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Jennings "Dana Jennings") of the *New York Times* described Martin's work as "fantasy for grown ups"[^106] and [Lev Grossman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Grossman "Lev Grossman") wrote that it was dark and cynical.[^107] Martin's first novel, *[Dying of the Light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_of_the_Light_\(Martin_novel\) "Dying of the Light (Martin novel)")*, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of [melancholy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_\(mood\) "Depression (mood)"). His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to [idealisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism") in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of [tragic heroes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_hero "Tragic hero") or [antiheroes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero "Antihero") in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: "Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic."[^tmwagner-108]

 Martin in November 2016

The overall gloominess of *A Song of Ice and Fire* can be an obstacle for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, "If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere."[^109] However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of "realness" and "completeness" – including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) [consequential plot twists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripeteia "Peripeteia") that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:

> There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.[^tmwagner-108]

Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. *Publishers Weekly* writes of his ongoing epic fantasy *A Song of Ice and Fire*: "The complexity of characters such as [Daenerys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen "Daenerys Targaryen"), [Arya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya_Stark "Arya Stark") and [the Kingslayer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Lannister "Jaime Lannister") will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like [Tolkien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien") or [Jordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan "Robert Jordan"), makes us care about their fates."[^110] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".[^111]

In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic "[good versus evil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil "Good and evil")" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent "heroic knights and chivalry" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien")'s *[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings "The Lord of the Rings")*. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as "Disneyland Middle Ages",[^112] which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as "the American Tolkien" by literary critics.[^113] While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien's legacy,[^114] he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien's "medieval philosophy" of "if the king was a good man, the land would prosper" to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: "We look at real history and it's not that simple... Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king."[^115] Per this fact Martin has been credited with the rise of [grimdark fantasy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimdark_fantasy "Grimdark fantasy"), a modern form of an "anti-Tolkien" approach to fantasy writing which,[^116] according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist [Adam Roberts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Roberts_\(British_writer\) "Adam Roberts (British writer)"), is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien's idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien's work.[^roberts_2014-117][^118] The Canadian fantasy writer [R. Scott Bakker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Scott_Bakker "R. Scott Bakker") "says he wouldn't have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first".[^119] Similarly, [Mark Lawrence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lawrence_\(author\) "Mark Lawrence (author)"), author of *[Prince of Thorns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broken_Empire_Trilogy "The Broken Empire Trilogy")*, was inspired by Martin and impressed by his Red Wedding scene.[^120]

The author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of [historical fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction "Historical fiction"), which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the [European medieval era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe "Medieval Europe") that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical [class system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_system "Class system") of [feudal societies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism")[^121] that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as *A Song of Ice and Fire* is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward,[^122] not a generic [deus ex machina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina "Deus ex machina") that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; "If you look at *The Lord of the Rings*, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series."[^123] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the [internal conflicts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict "Internal conflict") that define the [human condition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition "Human condition"), which, in deriving inspiration from [William Faulkner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner "William Faulkner"),[^124] he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.[^125]

In 2018, Martin called *[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings "The Lord of the Rings")*, *[The Great Gatsby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby "The Great Gatsby")*, *[Gone with the Wind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_\(novel\) "Gone with the Wind (novel)")*, *[Great Expectations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations "Great Expectations")*, *[Lonesome Dove](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonesome_Dove "Lonesome Dove")*, *[Catch-22](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22 "Catch-22")*, and *[Charlotte's Web](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web "Charlotte's Web")* "favorites all, towering masterpieces, books that changed my life".[^126]
