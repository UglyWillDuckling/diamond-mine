## Vite ⚡

> Next Generation Frontend Tooling

- 💡 Instant Server Start
- ⚡️ Lightning Fast [[HMR]]
- 🛠️ Rich Features
- 📦 Optimized Build
- 🔩 Universal Plugin Interface
- 🔑 **Fully Typed** APIs

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced [`/vit/`](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vitejs/vite@main/docs/public/vite.mp3), like "veet") is a new breed of frontend build tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).
- A [build command](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.
