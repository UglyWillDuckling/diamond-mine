The selection of Berlin as the host city for the 1936 Olympics was a decision made prior to the rise of Nazi power, yet it was one that carried significant implications as the political landscape evolved. Chosen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1931, Berlin was selected amidst a backdrop of growing geopolitical tensions and concerns over the rise of nationalist ideologies in Europe.

The decision to award the Games to Berlin was influenced by various factors, including Germany’s strong sporting tradition, its infrastructure capabilities, and a desire to promote international cooperation through sports. However, the selection of Berlin as the host city ultimately became enmeshed in controversy as Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party ascended to power, transforming the Games into a platform for promoting their propaganda and ideology.

Despite being chosen before the Nazis came to power, Berlin’s selection set the stage for a highly charged and politically charged Olympic Games, where the ideals of athleticism and camaraderie clashed with the realities of a world on the brink of war.

Despite international outrage, including in the United States, over 49 countries participated. Nazi pledges to adhere to Olympic principles were not fully honored, highlighting the complexities of sports and politics during that era.

Designed by architect Werner March, the stadium embodied the monumental aspirations of the Nazi regime, serving as the centerpiece of the Games and a symbol of German engineering excellence. Its sleek lines, monumental colonnades, and sweeping curves reflected the prevailing architectural style of the time, blending classical elements with modernist sensibilities.

With a capacity of over 100,000 spectators, the stadium provided an awe-inspiring backdrop for the athletic competitions and ceremonies that unfolded within its hallowed grounds. Beyond its functional purpose, the stadium symbolized the ambition and propaganda of the Nazi regime, intended to showcase the supposed strength and superiority of the Aryan race.

Despite its association with a dark chapter in history, the Berlin Olympic Stadium remains a testament to the enduring legacy of Olympic architecture, inspiring future generations of architects and athletes alike with its timeless design and monumental presence.

The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay stands as a testament to the Nazi regime’s skillful manipulation of symbolism and propaganda to further their political agenda. Introducing the concept of carrying the Olympic Flame from Greece to the host city via a relay system for the first time, this innovation was not merely a ceremonial tradition but a carefully crafted tool to link the Nazi movement with ancient ideals of unity and strength.

In Hitler’s own rhetoric, the relay symbolized a sportive and knightly battle that united competitors in understanding and respect. However, behind the facade of unity lay the insidious intent to propagate Nazi ideology and present the regime as the torchbearers of a new world order, where strength and unity were paramount.

Hitler’s sentiment, while seemingly benign, encapsulates the regime’s manipulation of Olympic symbolism for their own political gain, tarnishing the purity of the Olympic Flame with the stains of propaganda and tyranny.

On August 1, 1936, the grandeur of the Berlin Olympic Stadium set the stage for the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics. The atmosphere was electrified as the iconic German airship Hindenburg soared overhead, carrying the Olympic flag.

Amidst the anticipation, Adolf Hitler and his entourage made their entrance, heralding the commencement of the parade of nations. Each country, adorned in its distinctive attire, marched proudly into the stadium, with Greece leading the procession as the birthplace of the Olympics, and Germany, the host nation, bringing up the rear.

As the delegations passed Hitler, diverse gestures ensued, from purposeful Nazi salutes to the solemn hats-over-hearts gesture displayed by the United States, India, and China. Notably, some nations, including the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, chose not to lower their flags as they passed the Führer, citing various reasons.

Amidst the spectacle, Hitler officially declared the games open, his presence towering from a prominent box above the crowd, symbolizing his desire for glorification. The ceremony culminated in the inaugural torch relay.

The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin served as a facade of inclusivity while concealing the deep-seated anti-Semitic sentiments of the Nazi regime. Despite outward portrayals of tolerance and equality, Adolf Hitler’s government implemented stringent anti-Semitic policies leading up to and during the Games, seeking to present a sanitized image to the world.

While Jewish athletes were technically allowed to participate, they faced discrimination, intimidation, and exclusion from German sports clubs and competitions in the years leading up to the Olympics. Moreover, despite international pressure, the Nazis refused to lift discriminatory measures against Jewish athletes for the duration of the Games.

Notably, the [German-Jewish fencer Helene Mayer](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/helene-mayer), allowed to compete under a special agreement, faced pressure to publicly disassociate herself from her Jewish heritage. The Games, presented as a symbol of international cooperation and sportsmanship, were marred by the shadow of anti-Semitism, serving as a testament to the duplicitous nature of Nazi propaganda and the systemic discrimination faced by Jewish athletes within Germany and abroad.

Helene Mayer, born in Germany in 1910, emerged as a dominant force in the world of fencing, securing multiple national championships and achieving Olympic gold at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. Despite encountering discrimination due to her Jewish background, Mayer’s dedication to her sport remained unwavering.

In a historic moment, she represented Germany once again at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, capturing a silver medal in fencing. While her decision to compete for Germany amidst the backdrop of Nazi ideology sparked controversy, Mayer’s legacy as an Olympic champion and trailblazer in fencing endures as a testament to her skill, determination, and resilience in the face of adversity. Following the Olympics, Mayer relocated to the United States, where she became a naturalized citizen in 1940.

Jesse Owens’ triumph at the 1936 Olympics stands as an enduring testament to the power of athleticism to transcend the barriers of racism and discrimination. As an African American track and field athlete competing in a racially charged atmosphere, Owens faced not only the physical challenges of athletic competition but also the pervasive racial prejudices of the time.

Against this backdrop, Owens’ remarkable performances on the track became a beacon of hope and inspiration, captivating the hearts and minds of millions worldwide.

Owens’ historic feat of winning four gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and 4×100 meters relay was more than just a display of athletic excellence; it was a profound statement against the racist ideologies espoused by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.

In the face of Hitler’s Aryan narrative, which sought to promote the supposed superiority of the white race, Owens’ victories shattered stereotypes and challenged the notion of racial hierarchy. His remarkable achievements on the Olympic stage served as a powerful rebuttal to the racial prejudices of the time, demonstrating that talent, determination, and hard work were the true markers of athletic success, regardless of race or ethnicity.

German long jumper Luz Long and [African American sprinter Jesse Owens](https://jesseowens.com/) formed an unexpected bond of friendship that transcended barriers. Long’s support for Owens extended beyond mere competition; he offered advice and encouragement during the qualifying rounds, helping Owens improve his performance.

Despite the intense rivalry between them, Long’s genuine empathy and sportsmanship shone through.

After Owens’ stunning victory in the long jump event, Long congratulated him with a heartfelt embrace, disregarding the racial animosity propagated by the Nazi regime. Their embrace, witnessed by Hitler and other Nazi officials, sparked controversy and earned Long reprimand from Rudolf Hess, Hitler’s deputy, who ordered him never to embrace a “Negro” again.

Long’s courageous act of friendship and solidarity with Owens exemplified the true spirit of sportsmanship, defying the racial prejudices of the time and leaving a lasting impact on both men.

[Adolf “Adi” Dassler and Rudolf “Rudi” Dassler, brothers and co-founders of the renowned sportswear brands Adidas and Puma](https://www.tbsnews.net/features/adidas-and-puma-how-sibling-rivalry-gave-rise-two-giants-sports-world-710938), respectively, played significant but contrasting roles in the story of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.  
Adi Dassler, the elder brother and founder of Adidas, had a fortuitous encounter with Jesse Owens during the Games.

Recognizing Owens’ exceptional athletic talent, Adi provided him with a pair of track spikes, purportedly the first-ever spiked shoes designed for running. Owens went on to achieve historic victories wearing these shoes. Adi’s act of support for Owens, regardless of his race, showcased his commitment to athletic excellence and innovation, transcending political and social barriers.

Amidst the political tensions of the 1936 Olympics, another remarkable story emerged – that of the American rowing team, famously known as the “Boys in the Boat.”

Comprised of working-class young men from the University of Washington, this crew faced immense odds as they competed against elite rowing programs from around the world. Led by their determined coach, Al Ulbrickson, and coxswain Bobby Moch, the team defied expectations and overcame adversity to secure victory in the rowing competitions.

Their journey to Olympic gold was chronicled in Daniel James Brown’s bestselling book, “The Boys in the Boat,” which detailed the team’s arduous training, their bond of brotherhood, and the hardships they endured both on and off the water.

Against the backdrop of Nazi propaganda and political turmoil, the Boys in the Boat represented the triumph of the human spirit over adversity, embodying the ideals of perseverance, teamwork, and resilience. They were recently portrayed in a movie directed by George Clooney.

Joseph Goebbels, the mastermind behind Nazi propaganda, played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative surrounding the 1936 Berlin Olympics. As Minister of Propaganda and head of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Goebbels orchestrated a meticulously crafted image of the Games to promote Nazi ideology and showcase Germany as a powerful and progressive nation under Adolf Hitler’s rule.

Leveraging various media channels, including newspapers, radio broadcasts, and films, Goebbels and his propaganda machine sought to portray the Olympics as a symbol of Aryan superiority and international acclaim.

Under Goebbels’ direction, the Berlin Olympics became a platform for disseminating Nazi propaganda both domestically and abroad. The meticulously choreographed opening ceremony, with its grandiose displays and carefully curated symbolism, served as a spectacle of Nazi power and dominance.

Additionally, Goebbels capitalized on the international attention surrounding the Games to promote the image of Germany as a peaceful and welcoming host, despite the regime’s human rights abuses and discriminatory policies.

One of the most significant propaganda efforts orchestrated by Goebbels was the production of [Leni Riefenstahl’s documentary film “Olympia](https://www.docsonline.tv/olympia/).” It stands as a monumental yet controversial piece of cinematic history that captured the essence of the 1936 Olympics.

Tasked with immortalizing Hitler’s vision of the Games and perpetuating the myth of Aryan supremacy, Riefenstahl meticulously crafted a cinematic masterpiece that transcended mere documentation. Through her innovative use of cinematic techniques and carefully selected footage, she portrayed the Games as a triumph of Nazi propaganda, glorifying Hitler’s regime and perpetuating its narrative for years to come.

Despite the film’s undeniable technical innovation and artistic merit, it remains deeply entrenched in controversy due to its propagandistic elements and its role in promoting Nazi ideology. Riefenstahl’s skillful manipulation of imagery and narrative has been scrutinized for its blatant glorification of Hitler and the Nazi regime, as well as its perpetuation of the myth of Aryan superiority.

While some commend Riefenstahl’s artistic prowess and argue for the separation of art from politics, others condemn her complicity in propagating a destructive and genocidal ideology.

The 1936 Olympics marked the first direct radio broadcast of the Games, with 41 licensed broadcasting companies, 68 locations, and 3000 broadcasts in 40 countries.

Television debuted with a Farnsworth camera transmitting 15 broadcasts totaling 19 hours from the Olympic Stadium. The Reichspost installed an Iconoscope camera in the swimming stadium, capturing swimmers underwater for the first time. Despite limited private television ownership, Berlin had 25 TV parlors, Leipzig had two, and Potsdam had one, attracting 162,228 paying visitors.

Approximately 1800 accredited journalists covered the Games, and the Reichssportverlag published 30 issues of the “Olympia Zeitung.” The organizing committee released a two-part official report in German and English, spanning over 1200 pages.

Moreover, the Games were not only broadcast in black-and-white but also witnessed another technological breakthrough with the introduction of color photography and filming using the newly invented Agfacolor.

This groundbreaking broadcasting effort not only brought the excitement of the Olympics into homes across Germany but also paved the way for the future of sports broadcasting, setting a precedent for the extensive coverage and innovation that would define modern Olympic telecasts.

After the 1936 Olympics, Hitler announced in September 1937 that Germany would no longer participate in any future Games. He declared that henceforth, Nuremberg would host the world’s greatest sports events and the largest sports competitions ever held, all organized by Germany.

Behind Hitler’s statement lay more than mere fantasy. By late November 1936, a decree was signed, stipulating that under the auspices of the SA, so-called National Socialist Combat Games would be held in the future.

These games were intended as a kind of national Olympics, serving as a continuation or replacement of the Olympic Games. Albert Speer informed Hitler in 1937 that the existing plans for the German Stadium did not comply with Olympic standards.

Hitler responded that this was inconsequential, as after 1940, he believed the Olympics would be held permanently in Germany, specifically in that stadium, and the dimensions of the sports field would be determined by Germany.

The Berlin Olympic Stadium and Olympic Village have evolved into vibrant hubs of activity and cultural significance in the modern era. The stadium continues to serve as a multifunctional venue for a variety of sporting events, concerts, and cultural gatherings.

Renovated and modernized over the years, it stands as a symbol of resilience and renewal, hosting international soccer matches, track and field competitions, and even major concerts featuring renowned artists. Just last year the Special Olympics took place here, celebrating people with intellectual disabilities who would have been persecuted during the Nazi era.
