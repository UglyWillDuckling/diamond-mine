In this video, I distill my overall productivity philosophy into ten tips for Obsidian usage.  
  
Before you watch this video, ask yourself: ARE YOU PROCRASTINATION BY WATCHING THIS VIDEO? If so, go do your work! Come back to this video later. :)  
  
This video is a slight departure from my other videos. Usually, my content is very hands-on and in-the-weeds, because that's how my brain works. I don't watch videos just to hear a bunch of wordsâ€”just show me \*how\* to do something and tell me \*why\* I'm doing it that way.  
  
However, this video is less \*how\* and more \*why\*, so it's the opposite of how my content usually is. But hopefully you find it useful and interesting anyway. I sure wish I had this knowledge when I was first getting started with Obsidian.
