I’ve been really stuck on installing rockbox on my iPod 6th gen. Whenever I go into DFU mode, the connection to the iPod is lost and the installer won’t continue. I’ve tried this on a Linux pc, a Mac, even even asked a co-worker with a windows PC. All without luck.

`********************************************`  
`*************** Logger *******************`  
`*********************************************`  
`Downloading bootloader file...`  
`Download finished.`  
`Ejecting iPod...`  
`Action required:`  
`Please make sure no programs are accessing files on the device. If ejecting still fails please use your computers eject functionality.`

`Device successfully ejected.`  
`Waiting for HDD spin-down...`  
`Waiting for DFU mode...`

`Action required:`  
`Press and hold SELECT+MENU buttons, after about 12 seconds a new action will require you to release the buttons, DO IT QUICKLY, otherwise the process could fail.`

`DFU mode detected.`

`Action required:`  
`Release SELECT+MENU buttons and wait...`  
`Transfering DFU image...`  
`[ERR] DFU device not found`  
`Could not transfer DFU image.`

I've also created a [video](https://youtu.be/IxbaUaLyVJI?feature=shared) of the whole process, In case it might help.  
I've also asked on [r/ipod](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/) without avail.

Do you have any tips on alternative routes to get Rocksbox installed? I'm fed up with iTunes and the inability to play FLAC on my iPod.
