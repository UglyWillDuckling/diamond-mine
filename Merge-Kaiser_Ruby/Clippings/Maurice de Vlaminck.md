**Maurice de Vlaminck** (French: [\[vlamɛ̃k\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French "Help:IPA/French"); 4 April 1876 - 11 October 1958) was a French painter. Along with [André Derain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Derain "André Derain") and [Henri Matisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse "Henri Matisse"), he is considered one of the principal figures in the [Fauve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism "Fauvism") movement, a group of [modern artists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art "Modern art") who from 1904 to 1908 were united in their use of intense colour.[^freeman13-1] Vlaminck was one of the Fauves at the controversial [Salon d'Automne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_d%27Automne "Salon d'Automne") exhibition of 1905.

Maurice de Vlaminck was born on [Rue Pierre Lescot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Halles "Les Halles") in Paris. His father Edmond Julien was [Flemish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_people "Flemish people") and taught violin and his mother Joséphine Caroline Grillet came from [Lorraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine "Lorraine") and taught piano.[^lesfauves-2] His father taught him to play the violin.[^melikian-3] He began painting in his late teens. In 1893, he studied with a painter named Henri Rigalon on the [Île de Chatou](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele_des_Impressionnistes "fr:Île des Impressionnistes").[^4] In 1894 he married Suzanne Berly. The turning point in his life was a chance meeting on the train to Paris towards the end of his stint in the army. Vlaminck, then 23 and already active in anarchist circles in Paris,[^5] met an aspiring artist, [André Derain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Derain "André Derain"), with whom he struck up a lifelong friendship.[^melikian-3] When Vlaminck completed his army service in 1900, the two rented a studio together, the Maison Levanneur, which now houses the Cneai,[^6] for a year before Derain left to do his own military service.[^melikian-3] In 1902 and 1903 he wrote several mildly pornographic novels illustrated by Derain.[^freeman319-7] He painted during the day and earned his livelihood by giving violin lessons and performing with musical bands at night.[^melikian-3]

Vlaminck participated in the controversial 1905 [Salon d'Automne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_d%27Automne "Salon d'Automne") exhibition. After viewing the boldly colored canvases of Vlaminck, [Henri Matisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse "Henri Matisse"), [André Derain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Derain "André Derain"), [Albert Marquet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Marquet "Albert Marquet"), [Kees van Dongen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kees_van_Dongen "Kees van Dongen"), [Charles Camoin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Camoin "Charles Camoin"), and [Jean Puy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Puy "Jean Puy"), the art critic [Louis Vauxcelles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vauxcelles "Louis Vauxcelles") disparaged the painters as "*fauves*" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, [Fauvism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism "Fauvism").[^gil_blas,_17_october_1905-8]

In 1911, Vlaminck traveled to London and painted by the [Thames](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames "Thames"). In 1913, he painted again with Derain in [Marseille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille "Marseille") and [Martigues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martigues "Martigues"). In World War I he was stationed in Paris, and began writing poetry. Eventually he settled in Rueil-la-Gadelière, a small village south-west of Paris. He married his second wife, Berthe Combes, with whom he had two daughters. From 1925 he traveled throughout France, but continued to paint primarily along the [Seine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine "Seine"), near Paris. Resentful that [Fauvism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism "Fauvism") had been overtaken by [Cubism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism "Cubism") as an [art movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement "Art movement") Vlaminck blamed [Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso "Picasso") "for dragging French painting into a wretched dead end and state of confusion". During the Second World War, Vlaminck visited Germany and on his return published a tirade against Picasso and Cubism in the periodical *Comoedia* in June 1942. Vlaminck wrote many autobiographies.[^9]

Vlaminck died in Rueil-la-Gadelière on 11 October 1958.

Two of Vlaminck's groundbreaking paintings, *Sur le zinc* (At the Bar) and *L'homme a la pipe* (Man Smoking a Pipe) were painted in 1900.[^melikian-3]

For the next few years Vlaminck lived in or near Chatou (the inspiration for his painting *houses at Chatou*), painting and exhibiting alongside Derain, Matisse, and other Fauvist painters. At this time his exuberant paint application and vibrant use of colour displayed the influence of [Vincent van Gogh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh "Vincent van Gogh"). *Sur le zinc* called to mind the work of [Toulouse-Lautrec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse-Lautrec "Toulouse-Lautrec") and his portrayals of prostitutes and solitary drinkers, but does not attempt to probe the sitter's psychology—a break with the century-old European tradition of individualized portraiture.[^melikian-3] According to art critic [Souren Melikian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souren_Melikian "Souren Melikian"), it is "the impersonal cartoon of a type."[^melikian-3] In his landscape paintings, his approach was similar. He ignored the details, with the landscape becoming a vehicle through which he could express mood through violent colour and brushwork.[^melikian-3] An example is *Sous bois*, painted in 1904. The following year, he began to experiment with "deconstruction," turning the physical world into dabs and streaks of colour that convey a sense of motion.[^melikian-3] His paintings *Le Pont de Chatou* (The Chatou Bridge), *Les Ramasseurs de pommes de terre* (The Potato Pickers), *La Seine a Chatou* (The River Seine at Chatou) and *Le Verger* (The Orchard) exemplify this trend.[^melikian-3]
