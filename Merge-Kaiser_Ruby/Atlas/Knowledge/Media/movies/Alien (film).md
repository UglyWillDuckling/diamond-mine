*Alien* premiered on May 25, 1979, the opening night of the fourth [Seattle International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_International_Film_Festival "Seattle International Film Festival").[^8][^9][^10] It received a [wide release](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_release "Wide release") on June 22 and was released on September 6 in the United Kingdom. It initially received mixed reviews, but won the [Academy Award for Best Visual Effects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects"), three [Saturn Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award "Saturn Award") ([Best Science Fiction Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Science_Fiction_Film "Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film"), [Best Direction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Direction "Saturn Award for Best Direction") for Scott, and [Best Supporting Actress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress "Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress") for Cartwright), and a [Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation "Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation"). *Alien* grossed $78.9 million in the United States and £7.8 million in the United Kingdom during its first theatrical run. Its worldwide gross to date has been estimated at between $104 million and $203 million.

In subsequent years, *Alien* was critically reassessed and is now considered [one of the greatest and most influential science fiction and horror films of all time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best "List of films considered the best"). In 2002, *Alien* was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [Library of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") and was selected for preservation in the United States [National Film Registry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry "National Film Registry"). In 2008, it was ranked by the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by *[Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(film_magazine\) "Empire (film magazine)")*. The success of *Alien* spawned [a media franchise of films, books, video games, and toys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(franchise\) "Alien (franchise)"), and propelled Weaver's acting career. The story of [her character](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Ripley "Ellen Ripley")'s encounters with the alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels *[Aliens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_\(film\) "Aliens (film)")* (1986), *[Alien 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_3 "Alien 3")* (1992), and *[Alien Resurrection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Resurrection "Alien Resurrection")* (1997). A crossover with the *[Predator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_\(franchise\) "Predator (franchise)")* franchise produced the *[Alien vs. Predator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator "Alien vs. Predator")* films, while a [two-film prequel series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(franchise\)#Prequel_series "Alien (franchise)") was directed by Scott before *[Alien: Romulus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Romulus "Alien: Romulus")* (2024), a standalone sequel, was released.
## plot

The commercial space tug *[[Nostromo]]* is returning to Earth with a seven-member crew in "stasis" ([suspended animation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_animation_in_fiction "Suspended animation in fiction")): captain Dallas, executive officer Kane, warrant officer [Ripley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Ripley "Ellen Ripley"), navigator Lambert, science officer [Ash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_\(Alien\) "Ash (Alien)"), and engineers Parker and Brett. The ship's computer, Mother, detects a transmission from a nearby planet and awakens the crew. Following company policy to investigate transmissions indicating intelligent life, they land on the planet and Dallas, Kane, and Lambert head out to investigate. They discover that the transmission comes from a derelict alien spaceship, where they find the remains of a large alien with a hole in its torso. Later, Mother deciphers part of the transmission, which Ripley determines to be a warning message.

Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large eggs. When he touches one, a spider-like [creature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph#Facehugger "Xenomorph") springs out, penetrates his helmet, and attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the *Nostromo*. As the acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash overrides her. While Parker and Brett work on repairing the *Nostromo*, Ash attempts to remove the creature from Kane's face. He stops when he discovers that its highly corrosive acidic blood could harm Kane and potentially damage the ship's hull. The creature eventually detaches itself and dies. After the crew returns to space, Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise seems well. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he suddenly chokes and convulses. A [small alien creature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph#Chestburster "Xenomorph") bursts from his chest, killing him, and escapes into the ship.

After ejecting Kane's body out of an airlock, the crew attempts to locate the creature using tracking devices and kill it. Brett follows the crew's pet cat, [Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_\(fictional_cat\) "Jones (fictional cat)"), into a landing leg compartment,[^ridley_scott_interview2-11] where the now fully grown alien kills Brett. The crew determines that the alien must be in the air ducts. Dallas enters the ducts with a flamethrower, intending to force the creature into an airlock, but it attacks and kills him. Parker later finds only the flamethrower. Lambert suggests fleeing in the escape shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that it will not support four people and insists on continuing Dallas's plan to flush out the alien.

While accessing Mother, Ripley discovers that the crew was awoken and directed to the planet because the company secretly ordered Ash to return with the alien for study, and to consider the crew expendable. She confronts Ash, who tries to kill her. Parker intervenes, knocking Ash's head loose and revealing him to be an [android](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_\(robot\) "Android (robot)"). The survivors reactivate Ash's head, and he confirms the company's orders. Ash states that the alien is unkillable and expresses his admiration for it, taunting them about their chances of survival. Ripley shuts him down and Parker incinerates him.

The crew decides to self-destruct the *Nostromo* and escape in the shuttle. While gathering supplies, Parker and Lambert are killed by the alien. Now alone, Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence, but the alien blocks her path to the shuttle. She retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct. She reaches the shuttle unhindered with Jones, narrowly escaping as the *Nostromo* explodes.

As Ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers the alien has stowed itself in a narrow compartment. She dons a spacesuit and flushes it out. It approaches Ripley, but before it can kill her, she opens the airlock door. The resulting explosive decompression almost ejects the alien into space, but it hangs onto the door frame. Ripley fires a grappling hook gun to push it out and activates the engines, blasting the alien into space. After recording her final log entry, she places Jones and herself into stasis for the trip back to Earth.

The principal cast members of *Alien* (left to right: [Holm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Holm "Ian Holm"), [Stanton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton "Harry Dean Stanton"), [Weaver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver "Sigourney Weaver"), [Kotto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaphet_Kotto "Yaphet Kotto"), [Skerritt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Skerritt "Tom Skerritt"), [Cartwright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Cartwright "Veronica Cartwright"), and [Hurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hurt "John Hurt"))

- [Tom Skerritt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Skerritt "Tom Skerritt") as Dallas, captain of the *Nostromo*. Skerritt had been approached early in the film's development, but declined as it did not yet have a director and had a very low budget. Later, when Scott was attached as director and the budget had been doubled, Skerritt accepted the role.[^mcintee,_29-12][^truckers-13]
- [Sigourney Weaver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver "Sigourney Weaver") as [Ripley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Ripley "Ellen Ripley"), the [warrant officer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_officer "Warrant officer") aboard the *Nostromo*. [Meryl Streep](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep "Meryl Streep") was considered for the role, but she was not contacted as her partner [John Cazale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cazale "John Cazale") had recently died.[^14] [Helen Mirren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Mirren "Helen Mirren") also auditioned.[^15] Weaver, who had Broadway experience but was relatively unknown in film, impressed Scott, Giler, and Hill with her audition. She was the last actor to be cast for the film and performed most of her [screen tests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_test "Screen test") in-studio as the sets were being built.[^truckers-13][^mcintee,_30-16] The role of Ripley was Weaver's first leading role in a motion picture and earned her nominations for a [Saturn Award for Best Actress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Actress "Saturn Award for Best Actress") and a [BAFTA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts "British Academy of Film and Television Arts") award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Role.[^17]
- [Veronica Cartwright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Cartwright "Veronica Cartwright") as Lambert, the *Nostromo*'s [navigator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigator "Navigator"). Cartwright had experience in horror and science-fiction films, having acted as a child in *[The Birds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_\(film\) "The Birds (film)")* (1963), and more recently in *[Invasion of the Body Snatchers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_\(1978_film\) "Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)")* (1978).[^mcintee,_17-18] She originally read for the role of Ripley and was not informed that she had instead been cast as Lambert until she arrived in London for wardrobe.[^truckers-13][^mcintee,_29-30-19] She disliked the character's emotional weakness,[^mcintee,_30-16] but nevertheless accepted the role: "They convinced me that I was the audience's fears; I was a reflection of what the audience is feeling."[^truckers-13] Cartwright won a [Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress "Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress") for her performance.[^past_saturn_awards-20]
- [Harry Dean Stanton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton "Harry Dean Stanton") as Brett, the engineering technician. Stanton's first words to Scott during his audition were, "I don't like sci fi or monster movies".[^mcintee,_29-12] Scott was amused, and convinced Stanton to take the role after reassuring him that *Alien* would actually be a [thriller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film "Thriller film") more akin to *[Ten Little Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_\(1974_film\) "And Then There Were None (1974 film)")*.[^mcintee,_29-12]
- [John Hurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hurt "John Hurt") as Kane, the [executive officer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer "Executive officer") who becomes the host for the alien. Hurt was Scott's first choice for the role, but he was contracted on a film in South Africa during *Alien*'s filming dates, so [Jon Finch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Finch "Jon Finch") was cast as Kane, instead.[^mcintee,_30-16] However, Finch became ill during the first day of shooting and was diagnosed with type 1 [diabetes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus "Diabetes mellitus"), which had also exacerbated a case of [bronchitis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_bronchitis "Acute bronchitis").[^mcintee,_32-21] Hurt was in London by this time, his South African project having fallen through, and he quickly replaced Finch.[^truckers-13][^mcintee,_32-21] His performance earned him a nomination for a [BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Supporting_Role "BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role").[^22]
- [Ian Holm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Holm "Ian Holm") as [Ash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_\(Alien\) "Ash (Alien)"), the ship's science officer who is revealed to be an [android](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_\(robot\) "Android (robot)"). Holm was a [character actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor "Character actor"), who, by 1979, had already been in 20 films.
- [Yaphet Kotto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaphet_Kotto "Yaphet Kotto") as Parker, the chief engineer.[^truckers-13] Kotto was sent a script off the back of his recent success as villain Dr. Kananga in the *[James Bond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_of_the_James_Bond_films "Production of the James Bond films")* film *[Live and Let Die](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_\(film\) "Live and Let Die (film)")* (1973), and said he rejected a lucrative film offer in the hope of being cast in *Alien*.[^24]
- [Bolaji Badejo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolaji_Badejo "Bolaji Badejo") as [the alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph "Xenomorph"). Badejo, as a 26-year-old design student, was discovered in a bar by a member of the casting team, who put him in touch with Scott.[^mcintee,_30-16][^8th_passenger-25] Scott believed that Badejo, at 6 feet 10 inches (208 cm) — 7 feet (210 cm) inside the costume — and with a slender frame,[^26] could portray the alien and look as if his arms and legs were too long to be real, creating the illusion that a human being could not possibly be inside the costume.[^mcintee,_30-16][^8th_passenger-25][^book_of_alien-27] [Stuntmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntmen "Stuntmen") [Eddie Powell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Powell "Eddie Powell") and [Roy Scammell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Scammell "Roy Scammell") also portrayed the alien in some scenes.[^book_of_alien-27][^mcintee,_30-31-28]
- [Helen Horton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Horton "Helen Horton") as the voice of Mother, the *Nostromo*'s computer.[^indie-29]

[![A man covered with sweat lays on a medical examination table, with a spider-like alien creature covering his face. The creature is beige in color and has four long, thin fingers on either side of its body that grasp tightly around the man's head, and its long tail is coiled around his neck.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Alien-The_Facehugger.png/200px-Alien-The_Facehugger.png)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alien-The_Facehugger.png)

The "facehugger" was the first creature Giger designed for the film, giving it human-like fingers and a long tail.[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_31-72]

[![The head and tail of an alien creature is emerging from the ruptured chest cavity of a dead man. The small eyeless creature is beige in color, has sharp metallic-looking teeth and a long segmented tail. A significant amount of blood covers the creature and the man's body.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Alien-The_Chestburster.png/200px-Alien-The_Chestburster.png)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alien-The_Chestburster.png)
The "[[chestburster]]" was shoved up through the table and a false torso by a puppeteer.[^8th_passenger-25] The scene has been recognized as one of the film's most memorable.

[[H. R. Giger]]
O'Bannon introduced Scott to the artwork of [H. R. Giger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger "H. R. Giger"); both of them felt that his painting *[Necronom IV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronom_IV "Necronom IV")* was the type of representation they wanted for the film's antagonist and began asking the studio to hire him as a designer.[^visualists-44][^mcintee,_27-47] Fox initially believed Giger's work was too ghastly for audiences, but the Brandywine team were persistent and eventually won out.[^mcintee,_27-47] According to Gordon Carroll: "The first second that Ridley saw Giger's work, he knew that the biggest single design problem, maybe the biggest problem in the film, had been solved."[^visualists-44] Scott flew to [Zürich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich") to meet Giger and recruited him to work on all aspects of the alien and its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict spacecraft, and all four forms of the alien from the egg to the adult.[^visualists-44][^mcintee,_27-47]

The scene of Kane inspecting the egg was shot in postproduction. A [fiberglass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass "Fiberglass") egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves.[^mcintee,_34-73] The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and [tripe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripe "Tripe").[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_34-73] Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason, the image of a hen's egg was used on the poster and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole—as opposed to the alien egg that appears in the finished film.[^mcintee,_34-73]

The "facehugger" and its [proboscis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis "Proboscis"), which was made of a sheep's [intestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine "Intestine"), were shot out of the egg using high-pressure air hoses. The shot was reversed and slowed down in editing to prolong the effect and reveal more detail.[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_34-73] The facehugger itself was the first creature that H.R. Giger designed for the film, going through several versions in different sizes before deciding on a small creature with human-like fingers and a long tail.[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_31-72] Dan O'Bannon, with help from Ron Cobb, drew his own version based on Giger's design, which became the final version.[^mcintee,_31-72] Cobb came up with the idea that the creature could have a powerful acid for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional means, such as guns or explosives, since the acid would burn through the ship's hull.[^mcintee,_21-32] For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of fish and [shellfish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish "Shellfish") to create its [viscera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus "Viscus").[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_34-73]

The "chestburster" design was inspired by [Francis Bacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_\(painter\) "Francis Bacon (painter)")'s 1944 painting *[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Studies_for_Figures_at_the_Base_of_a_Crucifixion "Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion")*.[^8th_passenger-25] Giger's original design, which was refined, resembled a plucked chicken.[^8th_passenger-25] Screenwriter [Dan O'Bannon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_O%27Bannon "Dan O'Bannon") credits his experiences with [Crohn's disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease "Crohn's disease") for inspiring the chest-bursting scene.[^observer-74]

For the filming of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the creature would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but they had not been told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and [squibs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_hit_squib "Bullet hit squib").[^mcintee,_32-21][^75] The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest, a stream of blood shot directly at Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics.[^mcintee,_32-21][^8th_passenger-25][^book_of_alien-27] According to Tom Skerritt, "What you saw on camera was the real response. She had no idea what the hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up."[^8th_passenger-25] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.[^8th_passenger-25]

The real-life surprise of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made it one of the film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings, the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater so as not to be too close to the screen during the sequence.[^mcintee,_40-63] The scene has frequently been called one of the most memorable moments in cinema history.[^76] In 2007, *[Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(film_magazine\) "Empire (film magazine)")* named it as the greatest [18-rated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_\(British_Board_of_Film_Classification\) "18 (British Board of Film Classification)") moment in film, ranking it above the [decapitation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation "Decapitation") scene in *[The Omen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omen "The Omen")* (1976) and the transformation sequence in *[An American Werewolf in London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_London "An American Werewolf in London")* (1981).[^empire-77] *[IGN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN")* ranked it the 10th-best film moment of all time.[^78]

For the scene in which Ash is revealed to be an android, a puppet was created of his torso and upper body, which was operated from underneath.[^fear_of_the_unknown-54] During a preview screening, this scene caused an usher to faint.[^mcintee,_40-63][^nightmare_fulfilled-79] In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and reactivated; for portions of this scene, an [animatronic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatronic "Animatronic") head was made using a face cast of Holm.[^mcintee,_35-61] However, the latex of the head shrank while curing and the result was not entirely convincing.[^fear_of_the_unknown-54] For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, [fiber optics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_optics "Fiber optics"), and [Foley urinary catheters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_catheter "Foley catheter") were combined to form the android innards.[^fear_of_the_unknown-54][^mcintee,_35-61]

Further information on the creature: [Xenomorph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph "Xenomorph")

Giger made several conceptual paintings of the adult alien before settling on the final version. He sculpted the body using [plasticine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticine "Plasticine"), incorporating pieces such as [vertebrae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebra "Vertebra") from snakes and cooling tubes from a [Rolls-Royce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_\(car\) "Rolls-Royce (car)").[^mcintee,_30-16][^8th_passenger-25] The head was manufactured separately by [Carlo Rambaldi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rambaldi "Carlo Rambaldi"), who had worked on the aliens in *[Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind "Close Encounters of the Third Kind")*.[^mcintee,_37-80] Rambaldi followed Giger's designs closely, making some modifications to incorporate the moving parts that would animate the jaw and inner mouth.[^8th_passenger-25] A system of hinges and cables was used to operate the rigid tongue, which protruded from the mouth and featured a second mouth at its tip with its own set of movable teeth.[^8th_passenger-25] The final head had about 900 moving parts and points of articulation.[^8th_passenger-25] Part of a [human skull](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull "Human skull") was used as the "face", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head.[^mcintee,_30-16] Rambaldi's original alien jaw is now on display in the [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution "Smithsonian Institution").[^mcintee,_35-61] In April 2007, the original alien suit was sold at auction.[^gadgetmadness-81] Copious amounts of [K-Y Jelly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Y_Jelly "K-Y Jelly") were used to simulate [saliva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva "Saliva") and give the alien a slimy appearance.[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_31-72] The alien vocalizations were provided by [Percy Edwards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Edwards "Percy Edwards"), a [voice artist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_artist "Voice artist") who had provided bird sounds for British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s and the whale sounds for *[Orca: Killer Whale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca_\(1977_film\) "Orca (1977 film)")* (1977).[^mcintee,_38-65][^mcintee,_18-82]

In most scenes, the alien was portrayed by Bolaji Badejo. A latex costume was made to fit Badejo's slender 6-foot-10-inch (208 cm) frame by taking a full-body plaster cast.[^8th_passenger-25][^book_of_alien-27] Scott later said that the alien "takes on elements of the host – in this case, a man".[^mcintee,_27-47] Badejo attended [tai chi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi "Tai chi") and [mime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime_artist "Mime artist") classes to create convincing movements.[^mcintee,_30-16][^8th_passenger-25] For some scenes, such as when the alien lowers itself from the ceiling to kill Brett, it was portrayed by stuntmen Eddie Powell and Roy Scammell.[^book_of_alien-27][^mcintee,_30-31-28] Powell, in costume, was suspended on wires and then lowered in an unfurling motion.[^8th_passenger-25][^mcintee,_34-73]

Scott chose not to show the full alien for most of the film, keeping most of its body in shadow to create a sense of terror and heighten suspense. The audience could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like:[^8th_passenger-25] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like."[^book_of_alien-27] Scott said: "I've never liked horror films before, because in the end it's always been a man in a rubber suit. Well, there's one way to deal with that. The most important thing in a film of this type is not what you see, but the effect of what you *think* you saw."[^book_of_alien-27]

The alien has been referred to as "one of the most iconic movie monsters", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted.[^mackinder_review-83] [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") wrote that "*Alien* uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: it evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do... The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth'."[^ebert_2003_review-55]

The sets of the *Nostromo*'s three decks were each created almost entirely in one piece, with each deck occupying a separate stage. The actors had to navigate through the hallways that connected the stages, adding to the sense of [claustrophobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claustrophobia "Claustrophobia") and realism.[^book_of_alien-27][^fear_of_the_unknown-54][^mcintee,_31-72] The sets used large [transistors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor") and low-resolution computer screens to give the ship a "used", industrial look and make it appear as though it was constructed of "retrofitted old technology".[^darkest_reaches-60] Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs for various areas and aspects.[^darkest_reaches-60] The company that owns the *Nostromo* is not named in the film, and is referred to by the characters as "the company". However, the name and logo of the company appears on several set pieces and props such as computer monitors and beer cans as "Weylan-Yutani".[^mcintee,_15-84] Cobb created the name to imply a business alliance between Britain and Japan, deriving "Weylan" from the [British Leyland Motor Corporation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Leyland_Motor_Corporation "British Leyland Motor Corporation") and "Yutani" from the name of his Japanese neighbor.[^mcintee,_28-85][^86] The 1986 sequel, *[Aliens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_\(film\) "Aliens (film)"),* named the company "Weyland-Yutani",[^mcintee,_28-85][^aliens-87] and it has remained a central aspect of the franchise.

Art director [Roger Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Christian_\(filmmaker\) "Roger Christian (filmmaker)") used scrap metal and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a technique he employed while working on *Star Wars*.[^darkest_reaches-60][^mcintee,_31-32-88] For example, some of the *Nostromo*'s corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to create the illusion of longer corridors in the below-deck area.[^darkest_reaches-60] Special-effects supervisors [Brian Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson_\(special_effects_artist\) "Brian Johnson (special effects artist)") and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers and flamethrowers.[^mcintee,_32-21][^book_of_alien-27]

Giger designed and worked on all the alien aspects, which he designed to appear organic and [biomechanical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanical_art "Biomechanical art") in contrast to the industrial look of the *Nostromo* and its human elements.[^book_of_alien-27][^darkest_reaches-60] For the interior of the derelict spacecraft and egg chamber, he used dried bones with [plaster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster "Plaster") to sculpt the scenery and elements.[^book_of_alien-27][^darkest_reaches-60] Veronica Cartwright described Giger's sets as "so erotic...it's big vaginas and penises...the whole thing is like you're going inside of some sort of womb or whatever...it's sort of visceral."[^darkest_reaches-60] The set with the deceased alien creature, which the production team nicknamed the "space jockey", proved problematic, as 20th Century-Fox did not want to spend the money for such an expensive set that would only be used for one scene. Scott described the set as the [cockpit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team convinced the studio that the scene was important to impress the audience and make them aware that this was not a [B movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie "B movie").[^darkest_reaches-60][^mcintee,_34-73] To save money, only one wall of the set was created, and the "space jockey" sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from different angles in relation to the actors.[^book_of_alien-27][^mcintee,_34-73] Giger [airbrushed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbrush "Airbrush") the entire set and the "space jockey" by hand.[^darkest_reaches-60][^mcintee,_34-73]

The origin of the jockey creature is not explored, but Scott later theorized that it might have been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure, which would be found later by the *Nostromo* crew and would contain statues and [hieroglyphs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph "Hieroglyph") depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space-jockey cultures.[^mcintee,_21-32] Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to shorten the film.[^book_of_alien-27] Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair was removed and the set was redressed to create the egg chamber.[^book_of_alien-27] Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band [the Who](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who "The Who"). The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound stage next door.[^89]

### Spaceships and planets

> I resent films that are so shallow they rely entirely on their visual effects, and of course science-fiction films are notorious for this. I've always felt that there's another way to do it: a lot of effort should be expended toward rendering the environment of the spaceship, or space travel, whatever the fantastic setting of your story should be–as convincingly as possible, but always in the background. That way the story and the characters emerge and *they* become more real.

—Ron Cobb on his designs for *Alien*[^book_of_alien-27]

O'Bannon brought in artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss, with whom he had worked on *[Dark Star](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Star_\(film\) "Dark Star (film)")* and *[Dune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(1984_film\)#Early_attempts_and_Jodorowsky's_Dune "Dune (1984 film)")* respectively, to work on designs for the human aspects such as the spaceship and space suits.[^visualists-44][^mcintee,_28-85] Cobb created hundreds of preliminary sketches of the interiors and exteriors of the ship, which went through many design concepts and possible names such as *Leviathan* and *Snark* as the script developed. The final name was derived from the title of [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad")'s 1904 novel *[Nostromo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostromo "Nostromo")*, while the escape shuttle, called *Narcissus* in the script, was named after Conrad's 1897 [novella](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novella "Novella") *[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nigger_of_the_%27Narcissus%27 "The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'")*.[^mcintee,_15-84] The production team particularly praised Cobb's ability to depict the interior settings of the ship in a realistic and believable manner. Under Scott's direction, the design of the *Nostromo* shifted towards an 800-foot-long (240 m) tug towing a refining platform 2 miles (3.2 km) long and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide.[^book_of_alien-27] Cobb also created some conceptual drawings of the alien, which went unused.[^visualists-44][^mcintee,_28-85] Moebius was attached to the project for a few days and his costume renderings were the basis for the final space suits created by costume designer John Mollo.[^book_of_alien-27][^mcintee,_28-85]

The spaceships and planets were shot using models and miniatures. These included models of the *Nostromo*, its attached mineral refinery, the escape shuttle *Narcissus*, the alien planetoid, and the exterior and interior of the derelict spacecraft. Visual-effects supervisor Brian Johnson and supervising modelmaker [Martin Bower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bower "Martin Bower") and their team worked at Bray Studios, roughly 25 miles (40 km) from Shepperton Studios.[^outward_bound-90][^mcintee,_36-91] The designs of the *Nostromo* and its attachments were based on combinations of Scott's storyboards and Ron Cobb's conceptual drawings.[^outward_bound-90] The basic outlines of the models were made of wood and plastic, and most of the fine details were added from [model kits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model "Scale model") of warships, tanks, and World War II bombers.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Three models of the *Nostromo* were made: a 12-inch (30 cm) version for medium and long shots, a 4-foot (1.2 m) version for rear shots, and a 12-foot (3.7 m), 7-short-ton (6.4 t) rig for the undocking and planetoid surface sequences.[^book_of_alien-27][^mcintee,_36-91] Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams. The *Nostromo* was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on *[The Empire Strikes Back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back "The Empire Strikes Back")*. Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch.[^outward_bound-90][^mcintee,_36-91] He asked that more and more pieces be added to the model such that the final version (with the refinery) required a metal framework so that it could be hoisted by a forklift. He also took a hammer and chisel to sections of the refinery, knocking off many of the spires that Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also had disagreements with miniature-effects cinematographer [Dennis Ayling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ayling "Dennis Ayling") over how to light the models.[^outward_bound-90]

A separate model, about 40 feet (12 m) long, was created for the *Nostromo*'s underside from which the *Narcissus* would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial [shroud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud "Shroud") out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small [catapult](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult "Catapult") and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing.[^outward_bound-90][^mcintee,_37-80] Only one shot was filmed using [blue-screen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key "Chroma key") compositing – that of the shuttle racing past the *Nostromo*. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added by [double exposure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_exposure "Multiple exposure").[^mcintee,_36-91] Though [motion control photography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_control_photography "Motion control photography") technology was available at the time, the budget would not allow for it. Instead, the team used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2+1⁄2 frames per second,[^book_of_alien-27] giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion.[^outward_bound-90] For the scene in which the *Nostromo* detaches from the refinery, a 30-foot (9.1 m) docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The *Nostromo* was pushed away from the refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward.[^outward_bound-90][^mcintee,_36-91] Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models, which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.[^outward_bound-90]

A separate model was created for the exterior of the derelict alien spacecraft. [Matte paintings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_\(filmmaking\) "Matte (filmmaking)") were used to fill in areas of the ship's interior, as well as exterior shots of the planetoid's surface.[^outward_bound-90] The surface as seen from space during the landing sequence was created by painting a globe white, then mixing chemicals and dyes onto [transparencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_\(projection\) "Transparency (projection)") and projecting them onto it.[^book_of_alien-27][^mcintee,_36-91] The planetoid was not named in the film, but some drafts of the script gave it the name Acheron[^mcintee,_30-16] after [the river](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheron "Acheron") which in [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology") is described as the "stream of woe"; it is a branch of the river [Styx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_\(mythology\) "Styx (mythology)"), and forms the border of [Hell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell") in [Dante](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri")'s *[Inferno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_\(Dante\) "Inferno (Dante)")*. The 1986 sequel *[Aliens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_\(film\) "Aliens (film)")* named the planetoid as "LV-426",[^aliens-87] and both names have been used for it in subsequent [expanded-universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_universe "Expanded universe") media such as comic books and video games.

The title sequence was developed by [R/Greenberg Associates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/GA "R/GA") "to instill a sense of foreboding, the letters broken into pieces, the space between them unsettling."[^92] It is referenced as one of the most iconic opening sequences of all time.[^93]

### Critical reassessment

In a 1980 episode of *[Sneak Previews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneak_Previews "Sneak Previews")* discussing science fiction films of the 1950s and 1970s, the reviewers were critical of *Alien*. [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") reiterated [Gene Siskel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel "Gene Siskel")'s earlier opinion, stating that the film was "basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship". He described it as one of several science fiction pictures that were "real disappointments" compared to *Star Wars*, *[Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind "Close Encounters of the Third Kind")*, and *[2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_\(film\) "2001: A Space Odyssey (film)")*. However, in both episodes Ebert singled out the early scene of the *Nostromo*'s crew exploring the alien planet for praise, calling the scene "inspired", said that it showed "real imagination" and claimed that it transcended the rest of the film.[^sneak_previews-160] Over two decades later, Ebert had revised his opinion, including the film on his [*Great Movies* list](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Movies "The Great Movies"), where he gave it four stars and said it was "a great original".[^161] In 1980, *Alien* was included in *[Cinefantastique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinefantastique "Cinefantastique")*'s list of the top films of the 1970s but failed to make the top ten.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="What number was it placed at? (September 2024)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Frederick S. Clarke, the *Cinefantastique* editor, wrote that *Alien* was "an exercise in style, refreshingly adult in approach, wickedly grim and perverse, that manages to compensate for a lack of depth in both story and characters".[^clarkecinefantastique-162]<sup class="noprint Inline-Template">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s). (May 2024)">verification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In 1982, [John Simon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Simon_\(critic\) "John Simon (critic)") of the *[National Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review "National Review")* praised the cast, particularly Weaver, and the visual values. He wrote: "For fanciers of horror, among whose numbers I do not count myself, *Alien* is recommendable, provided they are free from hypocrisy and finicky stomachs".[^163]

Despite initial mixed reviews, *Alien* has received critical acclaim over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment,[^mackinder_review-83] and is cited one of the best films of 1979.[^164][^165] It is seen as one of the most influential science-fiction films.[^166][^167] It holds a 93% rating on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), based on 203 reviews and an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A modern classic, *Alien* blends science fiction, horror and bleak poetry into a seamless whole."[^168] [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic") reports a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[^169] *[Halliwell's Film Guide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliwell%27s_Film_Guide "Halliwell's Film Guide")* awarded it a full four stars, describing it as "a classic of suspense and art direction".[^halliwell-109] Alan Jones of *[Radio Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Times "Radio Times")* awarded it five out of five, describing it as a "revolutionary 'haunted house in space' thrill-ride \[...\] stunning you with shock after shock", praising the "top-notch acting \[...\] and imaginative bio-mechanical production design", as well as "Ridley Scott's eye for detail and brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of gothic horror and harrowing science fiction".[^170]

Critical interest in the film was re-ignited with the theatrical release of the "Director's Cut" in 2003. Roger Ebert ranked it among "the most influential of modern action pictures" and praised its pacing, atmosphere, and settings:

> One of the great strengths of *Alien* is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underscored by Jerry Goldsmith with scarcely audible, far-off metallic chatterings). It suggests the enormity of the crew's discovery by building up to it with small steps: The interception of a signal (is it a warning or an [SOS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS "SOS")?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who are concerned only about collecting their shares. The masterstroke of the surface murk through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrating the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship ("It's full of ... leathery eggs ...").[^ebert_2003_review-55]

[David A. McIntee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._McIntee "David A. McIntee") praises *Alien* as "possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings."[^mcintee,_41-56] He notes that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. *Alien*, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal."[^mcintee,_41-56] Along with *Halloween* and *[Friday the 13th](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_\(1980_film\) "Friday the 13th (1980 film)")* (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the [slasher film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slasher_film "Slasher film") genre: "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies."[^mcintee,_41-56] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: "Fans of [Hitchcockian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock "Alfred Hitchcock") thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the [hard science fiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction "Hard science fiction") trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim."[^mcintee,_42-171]

[David Edelstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edelstein "David Edelstein") wrote, "*Alien* remains the key text in the 'body horror' subgenre that flowered (or, depending on your viewpoint, festered) in the seventies, and Giger's designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings, got forcibly impregnated, and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate — how's that for future shock? This was truly what [David Cronenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cronenberg "David Cronenberg") would call 'the new flesh,' a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine, machine and alien, and man and alien, with a psychosexual invasiveness that has never, thank God, been equaled."[^edelstein-172]

In 2008, the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") ranked *Alien* the seventh-best science fiction film as part of *[AFI's 10 Top 10](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_10_Top_10 "AFI's 10 Top 10")*, a [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") television special ranking the greatest movies in ten classic American film genres. The ranks were based on a [poll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll "Opinion poll") of over 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians, with *Alien* ranking just above *[Terminator 2: Judgment Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day "Terminator 2: Judgment Day")* (1991) and just below Scott's other science fiction film *[Blade Runner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner "Blade Runner")* (1982).[^afi_poll-173] The same year, *[Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(film_magazine\) "Empire (film magazine)")* named *Alien* the 33rd-greatest film, based on a poll of 10,200 readers, critics, and members of the film industry.[^empire_500-174] In 2021, Phil Pirrello of [Syfy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy "Syfy") named it the second-scariest science fiction film. He described it as a "groundbreaking science fiction classic" and "a movie so influential that it's hard to think of a time before *Alien*".[^175]

[Paisley Abbey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_Abbey "Paisley Abbey") "Alien" [gargoyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyle "Gargoyle") (c. 1990) in [Paisley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley,_Renfrewshire "Paisley, Renfrewshire"), Scotland

> "The 1979 *Alien* is a much more cerebral movie than its sequels, with the characters (and the audience) genuinely engaged in curiosity about this weirdest of lifeforms...Unfortunately, the films it influenced studied its thrills but not its thinking."[^ebert_2003_review-55]

—Film critic [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") on *Alien*'s cinematic impact.

*Alien* had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut, [Dan O'Bannon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_O%27Bannon "Dan O'Bannon") was sued by another writer named Jack Hammer for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled *Black Space*. However, O'Bannon was able to prove that he had written his *Alien* script first.[^mcintee,_40-41-176] In the wake of *Alien*'s success, a number of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its elements, sometimes by using "Alien" in titles. One of the first was *The Alien Dead* (1979), which had its title changed at the last minute to cash in on *Alien*'s popularity.[^mcintee,_262-177] *[Contamination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination_\(film\) "Contamination (film)")* (1980) was initially going to be titled *Alien 2* until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director [Luigi Cozzi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Cozzi "Luigi Cozzi") and made him change it. The film built on *Alien* by having many similar creatures, which originated from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests.[^mcintee,_262-177] An unauthorized sequel to *Alien*, titled *[Alien 2: On Earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_2:_On_Earth "Alien 2: On Earth")*, was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate in humans. Other science fiction films of the time that borrowed elements from *Alien* include *[Galaxy of Terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_of_Terror "Galaxy of Terror")* (1981), *[Inseminoid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inseminoid "Inseminoid")* (1981), *[Forbidden World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_World "Forbidden World")* (1982), *[Xtro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xtro "Xtro")* (1982), and *[Dead Space](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_\(film\) "Dead Space (film)")* (1991).[^mcintee,_262-177]

The "chestburster" effect was parodied in [Mel Brooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks "Mel Brooks")'s comedy *[Spaceballs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs "Spaceballs")*. Near the end, in a diner, John Hurt does a cameo appearance as a customer who seems to be suffering indigestion. He turns out to have an "alien" in his gut, and moans, "Oh, no...not again!" The "alien" then does a song-and-dance, singing a line of "Hello, Ma Baby", from the classic Warner Bros. cartoon *[One Froggy Evening](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Froggy_Evening "One Froggy Evening")*.[^178]

[Nintendo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo "Nintendo")'s long-running *[Metroid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid "Metroid")* video game series, created in 1986, was significantly influenced by *Alien*, both in stylistic and thematic elements. As an homage to *Alien*, villains in [the first *Metroid* installment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_\(video_game\) "Metroid (video game)") were named Ridley and Mother Brain, after the movie's director and the ship computer, respectively.[^179]

Notably, at [Paisley Abbey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_Abbey "Paisley Abbey"), during a restoration project that took place in the 1990s, a stonemason from [Edinburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh") hired to replace twelve crumbling stone [gargoyles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyle "Gargoyle") erected one bearing a strong resemblance to the space creature from the film.[^180][^181] A picture of the gargoyle went viral in 2013, though a photograph of the statue first surfaced on the internet in 1997.[^182] In 2002, it was confirmed the abbey would be subject to a 10-year-long restoration project.

In [SFR Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFR_Yugoslavia "SFR Yugoslavia") the film and its sequels were distributed under the title *Osmi putnik* (transl. *Eighth Traveller*).[^kulturkokoska-183] The highly popular Yugoslav and later [Croatian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia "Croatia") [hard rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock "Hard rock") band [Osmi Putnik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmi_Putnik "Osmi Putnik") chose their name after the film.[^janjatovi%c4%87-184]

In 2002, *Alien* was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the [National Film Preservation Board](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Preservation_Board "National Film Preservation Board") of the United States,[^nfpb_about-185] and was inducted into the [National Film Registry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry "National Film Registry") of the [Library of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") for historical preservation alongside other films of 1979 including *[All That Jazz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That_Jazz_\(film\) "All That Jazz (film)")*, *[Apocalypse Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now "Apocalypse Now")*, *[The Black Stallion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Stallion_\(film\) "The Black Stallion (film)")*, and *[Manhattan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_\(1979_film\) "Manhattan (1979 film)")*.[^national_film_registry-186][^187]

In 2019, author [J. W. Rinzler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._W._Rinzler "J. W. Rinzler") published *The Making of Alien*, a behind-the-scenes book about the making of the film with cast and crew interviews and previously unseen photographs. *[The Verge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge "The Verge")* praised the book as "the definitive story of the classic horror film".[^188]

[Eli Roth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Roth "Eli Roth") cites *Alien* as his primary influence, saying "I saw *Alien* when I was 8 years old. To me, it was like a combination of *Jaws* and *Star Wars* and that's the movie that made me want to be a director. It traumatized me. I actually threw up I was so nervous after I saw it but that's like the highest compliment you can give a horror film."[^189] [Ty Franck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Franck "Ty Franck"), one of the authors behind the sci-fi series *[The Expanse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_\(TV_series\) "The Expanse (TV series)")*, credits *Alien* as one of his major inspirations.[^190]

[Alan Dean Foster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dean_Foster "Alan Dean Foster") wrote a novelization of the film in both adult and "junior" versions, which was adapted from the film's shooting script.[^mcintee,_38-65] *[Heavy Metal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Metal_\(magazine\) "Heavy Metal (magazine)")* magazine published *[Alien: The Illustrated Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_The_Illustrated_Story "Alien: The Illustrated Story")*, a [graphic novel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel "Graphic novel") adaptation of the film scripted by [Archie Goodwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Goodwin_\(comics\) "Archie Goodwin (comics)") and drawn by [Walt Simonson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Simonson "Walt Simonson"), as well as a 1980 *Alien* [calendar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar").[^mcintee,_38-65] Two behind-the-scenes books were released in 1979 to accompany the film. *The Book of Alien* contained many production photographs and details on the making of the film, while *Giger's Alien* contained much of H. R. Giger's concept artwork for the movie.[^mcintee,_38-65] A [model kit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model "Scale model") of the alien, 12 inches high, was released by the [Model Products Corporation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Products_Corporation "Model Products Corporation") in the United States, and by [Airfix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfix "Airfix") in the United Kingdom.[^mcintee,_39-117] [Kenner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenner "Kenner") also produced a larger-scale Alien action figure, as well as a board game in which players raced to be first to reach the shuttle pod while Aliens roamed the *Nostromo*'s corridors and air shafts.[^mcintee,_39-117] Official [Halloween costumes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_costume "Halloween costume") of the alien were released in October 1979.[^mcintee,_39-117]

### School play adaptation

In 2019, students at [North Bergen High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bergen_High_School "North Bergen High School") in New Jersey adapted the film into a play. The production had no budget, with props and sets developed from recycled toys and other items. Social media recognition brought Scott's attention to the play. He wrote a letter of congratulations to the students ("My hat comes off to all of you for your creativity, imagination, and determination") and recommended they consider an adaptation of his film *[Gladiator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_\(2000_film\) "Gladiator (2000 film)")* for their next stage production.[^191] He donated to the school to put on an encore performance at which Weaver was in attendance. She got on stage before the performance to congratulate the cast and crew for their creativity and commitment.[^192]

### Video game adaptation

Separate from the base game's story, two downloadable content packs titled *Crew Expendable* and *Last Survivor* depict alternate versions of key events from the film, with the original cast members Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto reprising their respective roles.[^193]

*Crew Expendable* centers around the events of the movie after Brett's disappearance in the air ducts, prompting the crew to attempt to force the alien into the airlock. Unlike the film, where Dallas would be the first to attempt this while armed with a flamethrower, the game provides the player with the option to play as Ripley, Dallas, or Parker, which would result in the chosen character to enter the ducts first.

*Last Survivor* focuses on the climax of the film, where Ripley is left to be the last crew member and proceeds to self-destruct the *Nostromo*.
