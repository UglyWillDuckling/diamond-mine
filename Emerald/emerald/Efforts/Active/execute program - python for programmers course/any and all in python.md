##  any function

==The  any  function returns  True  if at least one element of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) is true.== If all elements are false, it returns  False .

```python
    >>> any([True, False, True])
    True
    >>> any([False, False, False])
    False
    >>> any(['hello', '', 'world'])
    True
    >>> any(['', '', ''])
    False
```

  In the first example,  any  returns  True  because at least one element in
  the list is  True . In the second example,  any  returns  False  because all
  elements are  False . The third example shows that  any  works with strings,
  and the fourth example shows that an empty string is considered  False .

## all function

  ==The  all  function returns  True  if all elements of an iterable are true.==
  If at least one element is false, it returns  False .

```python
>>> all([True, True, True])
True
>>> all([True, False, True])
False
>>> all(['hello', 'world', 'python'])
True
>>> all(['hello', '', 'world'])
False
```

  In the first example,  all  returns  True  because all elements in the list
  are  True . In the second example,  all  returns  False  because one element
  is  False . The third example shows that  all  works with strings, and the
  fourth example shows that an empty string is considered  False .

## Common use cases

  Both  any  and  all  are often used in conditional statements, such as:

    if any(errors):
        print("There are errors!")

  **or**

    if all(required_fields):
        print("All fields are filled!")

  They can also be used to simplify complex conditions:

```python
if any(x > 10 for x in numbers):
	print("At least one number is greater than 10")
```

  or
    if all(x >= 0 for x in numbers):
        print("All numbers are non-negative")
