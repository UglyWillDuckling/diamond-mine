## WHAT ARE FRANCE IRIS AREAS?

France IRIS Areas are subdivisions within French towns with over 5,000 inhabitants. IRIS stands for ‘Ilots Regroupees pour l’Information Statistique,’ or ‘aggregated units for statistical information.’ These areas vary greatly in population, ranging from areas with a population of 2 MIL +, like Paris, or smaller cities like Chambery, which as of 2024, has a population of 61,640. These areas include both residentail and business units, with 92% of IRIS units being residential, and 5% comprised of businesses (the other 3% is defined by the French government as ‘miscellanous,’ or uninhabitated).

These areas offer a detailed view of regional locations within France, helping you improve your data analytics and better manage sales, marekting, or logistics. It may not seem like it now, but a territory map of France IRIS areas can transform how you manage and adapt to market changes.
