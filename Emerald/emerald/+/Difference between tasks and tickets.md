although not quite defined we may view as the difference between something that is [[ephemeral]], the task, and something more permanent, the [[ticket]].
Very often, tasks can be considered forgetabble or even deletable soon after they are completed.
Example: send images to Natasa, or test this thing here.

Tickets often represent something that we would like to preserve, at least in part, and we definitely want to be able to go back to them after some time, usually when we are working on a related ticket. This way, a web  of (invisible) connections is made between tickets and removing just one of the tickets can break the whole chain.

**Is this always the case**?

No, some tickets are [[ephemeral]] and can be deleted, even then the cost of keeping them is really small.
For tasks on the other hand, the only thing that we want to preserve is time, usually the start and, most importantly, the end date.

**Anything else important about tasks?**

Yes, we should focus here more on the products(artifacts) of tasks, rather  than tasks themeselves. When I'm done with a task I don't really care about it anymore, **but**, I do care what was actually **done** or **created**.

Two categories come to mind here: actions and artificats

*actions*
anything that was done that made changes to something important. These can be deployments, document updates, sent message, even commits.

*artifacts*
Things that were made. Could be tools, scripts, documents...

ðŸ“”there is an obvious overlapping between the 2 groups. Updating is an especially tricky topic, is a change of a document an `artifact`(e.g. a paragraph) or is it just an `action`. ?

**What about tickets**

Tickets are different in  the sense that we regard them by themselves as something of content and value. They contain, usually, information that is relevant and combine with other tickets to form a network of information that is useful in the long run.
This doesn't mean that they don't produce anything, they do, same as *tasks* and often much more, but they also haver inherent qualities that make them valuable.
Connections between tickets are crucial.

**Similiaries between the two**

Both have temporal quality to them so information on time and their position on a timescale is important.
They both produce and create value outside of them.
