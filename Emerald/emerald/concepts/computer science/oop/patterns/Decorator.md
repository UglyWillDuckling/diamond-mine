In object-oriented programming, the `decorator pattern` is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">dynamically</mark>, without affecting the behavior of **other instances of the same class**.[1] The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with **unique areas of concern**[2] as well as to the Open-Closed Principle, by allowing the functionality of a class to be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extended without being modified</mark>.[3] Decorator use can be more efficient than subclassing, because an object's behavior can be augmented without defining an entirely new object.
