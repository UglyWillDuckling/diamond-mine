SAVED BY THE BELL (2020): When California governor Zack Morris gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the most well-funded schools in the state – including Bayside High. The influx of new students gives the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can't be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality.  
  
SAVED BY THE BELL (1989): Saved By The Bell (originally Good Morning, Miss Bliss), features six enterprising, adventurous teenage students with inventive schemes and mischievous dreams. Played by some now iconic actors such as Mario Lopez, Elizabeth Berkley, Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Dustin Diamond, the series follows the teens throughout their fun-filled days at Bayside school and their antic-filled nights at their favorite hangout, The Max. Told from the kids' point of view, Saved By The Bell presents the conflicts and chuckles that teen romances inevitably deliver.
