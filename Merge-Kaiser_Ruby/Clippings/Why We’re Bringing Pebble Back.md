I started working on Pebble [in 2008](https://ericmigi.com/blog/watchduino-first-video) to create the product of my dreams. Smartwatches didnâ€™t exist, so I set out to build one. Iâ€™m extraordinarily happy I was able to help bring Pebble to life, alongside the core team and community. The [company](https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble) [behind it failed](https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble) but millions of Pebbles in the world kept going, many of them still to this day.

I wear my Pebble every day. It's been great (and I'm astounded itâ€™s lasted 10 years!), but the time has come for new hardware.

Youâ€™d *imagine* that smartwatches have evolved considerably since 2012. I've tried every single smart watch out there, but none do it for me. No one makes a smartwatch with the core set of features I want:

- **Always-on e-paper screen** (itâ€™s reflective rather than emissive. Sunlight readable. Glanceable. Not distracting to others like a bright wrist)
- **Long battery life** (one less thing to charge. Itâ€™s annoying to need extra cables when traveling)
- **Simple and beautiful user experience** around a core set of features I use regularly (telling time, notifications, music control, alarms, weather, calendar, sleep/step tracking)
- **Buttons!** (to play/pause/skip music on my phone without looking at the screen)
- **Hackable** (apparently you canâ€™t even write your own watchfaces for Apple Watch? That is wild. There were >16k watchfaces on the Pebble appstore!)

Over the years, weâ€™ve thought about making a new smartwatch. Manufacturing hardware for a product like Pebble is infinitely easier now than 10 years ago. There are plenty of capable factories and Bluetooth chips are cheaper, more powerful and energy efficient.

The challenge has always been, at its heart, software. Itâ€™s the [beautifully designed, fun, quirky](https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebbleos-is-awesome) operating system (OS) that makes Pebble a Pebble.

### **Todayâ€™s big news - Google has open sourced PebbleOS!**

PebbleOS took dozens of engineers working over 4 years to build, alongside our fantastic product and QA teams. Reproducing that for new hardware would take a long time.

Instead, we took a more direct route - I asked friends at Google (which bought Fitbit, which had bought Pebbleâ€™s IP) if they could open source PebbleOS. They said yes! Over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on this. And today is the day - the source code for PebbleOS is now available at [github.com/google/pebble](https://github.com/google/Pebble) (see their [blog post](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html)).

> **Thank you, Google and Rebble!**  
> I can't stress how thankful I am to [Rebble](http://rebble.io/) and Google, in general and to a few Googlers specifically, for putting in tremendous effort over the last year to make this happen. You've helped keep the dream alive by making it possible for anyone to use, fork and improve PebbleOS. The Rebble team has also done a ton of work over the years to continue supporting Pebble software, [appstore](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/watchfaces) and community. Thank you!

In addition to PebbleOS, weâ€™ve been supporting development of [Cobble](https://github.com/pebble-dev/mobile-app), an open source Pebble-compatible app for iOS (soon) and Android (works great today, itâ€™s my daily driver).

### Weâ€™re bringing Pebble back!

I had really, *really,* ***really*** hoped that someone else would come along and build a Pebble replacement. But no one has. Soâ€¦ a small team and I are diving back into the world of hardware to bring Pebble back!

This time round, weâ€™re keeping things simple. Lessons were learned last time! Iâ€™m building a small, narrowly focused company to make these watches. I donâ€™t envision raising money from investors, or hiring a big team. The emphasis is on sustainability. I want to keep making cool gadgets and keep Pebble going long into the future.

The new watch weâ€™re building basically has the same specs and features as Pebble, though with some fun new stuff as well ðŸ˜‰ It runs open source PebbleOS, and itâ€™s compatible with all Pebble apps and watchfaces. If you had a Pebble and loved itâ€¦this is the smartwatch for you.

### Are you like me?

Do you have a hole in your heart (and on your wrist) that hasn't been filled by any other smartwatch?

### FAQ

***When can I buy one?***

As soon as we nail down the product specifications and get a firm idea of the production timeline, we'll share it with everyone on the list and invite people to order.

***Will it be exactly like Pebble?***

Yes. In almost every way.

***Arenâ€™t you the guy who screwed this up last time?***

Yes, the one and only. I think Iâ€™ve learned some [valuable lessons](https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble).
