[[hysteresis ]]

### naming

So, when we combine the prefix, suffix, and nominalizer, we get "hysteresis", which can be roughly translated to "a condition of being in a remembered state" or "a state of retained memory".

**In simpler terms**

Hysteresis refers to the way a system's behavior is influenced by its past states or conditions. It's as if the system has a "`memory`" of its previous behavior, which affects its current behavior.

**Think of it like a rubber band**

Imagine stretching a rubber band. As you stretch it, it resists the force, and when you release it, it snaps back to its original shape. But if you stretch it again, it doesn't respond exactly the same way as it did the first time. It's as if the rubber band "remembers" its previous stretching and responds differently as a result. That's hysteresis in action!

## **Definition**

Hysteresis is a phenomenon characterized by a discontinuity in the relationship between an input parameter and an output response of a system. This discontinuity is a result of the system's internal state or history, which affects its response to subsequent inputs.

### **Mathematical representation**

Hysteresis can be mathematically represented using the concept of a hysteresis loop, which is a closed curve in the input-output plane. The hysteresis loop is defined by two distinct branches:

1. **Upper branch**: The upper branch of the hysteresis loop corresponds to the system's response when the input is increasing. This branch is often denoted as the "ascending branch" or "upper envelope".
2. **Lower branch**: The lower branch of the hysteresis loop corresponds to the system's response when the input is decreasing. This branch is often denoted as the "descending branch" or "lower envelope".

The hysteresis loop can be described using the following mathematical notation:

Let `x` be the input parameter, and `y` be the output response of the system. The hysteresis loop can be represented as:

`y = f(x)`

where `f(x)` is a multivalued function that depends on the history of the input `x`.

### **Characteristics**

Hysteresis exhibits several key characteristics:

1. **Non-linearity**: Hysteresis is a non-linear phenomenon, meaning that the output response `y` is not directly proportional to the input `x`.
2. **Path dependence**: The output response `y` depends on the history of the input `x`, not just its current value.
3. **Memory effect**: Hysteresis systems exhibit a "memory effect", where the system's internal state or history affects its response to subsequent inputs.
4. **Bistability**: Hysteresis systems can exhibit bistability, meaning that they can exist in one of two stable states for a given input range.

### Physical explanations

Hysteresis can be attributed to various physical mechanisms, including:

1. **Energy storage**: Hysteresis can arise from the storage of energy in a system, such as in magnetic or electric fields.
2. **Dissipation**: Hysteresis can result from the dissipation of energy in a system, leading to a lag between the input and output responses.
3. **Non-equilibrium behavior**: Hysteresis can occur in systems that are not in equilibrium, such as in systems with complex internal dynamics or phase transitions.
## **Examples**

Hysteresis is observed in various fields, including:

1. **Magnetism**: Magnetic hysteresis is a fundamental property of ferromagnetic materials, where the magnetization depends on the history of the applied magnetic field.
2. **Electronics**: Hysteresis is used in electronic circuits, such as Schmitt triggers, to create bistable behavior and prevent oscillations.
3. **Biophysics**: Hysteresis is observed in biological systems, such as in the firing of neurons or the response of the immune system, where the history of stimuli affects the response.

### **Physics**

1. **Ferroelectric hysteresis**: Ferroelectric materials exhibit hysteresis in their electric polarization response to an applied electric field.
2. **Superconducting hysteresis**: Superconductors can exhibit hysteresis in their magnetic field response, leading to a lag between the applied field and the superconducting transition.
3. **Optical bistability**: Optical resonators can exhibit hysteresis in their transmission response to incident light, leading to bistable behavior.

1. **Flip-flop circuits**: Flip-flop circuits, such as SRAM cells, exhibit hysteresis in their output response to input signals.
2. **Voltage-controlled oscillators**: Voltage-controlled oscillators can exhibit hysteresis in their frequency response to changes in the control voltage.
3. **Power electronic switches**: Power electronic switches, such as IGBTs and thyristors, can exhibit hysteresis in their conduction response to changes in the gate voltage.
