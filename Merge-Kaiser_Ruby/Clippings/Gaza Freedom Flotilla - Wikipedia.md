**Gaza Freedom Flotilla** vessels and convoys have attempted to break the [blockade of Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Blockade of the Gaza Strip") since 2010. The [first flotilla with six ships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla") was launched by what would then become the [Freedom Flotilla Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_Coalition "Freedom Flotilla Coalition"). It was subsequently [raided by Israeli forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid "2010 Gaza flotilla raid").

Route of the first Gaza Freedom Flotilla, June 2010

Since 2010, attempts from the [Freedom Flotilla II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_II "Freedom Flotilla II") in 2011, [Freedom Flotilla III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_III "Freedom Flotilla III") in 2015, [Women's Boat to Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Boat_to_Gaza "Women's Boat to Gaza") in 2016, Just Future for Palestine Flotilla in [2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "2018 Gaza Freedom Flotilla"), and flotillas in [June](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "June 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla") and [July 2025](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2025_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "July 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla"), have all been intercepted, raided or attacked by Israeli forces.

In August 2025, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition joined the [Global Sumud Flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Sumud_Flotilla "Global Sumud Flotilla"), and began launching a series of flotilla convoys towards Gaza.

## Background

## Timeline

### 2010

The 2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a small [fleet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotilla "Flotilla") of ships by the [Free Gaza Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Gaza_Movement "Free Gaza Movement") and the Turkish [Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHH_\(Turkish_NGO\) "IHH (Turkish NGO)") (İHH). The Flotilla mission to Gaza had the explicit goal of carrying humanitarian aid and construction materials with the intention of breaking the Israeli [blockade of the Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_\(2007-present\) "Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla_FT_Attack-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla_ibhsguardqa53-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla_washingtonpost1-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> In typical circumstances, aid is first brought to Israel to be inspected and then transferred to Gaza.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

On 31 May 2010, Israeli forces [boarded the ships in a raid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid "2010 Gaza flotilla raid") from speedboats and helicopters. Following resistance on one of the boats, nine activists were killed by Israeli forces. Widespread [international condemnation of and reaction to](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_Gaza_flotilla_raid "Reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid") the raid followed, [Israel–Turkey relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Turkey_relations "Israel–Turkey relations") were strained, and Israel subsequently eased its blockade on the Gaza Strip.

Routes of the Gaza-bound flotilla (green) and the Israeli Navy (orange)

[Six civilian ships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla") of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla were raided by Israel on 31 May 2010 in [international waters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters "International waters") in the Mediterranean Sea. Nine of the [flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotilla "Flotilla") passengers were killed during the raid, with 30 wounded (including one who later died of his wounds).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Ten Israeli soldiers were wounded, one seriously. The exact sequence of events is contested, in part due to the IDF's confiscation of the passengers' photographic evidence.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The flotilla, organized by the [Free Gaza Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Gaza_Movement "Free Gaza Movement") and the Turkish [Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (İHH)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHH_\(Turkish_NGO\) "IHH (Turkish NGO)"), was carrying humanitarian aid and construction materials, intending to break the Israeli naval [blockade of the Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%93present_blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip "2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip").

The Israeli Navy warned the flotilla via radio to stop approaching the naval blockade and to change course to the [port of Ashdod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod "Port of Ashdod"). This request was denied and on 31 May 2010, Israeli [Shayetet 13](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shayetet_13 "Shayetet 13") naval commandos boarded the ships in international waters from speedboats <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUN_Palmer_Report201119-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> and helicopters. Aboard the Turkish ship [MV *Mavi Marmara*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Mavi_Marmara "MV Mavi Marmara"), the Israeli Navy faced resistance from about 40 of the 590 passengers, including IHH activists <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> who were said to be armed with iron bars and knives.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUN_Palmer_Report201154%E2%80%9361-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> During the struggle, [nine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Casualties) activists were killed, including eight [Turkish nationals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people") and one [Turkish American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_American "Turkish American"), and many were wounded.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> On 23 May 2014, a tenth member of the flotilla died in hospital after being in a coma for four years.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_imemc.org-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Ten of the commandos were also wounded, one of them seriously.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUN_Palmer_Report201154%E2%80%9361-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_NYT-201005-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>

According to a [United Nations Human Rights Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council "United Nations Human Rights Council") report, all activist deaths were caused by gunshots, and "the circumstances of the killing of at least six of the passengers were in a manner consistent with an extra-legal, arbitrary and summary execution." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_www2.ohchr.org-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The five other ships in the flotilla employed [passive resistance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_resistance "Passive resistance"), which was suppressed without major incident. According to the UNHRC report, several of the passengers were injured and the leg of one was fractured.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_www2.ohchr.org-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The ships were towed to Israel. Some passengers were deported immediately, while about 600 were detained after they refused to sign deportation orders; a few of them were slated for prosecution. After international criticism, all of the detained activists were also deported.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> The raid drew [widespread condemnation internationally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid "Reactions to the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid"), resulted in a deterioration of [Israel–Turkey relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Turkey_relations "Israel–Turkey relations"), and Israel subsequently eased its blockade on the Gaza Strip.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>

There were several probes into the incident. A [UNHRC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHRC "UNHRC") report in September 2010 deemed the raid illegal and stated that Israel's actions were "disproportionate" and "betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality", with evidence of "wilful killing". [United Nations Secretary-General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary-General "United Nations Secretary-General") [Ban Ki-moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon "Ban Ki-moon") announced a parallel probe in August 2010 by a four-member panel headed by [Geoffrey Palmer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Palmer_\(New_Zealand_politician\) "Geoffrey Palmer (New Zealand politician)"). The Palmer report was published in September 2011 and also concluded that the raid was illegal.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_UNpanel5experts-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUN_Palmer_Report20114-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The report stated that the degree of force used against the *Mavi Marmara* was "excessive and unreasonable",<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_Buchan-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> and that the way Israel treated detained crew members violated international human rights law.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_Buchan-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> In response to the raid, Israel offered Turkey $20 million in compensation,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> which was discussed in March 2013,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_bbc220313-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid_CNN220313-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> with an agreement finalized in June 2016.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>

### 2011

" [Freedom Flotilla II – Stay Human](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_II "Freedom Flotilla II") " <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> was a [flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotilla "Flotilla") that planned to break the [maritime blockade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_\(2007-present\) "Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)") of the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") by Israel by sailing to Gaza on 5 July 2011. Ultimately, the sailing did not take place.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>

The flotilla was organized by a coalition of 22 NGOs. Its name refers to the [May 2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla") sailing of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, which had been [raided by Israeli forces, killing a number of activists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Gaza_flotilla_raid "2010 Gaza flotilla raid"). Their stated goal was to end the blockade of Gaza "completely and permanently".<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Initially, 10 ships, with 1,000 activists <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_AJN_24Jun2011a-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> were set to sail for Gaza, but by 28 June 2011, the [number of expected participants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_participants_of_Freedom_Flotilla_II "List of participants of Freedom Flotilla II") had decreased to fewer than 300, plus a few dozen journalists, and by 7 July all but a few dozen activists had returned home.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_Katz-2010-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_Magnezi-28-June-2011-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>

The flotilla was publicly opposed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom, [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), Canada, the [Middle East Quartet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartet_on_the_Middle_East "Quartet on the Middle East") (consisting of the EU, Russia, the United Nations, and the United States), and [United Nations Secretary General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary_General "United Nations Secretary General") [Ban Ki-moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon "Ban Ki-moon"). It was publicly supported by [Hamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_cbc.ca-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>

Activists on two ships, one in Greece and one in Turkey, found similar damage to their propeller shafts, and claimed that the ships had been sabotaged by Israel.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> It was reported that the investigation by Turkish authorities on one of the ships determined that there may have been no sabotage at all, and that any damage happened before the boat arrived in Turkey, but these media reports appeared prior to the formal investigation beginning and the Turkish coastguard enquiry has yet to announce its findings. The media reports were disputed by Irish Ship to Gaza, the owner of the vessel.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_apgreece-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_greece_blocks_boat-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> Greece forbade the vessels from leaving its ports, citing safety concerns,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_greek-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> but offered to instead send any humanitarian aid to Gaza in its own vessels, under United Nations supervision. Greece's offer was supported by Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and the United Nations, but rejected by the flotilla activists.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_voareject-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_bill-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Subsequently, two flotilla ships, the *Audacity of Hope* and *Tahrir*, disobeyed Greece's orders. They were intercepted by the Greek coast guard, brought back to shore, and a few activists were arrested. Activists responded by occupying the Spanish embassy in Athens.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_sunk-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup>

Only the French ship *Dignité Al Karama* managed to approach Gaza. They advised the Greek authorities that their destination was the Egyptian port of [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"),<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> and then turned toward Gaza.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_AlJazeera-2011-07-18-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> On 19 July, the ship was intercepted and boarded without incident by Israeli commandos and escorted to the Israeli port of [Ashdod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod "Ashdod").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_II_BBC-2011-07-19-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup>

### 2015

[Freedom Flotilla III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_III "Freedom Flotilla III") (#FF3) was a [flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotilla "Flotilla") that planned to break the [blockade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_\(2007-present\) "Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)") of the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") by [Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") by sailing to Gaza. It started from [Sweden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden") on 10 May 2015 and stopped in several European cities along the way to Gaza. It started officially from [Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens"), [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece") on 25 June 2015.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_III_MEM-2015-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> Few details were released in advance.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Freedom_Flotilla_III_JP-2015-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup>

On 29 June 2015 the Swedish-flagged vessel "Marianne" was intercepted by the Israeli navy <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> in international waters about 100 nautical miles from the Palestinian coast of [Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"). The Israeli military reported that no force was needed during the operation. However, eye-witness video published by Israeli [Channel 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_2_\(Israel\) "Channel 2 (Israel)") TV shows people being tasered by [IDF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") commandos.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> The *Marianne* was boarded by Israeli forces and taken to the [port of Ashdod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod "Port of Ashdod"), while the rest of the ships turned back.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup>

Organizers of the flotilla have repeatedly stated the boat was carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza. According to Israel's defense minister [Moshe Yaalon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Yaalon "Moshe Yaalon") "there was no aid on board". The activists supplied a picture with two boxes containing a single [solar panel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel "Solar panel") and a [nebulizer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulizer "Nebulizer") and added that the boat was to be donated to Gazan fishermen.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>

On 30 June 2015, Israel began releasing some detainees. Former Tunisian President [Moncef Marzouki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moncef_Marzouki "Moncef Marzouki") was deported to [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), France, while Member of European Parliament [Ana Miranda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Miranda_Paz "Ana Miranda Paz") from [Galicia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_\(Spain\) "Galicia (Spain)") was deported to [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"). [Arab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel "Arab citizens of Israel") Member of the Israeli [Knesset](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset "Knesset") [Basel Ghattas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Ghattas "Basel Ghattas"), and Israeli journalist [Ohad Chamo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ohad_Chamo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ohad Chamo (page does not exist)"), were released.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> Two Canadians and a Norwegian sailor were deported on July 2.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> A Russian journalist and six Swedish participants remained in prison until July 6.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-52"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup>

### 2016

The [Women's Boat to Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Boat_to_Gaza "Women's Boat to Gaza") (WBG) was an initiative by the [Freedom Flotilla Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_Coalition "Freedom Flotilla Coalition") in 2016 to challenge the [Israeli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") [naval blockade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_\(2007-present\) "Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)") of the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> The WBG consisted of an entirely female crew and one ship, *Zaytouna-Oliva*. It started from [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona") on 14 September 2016 and visited [Ajaccio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajaccio "Ajaccio"), [Corsica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica "Corsica") and [Messina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina "Messina"), [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily") along the way.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Women's_Boat_to_Gaza_WBG_FAQ-55"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> On 5 October 2016, the [Israeli Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy "Israeli Navy") intercepted the Women's Boat to Gaza some 14 miles outside the 20-mile "Security Zone" off the Palestinian coast,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Women's_Boat_to_Gaza_Legal_Cases-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> and detained its crew members, who were taken to the Israeli port of [Ashdod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod "Ashdod"). The activists were subsequently deported to their home countries.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Women's_Boat_to_Gaza_The_Telegraph_5_Oct_16-57"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-58"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-59"><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Women's_Boat_to_Gaza_Legal_Cases-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup>

### 2018

The Just Future for Palestine Flotilla, JFP Flotilla or 2018 Gaza Freedom Flotilla was another attempt to challenge the [Israeli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") [blockade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_\(2007-present\) "Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)") of the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"). The flotilla consisted of two ships *Al Awda* (*The Return*) and *Freedom* and two yachts *Mairead* and *Falestine*.

The [Global Sumud Flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Sumud_Flotilla "Global Sumud Flotilla") (GSF; [Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): أسطول الصمود العالمي, [romanized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"): *Usṭūl aṣ-Ṣumūd al-ʿĀlamī*), sometimes referred to as the Global Freedom Flotilla <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-84"><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-85"><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup> (أسطول الحرية العالمي, *Usṭūl al-Ḥurriyya al-ʿĀlamī*), is an international, civil society-led maritime initiative launched in mid-2025, aiming to break the [Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip"). It is named from *[ṣumūd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumud "Sumud")*, [Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") for 'steadfastness' or 'resilience'.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Global_Sumud_Flotilla_:2-86"><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup> The initiative emerged in July 2025, organised by the [Freedom Flotilla Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Flotilla_Coalition "Freedom Flotilla Coalition"), [Global Movement to Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Movement_to_Gaza "Global Movement to Gaza"), and [Maghreb Sumud Flotilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb_Sumud_Flotilla "Maghreb Sumud Flotilla"), among others, during the [Gaza war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war"). The flotilla comprises over 50 vessels with thousands of participants from more than 44 countries, making it the largest civilian-led convoy of its kind in history. Some attempts to break the Israeli blockade were successful before 2010, but since then ships have been intercepted or attacked by Israeli forces, most recently in [June](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "June 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla") and [July](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2025_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "July 2025 Gaza Freedom Flotilla"), with another vessel [attacked by drones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2025_drone_attack_on_Gaza_Freedom_Flotilla "May 2025 drone attack on Gaza Freedom Flotilla") in May 2025. As of September, flotilla convoys have reported three attacks involving drones. In response, three [naval vessels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_vessels "Naval vessels") have been dispatched to provide assistance.

The flotilla began to set sail late August 2025 with delegations and convoys departing [Otranto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otranto "Otranto"), [Genoa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Genoa "Port of Genoa"), and [Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Barcelona "Port of Barcelona"), followed by [Catania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catania "Catania"), [Syros](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syros "Syros"), and [Tunis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis "Tunis") early September. Some convoys initially faced temporary stoppages and delayed departures due to high winds and a significant storm. On 3 September, the Italian convoy reached [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily") and Tunisian vessels began converging on Tunis. Four days later, part of the Spanish convoy arrived in northern Tunisia, where in the early hours of 9 September, a fire broke out on one of the main vessels, suspected to be a drone attack. A second incendiary attack was reported the following night an another vessel. On 19 September, the Spanish and Tunisian convoys, having merged in Silicy, departed heading towards Greece. On 22 September, the Greek convoy then departed from Milos heading towards [Crete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete "Crete"), arriving the following day. On the night of 24 September, eleven vessels were attacked by drones.

The initiative has received support from some over a dozen [foreign ministers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_ministers "Foreign ministers"), Italian politicians and political parties, MPs in Spain and Portugal, the President of Colombia [Gustavo Petro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Petro "Gustavo Petro"), and the [UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Special_Rapporteur_on_the_occupied_Palestinian_territories "UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories"), [Francesca Albanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Albanese "Francesca Albanese"). In contrast, Israeli minister of national security [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir "Itamar Ben-Gvir") has claimed that participants should be imprisoned as [terrorists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist "Terrorist") and the [Israel's foreign ministry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_\(Israel\) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)") vowed to stop the flotilla. In response to the attacks on the flotilla, the [Italian ministry of defense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_\(Italy\) "Ministry of Defence (Italy)") sent the *[Alpino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_frigate_Alpino_\(F_594\) "Italian frigate Alpino (F 594)")* and the *[Virginio Fasan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_frigate_Virginio_Fasan_\(F_591\) "Italian frigate Virginio Fasan (F 591)")*, of the [Italian Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Navy "Italian Navy"), to assist vessels. Spanish Prime Minister [Pedro Sánchez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S%C3%A1nchez "Pedro Sánchez") subsequently dispatched the *[Furor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_patrol_vessel_Furor "Spanish patrol vessel Furor")*, of the [Spanish Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Navy "Spanish Navy"), in case of a rescue operation. The [EU Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission") has otherwise stated that they do not support aid flotillas to Gaza.
