## wiki
The cron command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs[1] (commands or shell scripts), also known as cron jobs, to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.[4] It typically automates system maintenance or administrationâ€”though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.

Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks. Scheduling one-time tasks can be accomplished using the associated [[at]] utility.

> Cron's name originates from [[Chronos]], the Greek word for time.
