The [history of the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines "History of the Philippines") from 1565 to 1898 is known as the **Spanish colonial period**, during which the [Philippine Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Islands "Philippine Islands") were ruled as the [Captaincy General of the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captaincy_General_of_the_Philippines "Captaincy General of the Philippines") within the [Spanish East Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_East_Indies "Spanish East Indies"), initially under the Viceroyalty of [New Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain "New Spain"), based in [Mexico City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City "Mexico City"), until the [independence of the Mexican Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_War_of_Independence "Mexican War of Independence") from Spain in 1821. This resulted in [direct Spanish control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_the_Philippines#Direct_Spanish_control "Governor-General of the Philippines") during a [period of governmental instability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Spain_\(1808%E2%80%931874\)#Trienio_Liberal_\(1820%E2%80%931823\) "History of Spain (1808–1874)") there.

The first documented European contact with the Philippines was made in 1521 by [Ferdinand Magellan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan "Ferdinand Magellan") in his [circumnavigation expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan_expedition "Magellan expedition"),<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> during which he was killed in the [Battle of Mactan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mactan "Battle of Mactan"). Forty-four years later, a Spanish expedition led by [Miguel López de Legazpi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_L%C3%B3pez_de_Legazpi "Miguel López de Legazpi") left modern Mexico and began the Spanish conquest of the Philippines in the late 16th century. Legazpi's expedition arrived in the Philippines in 1565, a year after an earnest intent to colonize the country, which was during the reign of [Philip II of Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain "Philip II of Spain"), whose name has [remained attached to the country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Philippines#Present_name "Names of the Philippines").

The Spanish colonial period ended with the defeat of Spain by the United States in the [Spanish–American War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War "Spanish–American War") and the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1898\) "Treaty of Paris (1898)") on December 10, 1898, which marked the beginning of the [American colonial era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_\(1898%E2%80%931946\) "History of the Philippines (1898–1946)") of Philippine history.

The [Spaniards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards "Spaniards") had been exploring the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines") since the early 16th century.

Philip was in [Brussels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels") at the time and his return to Spain was delayed until 1559 because of European politics and wars in northern Europe. Shortly after his return to Spain, Philip ordered an expedition mounted to the [Spice Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Islands "Spice Islands"), stating that its purpose was "to discover the islands of the west".

The two merchant galleons, Encarnacion and Rosario, which were hastily converted to warships to meet the superior Dutch armada of 18 vessels during the battles of La Naval de Manila in 1646 (artist's conception)

There were three naval actions fought between [Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people "Dutch people") corsairs and Spanish forces in 1610, 1617 and 1624, known as the First, Second and Third [Battles of Playa Honda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Playa_Honda "Battle of Playa Honda"). The second battle is the most famous and celebrated of the three, with nearly even forces (10 ships vs 10 ships), resulting in the Dutch losing their flagship and retreating. Only the third battle of 1624 resulted in a Dutch naval victory.

In 1646, a series of five naval actions known as the Battles of La Naval de Manila was fought between the forces of Spain and the [Dutch Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic"), as part of the [Eighty Years' War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War "Eighty Years' War"). Although the Spanish forces consisted of just two Manila galleons and a [galley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley "Galley") with crews composed mainly of Filipino volunteers, against three separate Dutch squadrons, totaling eighteen ships, the Dutch squadrons were severely defeated in all fronts by the Spanish-Filipino forces, forcing the Dutch to abandon their plans for an invasion of the Philippines.

On June 6, 1647, Dutch vessels were sighted near Mariveles Island. In spite of the preparations, the Spanish had only one galleon (the [*San Diego*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_\(ship\) "San Diego (ship)")) and two galleys ready to engage the enemy. The Dutch had twelve major vessels.

On June 12, the armada attacked the Spanish port of Cavite. The battle lasted eight hours, and the Spanish believed they had done much damage to the enemy flagship and the other vessels. The Spanish ships were not badly damaged and casualties were low. However, nearly every roof in the Spanish settlement was damaged by cannon fire, which particularly concentrated on the cathedral. On June 19, the armada was split, with six ships sailing for the shipyard of Mindoro and the other six remaining in [Manila Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Bay "Manila Bay"). The Dutch next attacked [Pampanga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampanga "Pampanga"), where they captured the fortified monastery, taking prisoners and executing almost 200 Filipino defenders. The governor ordered solemn funeral rites for the dead and payments to their widows and orphans.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-recollect-69"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-affairs-70"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-reize-71"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup>

There was an expedition the following year that arrived in [Jolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolo "Jolo") in July. The Dutch had formed an alliance with an anti-Spanish king, Salicala. The Spanish garrison on the island was small, but survived a Dutch bombardment. The Dutch finally withdrew, and the Spanish made peace with the Joloans, and then also withdrew.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-recollect-69"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-affairs-70"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-reize-71"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup>

  

There was also an unsuccessful attack on [Zamboanga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamboanga_\(province\) "Zamboanga (province)") in 1648. That year the Dutch promised the natives of Mindanao that they would return in 1649 with aid in support of a revolt against the Spanish. Several revolts did break out, the most serious being in the village of Lindáo. There most of the Spaniards were killed, and the survivors were forced to flee in a small river boat to [Butuán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butuan "Butuan"). However, Dutch aid did not materialize or have objects to provide them. The authorities from Manila issued a general pardon, and many of the Filipinos in the mountains surrendered.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-recollect-69"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-affairs-70"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-reize-71"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup>

In August 1759, [Charles III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain "Charles III of Spain") ascended the Spanish throne. At the time, [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain") and [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France") were at war, in what was later called the [Seven Years' War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War "Seven Years' War").

[British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") forces occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764, however they were unable to extend their conquest outside of Manila as the Filipinos stayed loyal to the remaining Spanish community outside Manila.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Basques-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 81–83">: 81–83 </span></sup>  Spanish colonial forces kept the British confined to Manila.

The surrender by Archbishop Rojo was rejected as illegal by Don [Simón de Anda y Salazar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_de_Anda_y_Salazar "Simón de Anda y Salazar"), who claimed the title of Governor-General under the statutes of the [Council of the Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Indies "Council of the Indies"). He led Spanish-Filipino forces that kept the British confined to Manila and sabotaged or crushed British-fomented revolts, such as the revolt by [Diego Silang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Silang "Diego Silang"). Anda intercepted and redirected the Manila galleon trade to prevent further captures by the British. The failure of the British to consolidate their position led to troop desertions and a breakdown of command unity which left the British forces paralysed and in an increasingly precarious position.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-75"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Seven Years' War was ended by the [Peace of Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1763\) "Treaty of Paris (1763)") signed on February 10, 1763. At the time of signing the treaty, the signatories were not aware that Manila was under British occupation and was being administered as a British colony. Consequently, no specific provision was made for the Philippines. Instead they fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for be returned to the Spanish Crown.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-76"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup>

Traders in Manila Adolphe Hastrel.

As industrialization spread throughout Europe and North America in the 19th century, demands for raw materials increased. Although the Philippines had been prohibited from trading with nations other than Spain, the demand led Spain, under Governor-General José Basco, to open the ports to international trade as both as a source of raw materials and as a market for manufactured goods. Following the opening of Philippine ports to world trade in 1834,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-77"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> shifts started occurring within Filipino society.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-78"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-79"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> The decline of the Manila Galleon trade contributed to shifts in the domestic economy. Communal land became privatized to meet international demand for agricultural products, which led to the formal opening of the ports of Manila, [Iloilo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iloilo_City "Iloilo City"), and Cebu to international trade.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cullinane-80"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup>

The opening of Philippine trade to the world gave rise to business and imposing edifices that made Manila the 'Paris of Asia'. La Insular Cigar Factory is one of the most popular.

The development of the Philippines as a source of raw materials and as a market for European manufactures created much local wealth. Many Filipinos prospered. Everyday Filipinos also benefited from the new economy with the rapid increase in demand for labor and availability of business opportunities. Some Europeans immigrated to the Philippines to join the wealth wagon, among them [Jacobo Zóbel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_Z%C3%B3bel "Jacobo Zóbel"), patriarch of today's [Zobel de Ayala family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zobel_de_Ayala_family "Zobel de Ayala family") and prominent figure in the rise of Filipino nationalism. Their scions studied in the best universities of Europe where they learned the ideals of liberty from the French and American Revolutions. The new economy gave rise to a new middle class in the Philippines.

The visit of Gov.-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa at Nueva Caceresr on Feb. 16, 1845.

In the mid-19th century, the [Suez Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal") was opened which made the Philippines easier to reach from Spain. The small increase of *[Peninsulares](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsulares "Peninsulares")* from the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula "Iberian Peninsula") threatened the secularization of the [Philippine churches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_Philippines "Roman Catholicism in the Philippines"). In state affairs, the *[Criollos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criollo_\(people\) "Criollo (people)")*, known locally as *Insulares* (lit. "islanders"), were displaced from government positions by the *Peninsulares*, whom the *Insulares* regarded as foreigners.

The [Spanish American wars of independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_American_wars_of_independence "Spanish American wars of independence") and renewed immigration led to shifts in social identity, with the term *Filipino* shifting from referring to Spaniards born in the Iberian Peninsula and [in the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criollo_people "Criollo people") to a term encompassing all people in the archipelago. This identity shift was driven by wealthy families of mixed ancestry, for which it developed into a national identity.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-81"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-82"><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup> This was compounded by a Mexican of Filipino descent, [Isidoro Montes de Oca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidoro_Montes_de_Oca "Isidoro Montes de Oca"), becoming captain-general to the revolutionary leader [Vicente Guerrero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Guerrero "Vicente Guerrero") during the Mexican War of Independence.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-83"><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-84"><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-85"><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup>

The *Insulares* had become increasingly Filipino and called themselves *Los hijos del país* (lit. "sons of the country"). Among the early proponents of Filipino nationalism were the *Insulares* Padre [Pedro Peláez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pel%C3%A1ez "Pedro Peláez"), who fought for the secularization of Philippine churches and expulsion of the friars, Padre José Burgos whose execution influenced the national hero [José Rizal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Rizal "José Rizal"), and Joaquín Pardo de Tavera who fought for retention of government positions by natives, regardless of race. In retaliation to the rise of Filipino nationalism, the friars called the *Indios* (possibly referring to *[Insulares](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulares "Insulares")* and *[mestizos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_mestizo "Filipino mestizo")* as well) indolent and unfit for government and church positions. In response, the *Insulares* came out with *Indios agraviados*, a manifesto defending the Filipino against discriminatory remarks.

The tension between the *Insulares* and *Peninsulares* erupted into the failed revolts of [Novales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Novales#Novales_revolt "Andrés Novales") and the [Cavite mutiny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1872_Cavite_mutiny "1872 Cavite mutiny") of 1872, which resulted in the deportation of prominent Filipino nationalists to the [Marianas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Islands "Mariana Islands") and [Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), who would continue the fight for liberty through the [Propaganda Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Movement "Propaganda Movement"). The Cavite Mutiny implicated the priests [Mariano Gomez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Gomez_\(priest\) "Mariano Gomez (priest)"), [José Burgos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Burgos "José Burgos"), and [Jacinto Zamora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinto_Zamora "Jacinto Zamora") (see [Gomburza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomburza "Gomburza")), whose executions would influence the subversive activities of the next generation of Filipino nationalists, among them José Rizal, who then dedicated his novel *[El filibusterismo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_filibusterismo "El filibusterismo")* to these priests.

A national [public school system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Philippines_during_Spanish_rule "Education in the Philippines during Spanish rule") was introduced in 1863.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-86"><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-87"><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-88"><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup>

Filipino Ilustrados in Spain

After the Liberals won the [Spanish Revolution of 1868](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1868 "Spanish Revolution of 1868"), [Carlos María de la Torre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Mar%C3%ADa_de_la_Torre_y_Nava_Cerrada "Carlos María de la Torre y Nava Cerrada") was sent to the Philippines to serve as governor-general (1869–1871). He was one of the most loved governors-general in the Philippines because of the reforms he implemented. At one time, his supporters, including Padre Burgos and Joaquín Pardo de Tavera, serenaded him in front of the [Malacañan Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaca%C3%B1an_Palace "Malacañan Palace"). Following the [Bourbon Restoration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration_in_Spain "Bourbon Restoration in Spain") in Spain and the removal of the Liberals from power, de la Torre was recalled and replaced by Governor-General [Izquierdo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_de_Izquierdo_y_Gut%C3%ADerrez "Rafael de Izquierdo y Gutíerrez"), who vowed to rule with an iron fist.

Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three activist Catholic priests were executed on weak pretences.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-89"><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-90"><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cavite_Mutiny-91"><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup> This would inspire a [propaganda movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_movement "Propaganda movement") in Spain, organized by [Marcelo H. del Pilar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_H._del_Pilar "Marcelo H. del Pilar"), José Rizal, and [Mariano Ponce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Ponce "Mariano Ponce"), lobbying for political reforms in the Philippines.

The mass deportation of nationalists to the Marianas and Europe in 1872 led to a Filipino expatriate community of reformers in Europe. The community grew with the next generation of [Ilustrados](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilustrados "Ilustrados") studying in European universities. They allied themselves with Spanish liberals, notably Spanish senator Miguel Morayta Sagrario, and founded the newspaper *[La Solidaridad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Solidaridad "La Solidaridad")*. During this time, Spain institutionalized the business of [human zoos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_zoo "Human zoo") against Filipinos, adding flame to the call of revolution, as indigenous Filipinos were taken by the Spanish and displayed as animals for white audiences.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-92"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-93"><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup>

Among the reformers was José Rizal, who wrote two novels while in Europe. His novels were considered the most influential of the Illustrados' writings, causing further unrest in the islands, particularly the founding of the [Katipunan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katipunan "Katipunan"). A rivalry developed between himself and Marcelo Hilario del Pilar for the leadership of *La Solidaridad* and the reform movement in Europe. Majority of the expatriates supported the leadership of del Pilar.

Rizal then returned to the Philippines to organize [La Liga Filipina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga_Filipina "La Liga Filipina") and bring the reform movement to Philippine soil. He was arrested just a few days after founding the league. Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. This radicalized many who had previously been loyal to Spain.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-ReferenceA1-94"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup> As attempts at reform met with resistance,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-95"><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup> in 1892, Radical members of the La Liga Filipina, which included [Andrés Bonifacio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Bonifacio "Andrés Bonifacio") and [Deodato Arellano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deodato_Arellano "Deodato Arellano"), founded the *Kataastaasan Kagalanggalang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan* (KKK), called simply the Katipunan, which had the objective of the Philippines seceding from the Spanish Empire.

By 1896, the Katipunan had a membership by the thousands. That same year, the existence of the Katipunan was discovered by the colonial authorities. In late August, Katipuneros gathered in [Caloocan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloocan "Caloocan") and declared the start of the revolution. The event is now known as the *[Cry of Balintawak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry_of_Balintawak "Cry of Balintawak")* or the *Cry of Pugad Lawin*, due to conflicting historical traditions and official government positions.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-agoncillop166-96"><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> Andrés Bonifacio called for a general offensive on Manila <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-97"><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-98"><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup> and was defeated in battle at the town of [San Juan del Monte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Metro_Manila "San Juan, Metro Manila").

Spanish counterattacks drove him back and he retreated to the heights of Balara and Morong and from there engaged in [guerrilla warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-guerreropp175-176-99"><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup> By August 30, the revolt had spread to eight provinces. On that date, Governor-General [Ramón Blanco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Blanco,_1st_Marquess_of_Pe%C3%B1a_Plata "Ramón Blanco, 1st Marquess of Peña Plata") declared a [state of war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war") in these provinces and placed them under [martial law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law "Martial law"). These were Manila, [Bulacan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulacan "Bulacan"), Cavite, Pampanga, [Tarlac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarlac "Tarlac"), [Laguna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_\(province\) "Laguna (province)"), [Batangas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batangas "Batangas"), and [Nueva Ecija](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Ecija "Nueva Ecija"). They would later be represented in the eight rays of the sun in the [Filipino flag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Philippines "Flag of the Philippines").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Agoncillop173-100"><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup> [Emilio Aguinaldo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo "Emilio Aguinaldo") and the Katipuneros of [Cavite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavite "Cavite") were the most successful of the rebels <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-101"><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup> and they controlled most of their province by September–October. They defended their territories with [trenches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare "Trench warfare") designed by [Edilberto Evangelista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edilberto_Evangelista "Edilberto Evangelista").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-guerreropp175-176-99"><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup>

Many of the educated *[ilustrado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilustrado "Ilustrado")* class such as [Antonio Luna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Luna "Antonio Luna") and [Apolinario Mabini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolinario_Mabini "Apolinario Mabini") did not initially favor an armed revolution. José Rizal himself, whom the rebels took inspiration from and had consulted beforehand, disapproved of a premature revolution. He was arrested, tried and executed for treason, sedition and conspiracy on December 30, 1896. Before his arrest he had issued a statement disavowing the revolution, but in his farewell poem *[Mi último adiós](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_%C3%BAltimo_adi%C3%B3s "Mi último adiós")* he wrote that dying in battle for the sake of one's country was just as patriotic as his own impending death.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-quibuyen-102"><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup>

While the revolution spread throughout the provinces, Aguinaldo's Katipuneros declared the existence of an insurgent government in October regardless of Bonifacio's Katipunan,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-constantinop178-181-103"><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup> which he had already converted into an insurgent government with him as president in August.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-guerreropp166-167-104"><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-105"><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></a></sup> Bonifacio was invited to Cavite to mediate between Aguinaldo's rebels, the [Magdalo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalo_\(Katipunan_faction\) "Magdalo (Katipunan faction)"), and their rivals the [Magdiwang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdiwang_\(Katipunan_faction\) "Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)"), both chapters of the Katipunan. There he became embroiled in discussions whether to replace the Katipunan with an insurgent government of the Cavite rebels' design. This internal dispute led to the [Tejeros Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejeros_Convention "Tejeros Convention") and an election in which Bonifacio lost his position and Emilio Aguinaldo was elected as the new leader of the revolution.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Duka-106"><span>[</span>105<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 145–147">: 145–147 </span></sup>  On March 22, 1897, the convention established the Tejeros Revolutionary Government. Bonifacio refused to recognize this and, with others, concluded the [Naic Military Agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naic_Military_Agreement "Naic Military Agreement"). This led to his [execution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Bonifacio#Trial_and_sentencing "Andrés Bonifacio") for treason in May 1897.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-107"><span>[</span>106<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-agoncillopp180-181-108"><span>[</span>107<span>]</span></a></sup> On November 1, the Tejeros government was supplanted by the [Republic of Biak-na-Bato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Biak-na-Bato "Republic of Biak-na-Bato").

By December 1897, the revolution had resulted in a stalemate between the colonial government and rebels. [Pedro Paterno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Paterno "Pedro Paterno") mediated between the two sides for the signing of the [Pact of Biak-na-Bato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Biak-na-Bato "Pact of Biak-na-Bato"). The conditions of the armistice included the self-exile of Aguinaldo and his officers in exchange for $MXN 800,000 (about $US 15,200,000 today <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-110"><span>[</span>b<span>]</span></a></sup>) to be paid by the colonial government. Aguinaldo then sailed to [Hong Kong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong "British Hong Kong") to self exile.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-112-113-111"><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup>

On April 25, 1898, the [Spanish–American War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War "Spanish–American War") began. On May 1, 1898, in the [Battle of Manila Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_Bay "Battle of Manila Bay"), the [Asiatic Squadron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_Squadron "Asiatic Squadron") of the [U.S. Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy"), led by Commodore [George Dewey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dewey "George Dewey") aboard [USS *Olympia*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Olympia_\(C-6\) "USS Olympia (C-6)"), decisively defeated the Spanish naval forces in the Philippines. With the loss of its naval forces and of control of Manila Bay, Spain lost the ability to defend Manila and therefore the Philippines.

On May 19, Emilio Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines aboard a U.S. Navy ship, and on May 24, took command of Filipino forces. Filipino forces had liberated much of the country from the Spanish. On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo issued the [Philippine Declaration of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Declaration_of_Independence "Philippine Declaration of Independence") declaring independence from Spain.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-112-113-111"><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup> Filipino forces then laid siege to Manila, as had American forces.

In August 1898, the Spanish governor-general covertly agreed with American commanders to surrender Manila to the Americans following a mock battle. On August 13, 1898, during the [Battle of Manila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_\(1898\) "Battle of Manila (1898)"), Americans took control of the city. In December 1898, the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1898\) "Treaty of Paris (1898)") was signed, ending the Spanish–American War and selling the Philippines to the United States for [$](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") 20 million. With this treaty, Spanish rule in the Philippines formally ended.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-112"><span>[</span>110<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-113"><span>[</span>111<span>]</span></a></sup>

On January 23, 1899, Aguinaldo established the [First Philippine Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Philippine_Republic "First Philippine Republic") in [Malolos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malolos "Malolos").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-114"><span>[</span>112<span>]</span></a></sup>

As it became increasingly clear that the United States would not recognize the First Philippine Republic, the [Philippine–American War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War "Philippine–American War") broke out <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-115"><span>[</span>113<span>]</span></a></sup> on February 4, 1899, with the [Battle of Manila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_\(1899\) "Battle of Manila (1899)").
