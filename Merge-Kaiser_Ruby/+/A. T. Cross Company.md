**A.T. Cross Company, LLC** is an American [manufacturing company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_company "Manufacturing company") of [writing implements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_implement "Writing implement"), based in [Providence, Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island "Providence, Rhode Island"). Founded in 1846, it is one of the oldest pen manufacturers in the world. Cross' products include [fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen "Fountain pen"), [ballpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen "Ballpoint pen"), and [rollerball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollerball_pen "Rollerball pen") pens, [mechanical pencils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_pencil "Mechanical pencil") and refills. The company also manufactures accessories for those goods such as [cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_\(goods\) "Case (goods)") and [wallets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallet "Wallet").

The company has also owned [Sheaffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaffer "Sheaffer"), another pen manufacturer, since 2014.[^3] In August 2022, the Sheaffer brand was sold to the William Penn company.[^4]

The company was founded in 1846 in [Providence, Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island "Providence, Rhode Island"). It initially manufactured gold and silver casings for pencils, reflecting the Cross family's history as jewelers. The company was founded by Richard Cross, who passed it on to his son, Alonzo T. Cross.

The company developed many innovative new writing instruments, including forerunners of the modern mechanical pencils, and the earliest stylographic pens. In the 1960s, the company moved its headquarters to a large facility (about 155,000 square feet)[^projo20160509-5] in [Lincoln, Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Rhode_Island "Lincoln, Rhode Island").[^projo20161222-1]

After trading on the [NASDAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ "NASDAQ") for five years (under the now-defunct symbol ATX), the company was sold in 2013 to Clarion Capital Partners, LLC,[^6] but it retained its headquarters in Lincoln, Rhode Island.[^projo20160509-5] The [Sheaffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaffer "Sheaffer") pen company was acquired by A.T. Cross in 2014.[^7]

In May 2016, with its headquarters in Lincoln becoming too large, the company accepted a set of tax credits and incentives in exchange for moving its headquarters to Providence, Rhode Island.[^projo20160509-5] The new headquarters, measuring about 4200 square feet,[^projo20160509-5] is located at The Foundry, the former [Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_and_Sharpe_Manufacturing_Company_Complex "Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company Complex") at 299 Promenade Street in Providence.[^projo20161222-1] Most employees were moved to the new location by October 2016.[^projo20161222-1] In January 2021, the company moved within the complex to 295 Promenade Street. This was a significantly smaller building, as the company moved to a hybrid work from home scheme due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[^8]

On November 16, 2017, Transom Capital Group, LLC announced that it had bought the assets of A.T. Cross Company.[^9][^transom-2]

President [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") signs his first executive order upon taking office with a black Cross Century II Rollerball[^projo20210121-10]

Cross has been an official supplier of pens to the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") since at least the 1970s. The pens used to sign legislation are often given out as souvenirs to those who attend the bill signings.[^cnn-trump-11]

While an official Cross–White House program was begun under president [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton"), the tradition goes back to at least the administration of [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford "Gerald Ford").[^cnn-trump-11] All presidents from [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") to [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")[^projo20210121-10][^cnn-trump-11][^projo20161222-1] signed legislation using Cross pens; it is unknown if earlier presidents did so.[^projo20161222-1] [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama"), [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") and Clinton favored the Cross Townsend model; Obama later switched to the Century II model in black lacquer, with black medium point refill.[^cnn-trump-11]

The [Trump administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump "First presidency of Donald Trump") placed an initial order for 150 Cross Century II pens in January 2017.[^cnn-trump-11] Sometime before November 2018, Trump broke with tradition and ceased using the Cross pen, saying "it was a horrible pen, and it was extremely expensive."[^bizinsider-12] Thereafter, he signed documents using a customized [Sharpie marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpie_\(marker\) "Sharpie (marker)") manufactured by [Newell Brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell_Brands "Newell Brands").[^bizinsider-12] Joe Biden returned the tradition of Cross Pens to the White House, favoring the same model as Obama, the Century II Rollerball in a black lacquer finish with 23-karat gold-plated appointments.[^projo20210121-10] Biden is reported to use the felt-tip refill unit.[^projo20210121-10]

Cross is well known for its writing instrument lines, beginning with mechanical pencils, and it produced the first stylographic pens (a technological forerunner of the modern [ballpoint pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen "Ballpoint pen")) in 1879. The current product line includes [fountain pens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen "Fountain pen"), ballpoint pens, gel pens, and [mechanical pencils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_pencil "Mechanical pencil").[^13] The first Cross fountain pens were likely produced in 1930, but not again until the 1980s.

Cross writing instruments are generally sold in the mid-range of the market, rather than the extreme luxury end.

Most Cross writing instruments are now made in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), although some of the work for customized pens for presidents and politicians is done in [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England").[^projo20161222-1] The company also manufactures a range of wristwatches, cufflinks, desk accessories and leather goods such as pen cases, portfolios, and other items often targeted at the gift market.

In late 1997, Cross and [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") teamed up to introduce a digital writing pad, called the [CrossPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossPad "CrossPad"), which was discontinued in 2004.[^14]
