- The [[CRM]] is  [[B2B]] 

## quotes'

> - you are our **customers**

## important <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">⚠</mark>

- [[joachim.leistikow]]
	- what this does
		- @ authentication
		- & design
		- etc.
		- we try handle all the `boring` stuff
		- as business agnostic as possible
	- deployment
		- ! production **only 2 times a week** 
	- **responsibilities**
		- its important to handle errors on the application level
			- ! one app can bring the **entire shell** down
		- separated account for every `major brand` #q 
		- `90%` of errors are due to [[asset]]'s
	- _we are your contact for the shell_
	- _you are our customers_
- ! [[me]] this seems **very complicated**

## discussion 🗯
- [?] [[Ivan Culina]] - making a [[Hello World]] app
	- @ [[joachim.leistikow]] bla bla bla
- [?] [[joachim.leistikow]] do you have a timeline - @ [[Paulo]] June/July

- [?] [[Paulo]] [[User authentication]]
	- @ [[joachim.leistikow]] - [[runtime module]]
		- for Okta, we would need to contact another team, #extra-requirement
- [?] [[joachim.leistikow]] - an Epic would help, do you have one?

## decisions ▶
- make a [[Hello World]] app
- talk via [[Slack]]

## other
General connection is with our[[ Runtime Module]]
Details (example [[Okta]]) have to be collected and discovered
1. Step: You connect to the registry with a hello world app (but using your final product identifications)
On `dev stage`

## from [[Slack]]
Thanks everyone for taking the time to meet us :pray::skin-tone-2:
So we understood your project is the CRM for SLMP for B2B.
We added your info to our team overview and will add it to the product overview as soon as a registry exists.
Your Timeline would be:
April: First version of CRM
End of June/July: Prod
Your next steps would be:
Creating a base app based on our template infos
Creating a registry entry with your official Capacity identifier to have the base app integrated on dev stage
As soon as you have more input: The base app would be further developed into the final product
