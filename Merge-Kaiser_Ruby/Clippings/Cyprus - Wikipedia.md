**Cyprus** [^6] ([/ Àà s a…™ p r …ô s /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")), officially the **Republic of Cyprus**,[^7] is an [island country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country "Island country") in the eastern [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"). Situated in [West Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia "West Asia"), its cultural identity and [geopolitical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitical "Geopolitical") orientation are overwhelmingly [Southeast European](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe "Southeast Europe"). Cyprus is the [third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_in_the_Mediterranean "List of islands in the Mediterranean"), after [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily") and [Sardinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia "Sardinia").[^19] [^20] It is located southeast of [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece"), south of [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), west of [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria") and [Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon"), northwest of [Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") and [Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine "Palestine"), and north of [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"). Its capital and largest city is [Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia "Nicosia"). Cyprus hosts the [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories "British Overseas Territories") military bases [Akrotiri and Dhekelia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia "Akrotiri and Dhekelia"), whilst the northeast portion of the island is *[de facto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto "De facto")* governed by the self-declared [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus "Northern Cyprus"), which is separated from the Republic of Cyprus by the [United Nations Buffer Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus "United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus").

Cyprus was first settled by [hunter-gatherers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") around 13,000 years ago, with farming communities emerging by 8500 BC. The late [Bronze Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") saw the emergence of [Alashiya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alashiya "Alashiya"), an urbanised society closely connected to the wider Mediterranean world. Cyprus experienced waves of settlement by [Mycenaean Greeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece "Mycenaean Greece") at the end of the [2nd millennium BC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_millennium_BC "2nd millennium BC"). Owing to its rich natural resources (particularly copper) and strategic position at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia, the island was subsequently contested and occupied by several empires, including the [Assyrians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire "Neo-Assyrian Empire"), [Egyptians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptians "Ancient Egyptians"), and [Persians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire "Achaemenid Empire"), from whom it was seized in 333 BC by [Alexander the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great"). Successive rule by [Ptolemaic Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Dynasty "Ptolemaic Dynasty"), the [Classical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") and [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"), [Arab caliphates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate "Caliphate"), the [French Lusignans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusignan_dynasty "Lusignan dynasty"), and the [Venetians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice "Republic of Venice") was followed by over [three centuries of Ottoman dominion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Cyprus "Ottoman Cyprus") (1571‚Äì1878).[^21] [^8] Cyprus was placed under [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") administration in 1878 pursuant to the [Cyprus Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Convention "Cyprus Convention") and formally annexed by the United Kingdom in 1914.

The island's future became a matter of disagreement between its [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots "Greek Cypriots") and [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots "Turkish Cypriots") communities. Greek Cypriots sought *[enosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis"),* or union with Greece, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s.[^22] [^23] Turkish Cypriots initially advocated for continued British rule, then demanded the annexation of the island to Turkey, with which they established the policy of *[taksim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_\(politics\) "Taksim (politics)"):* portioning Cyprus and creating a Turkish [polity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity "Polity") in the north of the island.[^24] Following [nationalist violence in the 1950s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Emergency "Cyprus Emergency"), Cyprus was [granted independence in 1960](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Z%C3%BCrich_Agreements "London and Z√ºrich Agreements").[^25] The [crisis of 1963‚Äì64](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Christmas_\(1963\) "Bloody Christmas (1963)") brought further [intercommunal violence between the two communities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence "Cypriot intercommunal violence"), displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots into [enclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriot_enclaves "Turkish Cypriot enclaves"),[^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 56‚Äì59">:‚Ää56‚Äì59‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää [^27] and ended Turkish Cypriot political representation. On 15 July 1974, [a coup d'√©tat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cypriot_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1974 Cypriot coup d'√©tat") was staged by [Greek Cypriot nationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA_B "EOKA B") [^28] [^29] and elements of the [Greek military junta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%931974 "Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974").[^30] This action precipitated the [Turkish invasion of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus "Turkish invasion of Cyprus") on 20 July,[^31] which captured the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus and [displaced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_refugees "Cypriot refugees") over 150,000 Greek Cypriots [^32] [^33] and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots.[^34] A separate Turkish Cypriot state in the north was [established by unilateral declaration in 1983](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_the_Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus "Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"), which was widely condemned by the [international community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community "International community") and remains [recognised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition "List of states with limited recognition") only by Turkey. These events and the resulting political situation remain subject to [an ongoing dispute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_dispute "Cyprus dispute").

Cyprus is a [developed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country "Developed country") [representative democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") with an advanced [high-income economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_income_economy "High income economy") and very high [human development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index").[^35] [^36] [^37] The island's intense [Mediterranean climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate") and rich cultural heritage make it a major [tourist destination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Cyprus "Tourism in Cyprus").[^38] Cyprus is a member of the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") and a [founding member](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_and_the_Non-Aligned_Movement "Cyprus and the Non-Aligned Movement") of the [Non-Aligned Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement") until it [joined the European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_in_the_European_Union "Cyprus in the European Union") in 2004;[^39] it joined the [eurozone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone") in 2008.[^40] Cyprus has long maintained [good relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus%E2%80%93NATO_relations "Cyprus‚ÄìNATO relations") with [NATO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") and announced in 2024 its intention to officially join.[^41]

## Etymology

![[~/√ó/7456a3e197da8f09229b28cc748fb19e_MD5.jpg]]

A copper mine in Cyprus. In antiquity, Cyprus was a major source of copper.

The earliest attested reference to *Cyprus* is the 15th¬†century¬†BC [Mycenaean Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek "Mycenaean Greek") êÄìêÄ†êÄ™êÄç, *ku-pi-ri-jo*,[^42] meaning "Cypriot" (Greek: ŒöœçœÄœÅŒπŒøœÇ), written in [Linear B](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B "Linear B") syllabic script.[^43] The classical Greek form of the name is ŒöœçœÄœÅŒøœÇ (*K√Ωpros*).

The etymology of the name is unknown. Suggestions include:

- the Greek word for the [Mediterranean cypress tree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressus "Cupressus") (*[Cupressus sempervirens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressus_sempervirens "Cupressus sempervirens")*), Œ∫œÖœÄŒ¨œÅŒπœÉœÉŒøœÇ (*kyp√°rissos*)
- the Greek name of the [henna tree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsonia_inermis "Lawsonia inermis") (*Lawsonia alba*), Œ∫œçœÄœÅŒøœÇ (*k√Ωpros*)
- an [Eteocypriot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eteocypriot "Eteocypriot") word for copper. It has been suggested, for example, that it has roots in the [Sumerian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language "Sumerian language") word for copper (*zubar*) or for [bronze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") (*kubar*), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.[^44]

Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the [Classical Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin") word for copper through the phrase *aes Cyprium*, "metal of Cyprus", later shortened to *Cuprum*.[^44] [^45]

The standard [demonym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym "Demonym") relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is *[Cypriot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_\(disambiguation\) "Cypriot (disambiguation)")*. The terms *Cypriote* and *Cyprian* (later [a personal name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprian_\(disambiguation\) "Cyprian (disambiguation)")) are also used, though less frequently.

The state's official name in [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") literally translates to "Cypriot Republic" in English, but this translation is not used officially; "Republic of Cyprus" is used instead.

## History

![[~/√ó/dea9f7b110742661b9dcdf1d1440ba74_MD5.jpg]]

Archaeological site of Khirokitia with early remains of human habitation during the Aceramic Neolithic period (reconstruction)

Hunter-gatherers first arrived on Cyprus around 13‚Äì12,000 years ago (11,000 to 10,000 BC), based on dating of sites like [Aetokremnos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetokremnos "Aetokremnos") on the south coast and the inland site of Vretsia Roudias.[^46] The arrival of the first humans coincides with the extinction of the 75 cm (2.46 ft) high [Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_pygmy_hippopotamus "Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus") and 1 metre (3¬†ft 3¬†in) tall [Cyprus dwarf elephant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Dwarf_Elephant "Cyprus Dwarf Elephant"), the only large mammals native to the island.[^47] [Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") farming communities emerged on the island by around 10,500 years ago (8500 BC).[^48]

Remains of an eight-month-old cat were discovered buried with a human body at a separate [Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") site in Cyprus.[^49] The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old (7500 BC), predating [ancient Egyptian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") civilisation and pushing back the [earliest known feline-human association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_cat "Domestication of the cat") significantly.[^50] The remarkably well-preserved Neolithic village of [Khirokitia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khirokitia "Khirokitia") is a UNESCO [World Heritage Site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site"), dating to approximately 6800 BC.[^51]

During the Late [Bronze Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age"), from around 1650 BC Cyprus (identified in whole or part as [Alashiya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alashiya "Alashiya") in contemporary texts) became more connected to the wider Mediterranean world driven by the trade in [copper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper") extracted from the Troodos Mountains, which stimulated the development of urbanised settlements across the island, with records suggesting that Cyprus at this time was ruled by "kings" who corresponded with the leaders of other Mediterranean states (like the [pharaohs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh") of the [New Kingdom of Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt "New Kingdom of Egypt"), as documented in the [Amarna letters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_letters "Amarna letters")).[^52] The first recorded name of a Cypriot king is *Kushmeshusha*, as appears on letters sent to [Ugarit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit "Ugarit") in the 13th century BC.[^53]

At the end of the Bronze Age, the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement.[^54] The first wave consisted of [Mycenaean Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece "Mycenaean Greece") traders, who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC.[^55] [^56] [^57] A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the [Late Bronze Age collapse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse "Late Bronze Age collapse") of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050 BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period.[^57] [^58] Cyprus occupies an important role in [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), being the birthplace of [Aphrodite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite "Aphrodite") and [Adonis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis "Adonis"), and home to [King Cinyras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinyras "Cinyras"), [Teucer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teucer "Teucer") and [Pygmalion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_\(mythology\) "Pygmalion (mythology)").[^59] Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at [Kition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kition "Kition"), which was under [Tyrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon "Tyre, Lebanon") rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC.[^60] Some [Phoenician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia "Phoenicia") merchants who were believed to come from [Tyre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon "Tyre, Lebanon") [colonised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony "Colony") the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c. 850 BC, the Phoenicians rebuilt and reused the sanctuaries \[at the Kathari site\].

Cyprus is at a strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean.[^61] [^62] [^63] It was ruled by the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire "Neo-Assyrian Empire") for a century starting in 708¬†BC, before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually [Achaemenid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire "Achaemenid Empire") rule in 545 BC.[^57] The Cypriots, led by [Onesilus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onesilus "Onesilus"), king of Salamis, joined their fellow Greeks in the [Ionian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionia "Ionia") cities during the unsuccessful [Ionian Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt "Ionian Revolt") in 499 BC against the Achaemenids. The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained inclined towards the Greek world.[^57] During the whole period of the Persian rule, there is a continuity in the reign of the Cypriot kings and during their rebellions they were crushed by Persian rulers from Asia Minor, which is an indication that the Cypriots were ruling the island with directly regulated relations with the Great King and there was not a Persian [satrap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satrap "Satrap").[^64] The Kingdoms of Cyprus enjoyed special privileges and a semi-autonomous status, but they were still considered vassal subjects of the Great King.[^64]

The island was conquered by [Alexander the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great") in 333¬†BC and Cypriot navy helped Alexander during the [siege of Tyre (332 BC)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_\(332_BC\) "Siege of Tyre (332 BC)"). The Cypriot fleet was also sent to help [Amphoterus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphoterus_\(admiral\) "Amphoterus (admiral)").[^65] In addition, Alexander had two Cypriot generals [Stasander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasander "Stasander") and [Stasanor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasanor "Stasanor") both from the [Soli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soli,_Cyprus "Soli, Cyprus") and later both became satraps in Alexander's empire. Following Alexander's death, the [division of his empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Babylon "Partition of Babylon"), and the subsequent [Wars of the Diadochi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Diadochi "Wars of the Diadochi"), Cyprus became part of the [Hellenistic empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization "Hellenistic civilization") of [Ptolemaic Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom"). It was during this period that the island was fully [Hellenised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization "Hellenization"). In 58¬†BC Cyprus was acquired by the [Roman Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") and became [Roman Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Cyprus "Roman Cyprus") in 22 BC.[^57]

### Middle Ages

The [Walls of Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Nicosia "Walls of Nicosia") were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack.

[Kyrenia Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrenia_Castle "Kyrenia Castle") was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians.

When the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 286, Cyprus became part of the East Roman Empire (also called the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire")); the island would remain part of the empire for some 900 years. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.[^66]

Beginning in 649, Cyprus endured repeated attacks and raids launched by [Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate"). Many were quick raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were killed and great wealth carried off or destroyed.[^66] The city of [Salamis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamis,_Cyprus "Salamis, Cyprus") was destroyed and never rebuilt.[^57] Byzantine control remained stronger in the northern coast, the Arabs exerted more influence in the south. In 688, Emperor [Justinian II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_II "Justinian II") and Caliph [Abd al-Malik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Malik_ibn_Marwan "Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan") signed a treaty whereby Cyprus would be paying an equal amount of tribute to the Caliphate and tax to the Empire, but would remain politically neutral to both while being retained as a province administered by the Empire. There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period, and the island entered a period of impoverishment.[^67] Full Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [Nikephoros II Phokas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_II_Phokas "Nikephoros II Phokas") scored decisive victories on land and sea.[^57]

In 1156 [Raynald of Ch√¢tillon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynald_of_Ch%C3%A2tillon "Raynald of Ch√¢tillon") and [Thoros II of Armenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoros_II "Thoros II") brutally sacked Cyprus over a period of three weeks, stealing so much plunder and capturing so many of the leading citizens and their families for ransom, that the island took generations to recover. Several Greek priests were mutilated and sent away to Constantinople.[^68]

In 1185 [Isaac Komnenos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Komnenos_of_Cyprus "Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus"), a member of the Byzantine imperial family, took over Cyprus and declared it independent of the Empire. In 1191, during the [Third Crusade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade "Third Crusade"), [Richard I of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England "Richard I of England") captured the island from Isaac.[^69] He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [Saracens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saracen "Saracen"). A year later Richard sold the island to the [Knights Templar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar "Knights Templar"), who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [Guy of Lusignan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_of_Lusignan "Guy of Lusignan"). His brother and successor [Aimery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimery_of_Cyprus "Aimery of Cyprus") was recognised as [King of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Cyprus "Kingdom of Cyprus") by [Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor").[^57]

Following the death in 1473 of [James II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_Cyprus "James II of Cyprus"), the last Lusignan king, the [Republic of Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice "Republic of Venice") assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [Catherine Cornaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Cornaro "Catherine Cornaro"), reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [Kingdom of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Cyprus "Kingdom of Cyprus") in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine.[^57] The Venetians fortified [Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia "Nicosia") by building the [Walls of Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Nicosia "Walls of Nicosia"), and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed [Limassol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol "Limassol") and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [Famagusta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famagusta "Famagusta") and [Kyrenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrenia "Kyrenia").[^57]

Although the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island [^57] is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek [middle ranks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class "Middle class"),[^70] and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King [John II of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_Cyprus "John II of Cyprus") who married [Helena Palaiologina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Palaiologina "Helena Palaiologina").[^71]

### Ottoman Cyprus

*Cypri insvla nova descript 1573*, Ioannes √° Deutecum f\[ecit\]. Map of Cyprus newly drawn by Johannes van Deutecom, 1573.

In 1570, a full-scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta. Ottoman forces capturing Cyprus [massacred](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_massacre "Cyprus massacre") many Greek and Armenian Christian inhabitants.[^72] The previous Latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a Muslim community.[^73] Soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and Turkish peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from [Anatolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia").[^74] This new community also included banished Anatolian tribes, "undesirable" persons and members of various "troublesome" Muslim sects, as well as a number of new converts on the island.[^75]

[B√ºy√ºk Han](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk_Han "B√ºy√ºk Han"), a [caravanserai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserai "Caravanserai") in Nicosia, is an example of the surviving Ottoman architecture in Cyprus.

The Ottomans abolished the [feudal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudal "Feudal") system previously in place and applied the [millet system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_\(Ottoman_Empire\) "Millet (Ottoman Empire)") to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [Church of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Cyprus "Church of Cyprus") was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") 's constant expansion efforts on the island.[^76] Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials.[^77]

The ratio of Muslims to Christians fluctuated throughout the period of Ottoman domination. In 1777‚Äì78, 47,000 Muslims constituted a majority over the island's 37,000 Christians.[^78] By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000, comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians.[^79] The Muslim population included numerous [crypto-Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-Christians "Crypto-Christians"),[^80] including the [Linobambaki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linobambaki "Linobambaki"), a crypto-Catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the Catholic community by the Ottoman authorities;[^80] [^81] this community would assimilate into the Turkish Cypriot community during British rule.[^82]

As soon as the [Greek War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence "Greek War of Independence") broke out in 1821, several Greek Cypriots left for Greece to join the Greek forces. In response, the Ottoman governor of Cyprus arrested and executed 486 prominent Greek Cypriots, including the Archbishop of Cyprus, [Kyprianos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyprianos_of_Cyprus "Kyprianos of Cyprus"), and four other bishops.[^83] In 1828, modern Greece's first president [Ioannis Kapodistrias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannis_Kapodistrias "Ioannis Kapodistrias") called for union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place.[^84] Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Ottoman Empire, the poverty of most of the people and the ever-present tax collectors fueled Greek nationalism, and by the 20th century the idea of *[union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis")* with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots.[^77]

Under Ottoman rule, numeracy, school enrolment and literacy rates were all low. They persisted some time after Ottoman rule ended, and then increased rapidly during the twentieth century.[^85]

### British Cyprus

In the aftermath of the [Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_\(1877%E2%80%931878\) "Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878)") and the [Congress of Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin "Congress of Berlin"), Cyprus was [leased](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Convention "Cyprus Convention") to the [British Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, Cyprus remained a *[de jure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure "De jure")* Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with [Egypt and Sudan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedivate_of_Egypt "Khedivate of Egypt")) [^21] in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.[^57]

[Greek Cypriot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots "Greek Cypriots") demonstrations for [Enosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis") (union with Greece) in 1930

The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [Suez Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal"), the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War") and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [Central Powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers"), on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus and declared the Ottoman *[Khedivate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedive "Khedive")* of [Egypt and Sudan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedivate_of_Egypt "Khedivate of Egypt") a [*Sultanate* and British protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Egypt "Sultanate of Egypt").[^21] [^57]

In October 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Greece, ruled by King [Constantine I of Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece "Constantine I of Greece"), on the condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British and went to [Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia "Kingdom of Serbia") ‚Äôs assistance, in order to fulfill her Treaty obligations under the [Serbo-Greek pact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%E2%80%93Serbian_Alliance_of_1913 "Greek‚ÄìSerbian Alliance of 1913") of May 1913.[^86] It gave Greece a golden ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù in achieving *[enosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis")* with Cyprus.[^86] Alternatively it was a ‚Äúlost opportunity‚Äù when the [Zaimis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandros_Zaimis "Alexandros Zaimis") administration declined the British proposal.[^86]

In 1923, under the [Treaty of Lausanne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne_\(1923\) "Treaty of Lausanne (1923)"), the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus,[^87] and in 1925 it was declared a British [crown colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown colony").[^57] During the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), many Greek and Turkish Cypriots enlisted in the [Cyprus Regiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Regiment "Cyprus Regiment").

The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to *enosis*. The idea of *enosis* was historically part of the *[Megali Idea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megali_Idea "Megali Idea")*, a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with large Greek populations in the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and [Asia Minor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor "Asia Minor") with a capital in [Constantinople](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople"), and was actively pursued by the [Cypriot Orthodox Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Orthodox_Church "Cypriot Orthodox Church"), which had its members educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the *Megali Idea*, would later found the guerrilla organisation [EOKA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA "EOKA") *(Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston* or National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters).[^88] [^89] The Greek Cypriots viewed the island as historically Greek and believed that union with Greece was a natural right.[^90] In the 1950s, the pursuit of *enosis* became a part of the Greek national policy.[^91]

Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule.[^92] However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for *enosis*, as they saw the union of [Crete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_State "Cretan State") with Greece, which led to the exodus of [Cretan Turks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_Turks "Cretan Turks"), as a precedent to be avoided,[^93] [^94] and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA.[^95] The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to [self-determination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination") from Greek Cypriots.[^90] Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader [Menderes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Menderes "Adnan Menderes") considered Cyprus an "extension of Anatolia", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that "Cyprus is Turkish" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising that the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan "Partition or Death" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Z√ºrich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.[^96] [^97]

In January 1950, the Church of Cyprus organised a [referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_enosis_referendum,_1950 "Cypriot enosis referendum, 1950") under the supervision of clerics and with no Turkish Cypriot participation,[^98] where 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of *enosis*.[^99] [^100] [^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 9">:‚Ää9‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island's population at the time ([census 1946](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Cyprus "Demographics of Cyprus")). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with Greece through armed struggle. At the same time the [Turkish Resistance Organisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Resistance_Organisation "Turkish Resistance Organisation") (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the Turkish Cypriots as a counterweight.[^101] British officials also tolerated the creation of the Turkish underground organisation TMT The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of Cyprus not to act against TMT despite its illegal actions so as not to harm British relations with the Turkish government.[^97]

During British rule, the future of the island became a matter of disagreement between the two prominent ethnic communities, [Greek Cypriots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots "Greek Cypriots"), who made up 77% of the population in 1960, and [Turkish Cypriots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots "Turkish Cypriots"), who made up 18% of the population. From the 19th century onwards, the Greek Cypriot population pursued *[enosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis")*, union with [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece"), which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s.[^102] [^103] The Turkish Cypriot population initially advocated the continuation of the British rule, then demanded the annexation of the island to Turkey, and in the 1950s, together with Turkey, established a policy of *[taksim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_\(politics\) "Taksim (politics)")*, the partition of Cyprus and the creation of a Turkish polity in the north.[^104]

Ethnic map of Cyprus according to the 1960 census

Cyprus was [granted independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Z%C3%BCrich_Agreements "London and Z√ºrich Agreements") in 1960, following an armed campaign spearheaded by EOKA.[^25] As per the [Z√ºrich and London Agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich_and_London_Agreement "Z√ºrich and London Agreement"), Cyprus officially attained independence on 16 August 1960, and at the time had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.[^105] The UK retained the two [Sovereign Base Areas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Base_Areas "Sovereign Base Areas") of [Akrotiri and Dhekelia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia "Akrotiri and Dhekelia"), while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of Greece and Turkey respectively. The Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the [Akritas plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akritas_plan "Akritas plan"), which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan.[^106] Tensions were heightened when Cypriot President Archbishop [Makarios III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarios_III "Makarios III") called for [constitutional changes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich_and_London_Agreement#13_Amendments_proposed_by_Makarios_III "Z√ºrich and London Agreement"), which were rejected by Turkey [^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 17‚Äì20">:‚Ää17‚Äì20‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää and opposed by Turkish Cypriots.[^106]

Intercommunal violence [erupted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Christmas_\(1963\) "Bloody Christmas (1963)") on 21 December 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots,[^107] destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000‚Äì30,000 Turkish Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy;[^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 56‚Äì59">:‚Ää56‚Äì59‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration.[^108] Turkish Cypriots started living in [enclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriot_enclaves "Turkish Cypriot enclaves"). The republic's structure was changed, unilaterally, by Makarios, and Nicosia was divided by the [Green Line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_\(Cyprus\) "Green Line (Cyprus)"), with the deployment of [UNFICYP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNFICYP "UNFICYP") troops.[^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 56‚Äì59">:‚Ää56‚Äì59‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää

In 1964, Turkey threatened to invade Cyprus [^109] in response to the continuing [Cypriot intercommunal violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence "Cypriot intercommunal violence"), but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson "Lyndon B. Johnson") on 5 June, warning that the US would not stand beside Turkey in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of Turkish territory.[^110] Meanwhile, by 1964, *enosis* was a Greek policy and would not be abandoned; Makarios and the Greek prime minister [Georgios Papandreou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Papandreou "Georgios Papandreou") agreed that *enosis* should be the ultimate aim and King [Constantine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Greece "Constantine II of Greece") wished Cyprus "a speedy union with the mother country". Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion.[^111]

The [crisis of 1963‚Äì64](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Christmas_\(1963\) "Bloody Christmas (1963)") had brought further [intercommunal violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence "Cypriot intercommunal violence") between the two communities, displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots into [enclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriot_enclaves "Turkish Cypriot enclaves") [^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 56‚Äì59">:‚Ää56‚Äì59‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää [^27] and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic.

[Varosha (Mara≈ü)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varosha,_Famagusta "Varosha, Famagusta"), a suburb of Famagusta, was abandoned when its inhabitants fled in 1974 and remains under Turkish military control.

On 15 July 1974, the [Greek military junta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%931974 "Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974") under [Dimitrios Ioannides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitrios_Ioannides "Dimitrios Ioannides") carried out a [coup d'√©tat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cypriot_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1974 Cypriot coup d'√©tat") in Cyprus, to [unite the island with Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis").[^112] [^113] [^114] The coup ousted president [Makarios III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarios_III "Makarios III") and replaced him with pro- [enosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis "Enosis") nationalist [Nikos Sampson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Sampson "Nikos Sampson").[^115] In response to the coup,[^9] five days later, on 20 July 1974, the [Turkish army invaded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus "Turkish invasion of Cyprus") the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 [Treaty of Guarantee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guarantee_\(1960\) "Treaty of Guarantee (1960)"). This justification has been rejected by the [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") and the international community.[^121]

The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions in Cyprus, and hundreds of [paratroopers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratroopers "Paratroopers") were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia, where well-armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long-established; while off the Kyrenia coast, Turkish troop ships landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles.[^122] [^123]

Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed,[^124] Turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and the Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself.[^124] The junta in [Athens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens"), and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power. In Nicosia, [Glafkos Clerides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glafkos_Clerides "Glafkos Clerides") temporarily assumed the presidency.[^124] But after the peace negotiations in [Geneva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva "Geneva"), the Turkish government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 August.[^125] The invasion resulted in [Morphou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphou "Morphou"), [Karpass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpass_Peninsula "Karpass Peninsula"), Famagusta and the [Mesaoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesaoria "Mesaoria") coming under Turkish control.

International pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 36% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north.[^126] At the same time, around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots were displaced to the north and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots. Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey, in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using US-supplied equipment during the [Turkish invasion of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus "Turkish invasion of Cyprus") in 1974.[^127] There were 1,534 Greek Cypriots [^128] and 502 Turkish Cypriots [^129] missing as a result of the fighting from 1963 to 1974.

The Republic of Cyprus has *[de jure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure "De jure")* [sovereignty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty") over the entire island, including its [territorial waters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters "Territorial waters") and [exclusive economic zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone "Exclusive economic zone"), with the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of [Akrotiri and Dhekelia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia "Akrotiri and Dhekelia"), which remain under the UK's control according to the [London and Z√ºrich Agreements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London-Z%C3%BCrich_Agreements "London-Z√ºrich Agreements"). However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts: the area under the effective control of the Republic, in the south and west and comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north,[^130] administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, covering about 36% of the island's area. Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the [UN buffer zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus "United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus"). The international community considers the northern part of the island to be territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish forces.[^10] The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law and amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since Cyprus became a member of the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union").[^136]

### Post-division

A map showing the division of Cyprus

After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop [Makarios III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarios_III "Makarios III") to Cyprus in December 1974, Turkish troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the [Turkish Cypriot parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_Republic_\(Northern_Cyprus\) "Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)"), led by the Turkish Cypriot leader [Rauf Denkta≈ü](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauf_Denkta%C5%9F "Rauf Denkta≈ü"), [proclaimed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_the_Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus "Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus") the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is recognised only by Turkey.[^13]

The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the [politics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_dispute "Cyprus dispute") on the island, as well as [Greco-Turkish relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Turkish_relations "Greco-Turkish relations"). [Turkish settlers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_settlers_in_Northern_Cyprus "Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus") have been settled in the north with the encouragement of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot states. The Republic of Cyprus considers their presence a violation of the [Geneva Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Convention "Geneva Convention"),[^26]<sup><span title="Page / location: 56‚Äì59">:‚Ää56‚Äì59‚Ää</span></sup>‚Ää whilst many Turkish settlers have since severed their ties to Turkey and their second generation considers Cyprus to be their homeland.[^137]

The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[^138]

### 21st century

Attempts to resolve the Cyprus dispute have continued. In 2004, the [Annan Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annan_Plan "Annan Plan"), drafted by then UN Secretary General [Kofi Annan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan "Kofi Annan"), was put to a [referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Annan_Plan_referendums,_2004 "Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004") in both Cypriot administrations. 65% of Turkish Cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74% Greek Cypriots voted against the plan, saying that it disproportionately favoured Turkish Cypriots and gave unreasonable influence over the nation to Turkey.[^139] In total, 66.7% of the voters [rejected the Annan Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Annan_Plan_referendum,_2004 "Cypriot Annan Plan referendum, 2004").

On 1 May 2004 Cyprus joined the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"), together with nine other countries.[^140] Cyprus was accepted into the EU as a whole, although the EU legislation is suspended in Northern Cyprus until a final settlement of the Cyprus problem.

Efforts have been made to enhance freedom of movement between the two sides. In April 2003, Northern Cyprus unilaterally eased checkpoint restrictions, permitting Cypriots to cross between the two sides for the first time in 30 years.[^141] In March 2008, a wall that had stood for decades at the boundary between the Republic of Cyprus and the [UN buffer zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus "United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus") was demolished.[^142] The wall had cut across [Ledra Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledra_Street "Ledra Street") in the heart of Nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the island's 32-year division. On 3 April 2008, Ledra Street was reopened in the presence of Greek and Turkish Cypriot officials.[^143] The two sides relaunched reunification talks in 2015,[^144] but these collapsed in 2017.[^145]

The [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") warned in February 2019 that Cyprus was selling [EU passports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passports_of_the_European_Union "Passports of the European Union") to [Russian oligarchs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarch "Russian oligarch"), and thus would allow [organised crime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime "Organized crime") syndicates to infiltrate the EU.[^146] In 2020, leaked documents revealed a wider range of former and current officials from Afghanistan, China, Dubai, Lebanon, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Vietnam who bought a Cypriot citizenship prior to a change of the law in July 2019.[^147] [^148] Since 2020 Cyprus and Turkey have been [engaged in a dispute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus%E2%80%93Turkey_maritime_zones_dispute "Cyprus‚ÄìTurkey maritime zones dispute") over the extent of their [exclusive economic zones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone "Exclusive economic zone"), ostensibly sparked by oil and gas exploration in the area.[^149]

In November 2023, the [Cyprus Confidential](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Confidential "Cyprus Confidential") data leak published by the [International Consortium of Investigative Journalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Consortium_of_Investigative_Journalists "International Consortium of Investigative Journalists") showed the country's financial network entertaining strong links with Russian oligarchs and high-up figures in the Kremlin, supporting the regime of [Vladimir Putin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin").[^150]

In July 2024, on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus, Turkish President Erdoƒüan rejected a United Nations-endorsed plan for a federal government and supported the idea of having two separate states within Cyprus. Greek Cypriots immediately rejected Erdoƒüan's two-state proposal, calling it a "non-starter".[^151]

Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after the [Italian islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Italy "List of islands of Italy") of [Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily") and [Sardinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia "Sardinia"), both in terms of area and population.[^13] It is also the [world's 80th largest by area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area "List of islands by area") and [world's 51st largest by population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_by_population "List of islands by population"). It measures 240 kilometres (149¬†mi) long from end to end and 100 kilometres (62¬†mi) wide at its widest point, with Turkey 75 kilometres (47¬†mi) to the north. It lies between latitudes [34¬∞](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_parallel_north "34th parallel north") and [36¬∞ N](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_parallel_north "36th parallel north"), and longitudes [32¬∞](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/32nd_meridian_east "32nd meridian east") and [35¬∞ E](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/35th_meridian_east "35th meridian east").

Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east and southeast (105 and 108 kilometres (65 and 67 mi), respectively), Israel 200 kilometres (124 mi) to the southeast, The Gaza Strip 427 kilometres (265 mi) to the southeast, Egypt 380 kilometres (236 mi) to the south, and Greece to the northwest: 280 kilometres (174 mi) to the small [Dodecanesian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecanese "Dodecanese") island of [Kastellorizo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastellorizo "Kastellorizo") (Megisti), 400 kilometres (249¬†mi) to [Rhodes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes "Rhodes") and 800 kilometres (497 mi) to the Greek mainland. Cyprus is at the crossroads of three continents, with some sources placing Cyprus in Europe,[^152] [^153] [^154] and some sources placing Cyprus in Western Asia and the Middle East.[^155] [^13]

The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the [Troodos Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troodos_Mountains "Troodos Mountains") and the smaller [Kyrenia Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrenia_Mountains "Kyrenia Mountains"), and the central plain they encompass, the [Mesaoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesaoria "Mesaoria"). The Mesaoria plain is drained by the [Pedieos River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedieos_River "Pedieos River"), the longest on the island. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is [Mount Olympus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus_\(Cyprus\) "Mount Olympus (Cyprus)") at 1,952¬†m (6,404¬†ft), in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of 1,024¬†m (3,360¬†ft). The island lies within the [Anatolian Plate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_Plate "Anatolian Plate").[^156]

Cyprus contains the [Cyprus Mediterranean forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Mediterranean_forests "Cyprus Mediterranean forests") ecoregion.[^157] It had a 2018 [Forest Landscape Integrity Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index "Forest Landscape Integrity Index") mean score of 7.06/10, ranking it 59th globally out of 172 countries.[^158]

[Geopolitically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics "Geopolitics"), the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled [Green Line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_\(Cyprus\) "Green Line (Cyprus)") provides a [buffer zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_zone "Buffer zone") that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, there are [two bases under British sovereignty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Base_Areas "Sovereign Base Areas") on the island: [Akrotiri and Dhekelia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia "Akrotiri and Dhekelia"), covering the remaining 2.74%.

### Climate

The [Troodos Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troodos_Mountains "Troodos Mountains") experience heavy snowfall in winter.

Cyprus has a [subtropical climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics "Subtropics") ‚Äì [Mediterranean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate") and [semi-arid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") type (in the north-eastern part of the island) ‚Äì [K√∂ppen climate classifications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "K√∂ppen climate classification") *Csa* and *BSh*,[^159] [^160] with very mild winters (on the coast) and warm to hot summers. Snow is possible only in the Troodos Mountains in the central part of island. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry.

Cyprus has one of the warmest climates in the Mediterranean part of the European Union.[^161] The average annual temperature on the coast is around 24 ¬∞C (75 ¬∞F) during the day and 14 ¬∞C (57 ¬∞F) at night. Generally, summers last about eight months, beginning in April with average temperatures of 21‚Äì23 ¬∞C (70‚Äì73 ¬∞F) during the day and 11‚Äì13 ¬∞C (52‚Äì55 ¬∞F) at night, and ending in November with average temperatures of 22‚Äì23 ¬∞C (72‚Äì73 ¬∞F) during the day and 12‚Äì14 ¬∞C (54‚Äì57 ¬∞F) at night, although in the remaining four months temperatures sometimes exceed 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F).[^162]

Sunshine hours on the coast are around 3,200 per year, from an average of 5‚Äì6 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12‚Äì13 hours in July.[^163] This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe; for comparison, London receives about 1,540 per year.[^164] In December, London receives about 50 hours of sunshine [^164] while coastal locations in Cyprus about 180 hours (almost as much as in May in London).

### Water supply

[Kouris Dam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouris_Dam "Kouris Dam") overflow in April 2012

Cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased.[^165] Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005. However, since then demand has increased annually ‚Äì a result of local population growth, foreigners moving to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists ‚Äì while supply has fallen as a result of more frequent droughts [^165] ([2006 European heat wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_European_heat_wave "2006 European heat wave"), [2018 European heat wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_European_heat_wave "2018 European heat wave"), [2019 European heat waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_heat_waves "2019 European heat waves"), [2022 European heat waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_heat_waves "2022 European heat waves")).

Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use; Cyprus has a total of 108 dams and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about 330,000,000 m <sup>3</sup> (1.2 √ó 10 <sup>10</sup> cu ft).[^166] Water [desalination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination "Desalination") plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought.

The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.[^167]

Turkey has built a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from [Anamur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamur "Anamur") on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water *(see [Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus_Water_Supply_Project "Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project"))*.

Cyprus is home to a number of [endemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism "Endemism") species, including the [Cypriot mouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_mouse "Cypriot mouse"), the [golden oak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_alnifolia "Quercus alnifolia") and the [Cyprus cedar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrus_brevifolia "Cedrus brevifolia").

[Nikos Christodoulides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides "Nikos Christodoulides"), [President of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Cyprus "President of Cyprus") since February 2023

Cyprus is a [presidential republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_republic "Presidential republic"). The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [universal suffrage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage "Universal suffrage") for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_\(Cyprus\) "House of Representatives (Cyprus)") whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.

The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.

[Presidential Palace, Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Palace,_Nicosia "Presidential Palace, Nicosia")

Since 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [Turkish Cypriot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriot "Turkish Cypriot") seats in the House have remained vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided de facto when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but were recognised only by Turkey. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.

As of 2007, the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_\(Cyprus\) "House of Representatives (Cyprus)") had 56 members elected for a five-year term by [proportional representation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation "Proportional representation"), and three observer members representing the [Armenian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians_in_Cyprus "Armenians in Cyprus"), [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Cyprus "Roman Catholicism in Cyprus") and [Maronite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronites_in_Cyprus "Maronites in Cyprus") minorities. Twenty-four seats were allocated to the [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people") community but have remained vacant since 1964. The political environment was dominated by the communist [AKEL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Working_People "Progressive Party of Working People"), the liberal conservative [Democratic Rally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Rally "Democratic Rally"), the [centrist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism "Centrism") [^168] [Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(Cyprus\) "Democratic Party (Cyprus)"), and the [social-democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy "Social democracy") [EDEK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Social_Democracy "Movement for Social Democracy").

In 2008, [Dimitris Christofias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitris_Christofias "Dimitris Christofias") became the country's first Communist head of state. Due to his involvement in the [2012‚Äì2013 Cypriot financial crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%932013_Cypriot_financial_crisis "2012‚Äì2013 Cypriot financial crisis"), Christofias did not run for re-election in 2013. The Presidential election in 2013 resulted in [Democratic Rally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Rally "Democratic Rally") candidate [Nicos Anastasiades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicos_Anastasiades "Nicos Anastasiades") winning 57.48% of the vote. As a result, Anastasiades was sworn in on 28 February 2013. Anastasiades was re-elected with 56% of the vote in the [2018 presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_presidential_election,_2018 "Cypriot presidential election, 2018").[^169] [^170] On 28 February 2023, [Nikos Christodoulides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides "Nikos Christodoulides"), the winner of the 2023 presidential [election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Cypriot_presidential_election "2023 Cypriot presidential election") run-off, was sworn in as the eighth president of the Republic of Cyprus.[^171]

### Administrative divisions

The Republic of Cyprus is divided into six districts: [Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia_District "Nicosia District"), [Famagusta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famagusta_District "Famagusta District"), [Kyrenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrenia_District "Kyrenia District"), [Larnaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_District "Larnaca District"), [Limassol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol_District "Limassol District") and [Paphos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphos_District "Paphos District").[^172]

[Kyrenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrenia_District "Kyrenia District")

[Dhekelia Power Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhekelia_Power_Station "Dhekelia Power Station")

Cyprus has four [exclaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclave "Exclave"), all in territory that belongs to the [British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia "Akrotiri and Dhekelia"). The first two are the villages of [Ormidhia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormidhia "Ormidhia") and [Xylotymvou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylotymvou "Xylotymvou"). The third is the [Dhekelia Power Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhekelia_Power_Station "Dhekelia Power Station"), which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is the [EAC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_Authority_of_Cyprus "Electricity Authority of Cyprus") refugee settlement. The southern part, even though located by the sea, is also an exclave because it has no [territorial waters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters "Territorial waters") of its own, those being UK waters.[^173]

The [UN buffer zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus "United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus") runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off [Ayios Nikolaos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayios_Nikolaos,_SBA "Ayios Nikolaos, SBA") and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the [Paralimni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralimni "Paralimni") area on the southeast corner of the island into a de facto, though not [de jure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure "De jure"), exclave.

### Foreign relations

The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the following international groups: [Australia Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Group "Australia Group"), [CN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations"), [CE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe"), [CFSP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFSP "CFSP"), [EBRD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBRD "EBRD"), [EIB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Investment_Bank "European Investment Bank"), [EU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU "EU"), [FAO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAO "FAO"), [IAEA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA "IAEA"), [IBRD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBRD "IBRD"), [ICAO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO "ICAO"), [ICC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chamber_of_Commerce "International Chamber of Commerce"), [ICCt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court "International Criminal Court"), [ITUC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade_Union_Confederation "International Trade Union Confederation"), [IDA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Association "International Development Association"), [IFAD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFAD "IFAD"), [IFC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation "International Finance Corporation"), [IHO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHO "IHO"), [ILO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization"), [IMF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), [IMO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Meteorological_Organization "International Meteorological Organization"), [Interpol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol "Interpol"), [IOC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC "IOC"), [IOM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration "International Organization for Migration"), [IPU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union "Inter-Parliamentary Union"), [ITU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU "ITU"), [MIGA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIGA "MIGA"), [NAM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement"), [NSG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Suppliers_Group "Nuclear Suppliers Group"), [OPCW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPCW "OPCW"), [OSCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe"), [PCA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration "Permanent Court of Arbitration"), UN, [UNCTAD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCTAD "UNCTAD"), [UNESCO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO"), [UNHCR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR "UNHCR"), [UNIDO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Industrial_Development_Organization "United Nations Industrial Development Organization"), [UPU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPU "UPU"), [WCL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Confederation_of_Labour "World Confederation of Labour"), [WCO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Customs_Organization "World Customs Organization"), [WFTU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Trade_Unions "World Federation of Trade Unions"), [WHO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO "WHO"), [WIPO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIPO "WIPO"), [WMO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMO "WMO"), [WToO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WToO "WToO"), [WTO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization "World Trade Organization").[^13] [^174]

Cyprus is the 88th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 [Global Peace Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Peace_Index "Global Peace Index").[^175]

### Military

Welcoming ceremony of the former [Russian president](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia") [Dmitry Medvedev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev "Dmitry Medvedev") by the soldiers of the [Cypriot National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_National_Guard "Cypriot National Guard")

The [Cypriot National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_National_Guard "Cypriot National Guard") is the main military institution of the Republic of Cyprus. It is a [combined arms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_arms "Combined arms") force, with land, air and naval elements. Historically all male citizens were required to spend 24 months serving in the National Guard after their 17th birthday, but in 2016 this period of compulsory service was reduced to 14 months.[^176]

Annually, approximately 10,000 persons are trained in recruit centres. Depending on their awarded speciality the conscript recruits are then transferred to speciality training camps or to operational units.

While until 2016 the armed forces were mainly conscript based, since then a large professional enlisted institution has been adopted (Œ£Œ•ŒüŒ†), which combined with the reduction of conscript service produces an approximate 3:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted.

Supreme Court of Justice

The [Cyprus Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Police "Cyprus Police") (Greek: ŒëœÉœÑœÖŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ± ŒöœçœÄœÅŒøœÖ, [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"): *Kƒ±brƒ±s Polisi*) is the only National Police Service of the Republic of Cyprus and is under the Ministry of Justice and Public Order since 1993.[^177]

In "Freedom in the World 2011", Freedom House rated Cyprus as "free".[^178] In January 2011, the Report of the Office of the [United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights "United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights") on the question of Human Rights in Cyprus noted that the ongoing division of Cyprus continues to affect human rights throughout the island "including freedom of movement, human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons, discrimination, the right to life, freedom of religion, and economic, social and cultural rights".[^179] The constant focus on the division of the island can sometimes mask other human rights issues.[^180] Prostitution is rife, and the island has been criticized for its role in the sex trade as one of the main routes of [human trafficking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking "Human trafficking") from Eastern Europe.[^181] [^182]

In 2014, Turkey was ordered by the [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights "European Court of Human Rights") to pay well over $100m in compensation to Cyprus for the invasion;[^183] [Ankara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara "Ankara") announced that it would ignore the judgment.[^184] In 2014, a group of Cypriot refugees and a European parliamentarian, later joined by the Cypriot government, filed a complaint to the International Court of Justice, accusing Turkey of violating the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions "Geneva Conventions") by directly or indirectly transferring [its civilian population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_settlers_in_Northern_Cyprus "Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus") into occupied territory. Other violations of the Geneva and the Hague Conventions‚Äîboth ratified by Turkey‚Äîamount to what archaeologist Sophocles Hadjisavvas called "the organised destruction of Greek and Christian heritage in the north".[^185] These violations include looting of cultural treasures, deliberate destruction of churches, neglect of works of art, and altering the names of important historical sites, which was condemned by the [International Council on Monuments and Sites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Council_on_Monuments_and_Sites "International Council on Monuments and Sites"). Hadjisavvas has asserted that these actions are motivated by a Turkish policy of erasing the Greek presence in Northern Cyprus within a framework of ethnic cleansing. But some perpetrators are just motivated by greed and are seeking profit.[^185] Art law expert Alessandro Chechi has classified the connection of cultural heritage destruction to ethnic cleansing as the "Greek Cypriot viewpoint", which he reports as having been dismissed by two [PACE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Assembly_of_the_Council_of_Europe "Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe") reports. Chechi asserts joint Greek and Turkish Cypriot responsibility for the destruction of cultural heritage in Cyprus, noting the destruction of Turkish Cypriot heritage in the hands of Greek Cypriot extremists.[^186]

## Economy

[Central Bank of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Cyprus "Central Bank of Cyprus")

In the early 21st century, Cyprus boasted a prosperous service-based economy that made it the wealthiest of the ten countries that joined the European Union in 2004.[^187] However, the Cypriot economy was later damaged by the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis "2008 financial crisis") and the [Eurozone crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_sovereign-debt_crisis "European sovereign-debt crisis"). In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need ‚Ç¨ 1.8 billion in foreign aid to support the [Cyprus Popular Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Popular_Bank "Cyprus Popular Bank"), and this was followed by [Fitch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Group "Fitch Group") downgrading Cyprus's credit rating to [junk status](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_status "Junk status").[^188] Fitch stated Cyprus would need an additional ‚Ç¨ 4 billion to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of [Bank of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Cyprus "Bank of Cyprus"), [Cyprus Popular Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Popular_Bank "Cyprus Popular Bank"), and [Hellenic Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Bank "Hellenic Bank"), Cyprus's three largest banks, to the [Greek government-debt crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis "Greek government-debt crisis").[^188]

Cyprus is part of a monetary union, the [eurozone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone") (dark blue) and of the [EU single market](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Market_\(European_Union\) "Internal Market (European Union)").

The [2012‚Äì2013 Cypriot financial crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%932013_Cypriot_financial_crisis "2012‚Äì2013 Cypriot financial crisis") led to an agreement with the [Eurogroup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogroup "Eurogroup") in March 2013 to split Cyprus Popular Bank, into a "bad" bank which would be wound down over time and a "good" bank which would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus. In return for a ‚Ç¨10 billion [bailout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout "Bailout") from the [European Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission"), the [European Central Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank") and the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), often referred to as the "troika", the Cypriot government was required to impose a significant [haircut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haircut_\(finance\) "Haircut (finance)") on [uninsured deposits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_insurance "Deposit insurance"), a large proportion of which were held by wealthy [Russians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians "Russians") who used Cyprus as a [tax haven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven "Tax haven"). Insured deposits of ‚Ç¨100,000 or less were not affected.[^189] [^190] [^191]

Cyprus made a staggering economic recovery in the 2010s,[^192] and according to the 2023 International Monetary Fund estimates, Cyprus' [per capita GDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita "List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita") at [$](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_dollar "International dollar") 54,611 is the highest in [Southern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe "Southern Europe"), though slightly below the European Union average.[^193] Tourism, financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy, and Cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses due its low tax rates and [ease of doing business](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_doing_business_index "Ease of doing business index"). Robust growth was achieved in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the focus placed by Cypriot governments on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union.[^194] The Cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 January 2008, replacing the [Cypriot pound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_pound "Cypriot pound").[^187]

Cyprus is the last EU member fully isolated from energy interconnections and it is expected that it will be connected to European network via the [EuroAsia Interconnector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroAsia_Interconnector "EuroAsia Interconnector"), a 2000 MW [high-voltage direct current](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current "High-voltage direct current") [undersea power cable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_power_cable "Submarine power cable").[^195] [EuroAsia Interconnector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroAsia_Interconnector "EuroAsia Interconnector") will connect Greek, Cypriot, and Israeli power grids. It is a leading Project of Common Interest of the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") and also priority Electricity Highway Interconnector Project.[^196] [^197]

In recent years significant quantities of offshore natural gas have been discovered in the area known as [Aphrodite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_12 "Block 12") (at the exploratory drilling block 12) in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone ([EEZ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEZ "EEZ")),[^198] about 175 kilometres (109 miles) south of Limassol at 33¬∞5'40‚Ä≥N and 32¬∞59'0‚Ä≥E.[^199] However, Turkey's offshore drilling companies have accessed both natural gas and oil resources since 2013.[^200] Cyprus demarcated its maritime border with Egypt in 2003, with Lebanon in 2007,[^201] and with Israel in 2010.[^202] In August 2011, the US-based firm [Noble Energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Energy "Noble Energy") entered into a production-sharing agreement with the Cypriot government regarding the block's commercial development.[^203]

Turkey, which does not recognise the border agreements of Cyprus with its neighbours,[^204] threatened to mobilise its naval forces if Cyprus proceeded with plans to begin drilling at Block 12.[^205] Cyprus's drilling efforts have the support of the US, EU, and UN, and on 19 September 2011 drilling in Block 12 began without any incidents being reported.[^206]

### Infrastructure

The [port of Limassol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Limassol "Port of Limassol"), the busiest in Cyprus

Cyprus is one of only three EU nations in which vehicles drive on the [left-hand side of the road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic "Right- and left-hand traffic"), a remnant of British rule. [A series of motorways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roads_and_motorways_in_Cyprus "Roads and motorways in Cyprus") runs along the coast from [Paphos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphos "Paphos") to [Ayia Napa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayia_Napa "Ayia Napa"), with two motorways running inland to Nicosia, one from Limassol and one from [Larnaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca "Larnaca").

Per capita private car ownership is the 29th-highest in the world.[^207] There were approximately 344,000 privately owned vehicles, and a total of 517,000 registered motor vehicles in the Republic of Cyprus in 2006.[^208] In 2006, plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and other public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") Development Bank. In 2010 the new bus network was implemented.[^209]

Cyprus has two international airports in the government-controlled areas, the busier one being in [Larnaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_International_Airport "Larnaca International Airport") and the other in [Paphos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphos_International_Airport "Paphos International Airport").[^210] The [Ercan International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ercan_International_Airport "Ercan International Airport") is the only active one in the non-government-controlled areas, but all international flights there must have a stopover in Turkey.[^211]

The main [harbours](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour "Harbour") of the island are [Limassol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol_Port "Limassol Port") and [Larnaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca "Larnaca"), which serve cargo, passenger and [cruise ships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship "Cruise ship").

[Cyta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYTA "CYTA"), the [state-owned](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_ownership "Public ownership") telecommunications company, manages most telecommunications and Internet connections on the island. However, following deregulation of the sector, a few private telecommunications companies emerged, including [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Telecom "Monaco Telecom"), [Cablenet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cablenet&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cablenet (page does not exist)"), [OTEnet Telecom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTEnet_Telecom&action=edit&redlink=1 "OTEnet Telecom (page does not exist)"), [Omega Telecom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Omega_Telecom&action=edit&redlink=1 "Omega Telecom (page does not exist)") and [PrimeTel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeTel "PrimeTel"). In the non-government-controlled areas of Cyprus, two different companies administer the mobile phone network: [Turkcell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkcell "Turkcell") and [KKTC Telsim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKTC_Telsim "KKTC Telsim").

## Demographics

Population growth, 1961‚Äì2003 (numbers for the entire island, excluding Turkish settlers residing in Northern Cyprus)

2010 population by age and gender

According to the Republic of Cyprus' website, the population in the government controlled areas was 918,100 at the 2021 Census, with the most populous district being Nicosia (38%), followed by Limassol (28%).[^212] The Nicosia Metropolitan area, consisting of seven municipalities, is the largest urban area on the island with a population of 255,309.[^213]

As per the first population census after independence, carried out in December 1960 and covering the entire island, Cyprus had a total population of 573,566, of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.[^105] [^214] The CIA World Factbook calculated that in 2001, [Greek Cypriots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots "Greek Cypriots") comprised 77%, [Turkish Cypriots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots "Turkish Cypriots") 18%, and others 5% of the total Cypriot population.[^215] [^216]

Due to the inter-communal ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974, an island-wide census was regarded as impossible. Nevertheless, the Cypriot government conducted one in 1973, without the Turkish Cypriot populace.[^217] According to this census, the Greek Cypriot population was 482,000. One year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the total population of Cyprus at 641,000; of whom 506,000 (78.9%) were Greeks, and 118,000 (18.4%) Turkish.[^218] After the military occupation of part of the island in 1974, the government of Cyprus conducted six more censuses: in 1976, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2011 and 2021; these excluded the Turkish population which was resident in non-government-controlled areas of the island.[^214]

In addition to this, the Republic of Cyprus is home to 110,200 foreign permanent residents [^219] and an estimated 10,000‚Äì30,000 undocumented illegal immigrants.[^220] [^216] As of 2011, there were 10,520 people of [Russian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_Cyprus "Russians in Cyprus") origin living in Cyprus.[^221] [^222]

| Nationality | Population (2011) |

According to the 2006 census carried out by Northern Cyprus, there were 256,644 ([de jure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure "De jure")) people living in Northern Cyprus. 178,031 were citizens of Northern Cyprus, of whom 147,405 were born in Cyprus (112,534 from the north; 32,538 from the south; 371 did not indicate what region of Cyprus they were from); 27,333 born in Turkey; 2,482 born in the UK and 913 born in Bulgaria. Of the 147,405 citizens born in Cyprus, 120,031 say both parents were born in Cyprus; 16,824 say both parents born in Turkey; 10,361 have one parent born in Turkey and one parent born in Cyprus.[^223]

In 2010, the [International Crisis Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group "International Crisis Group") estimated that the total population of the island was 1.1 million,[^224] of which there were an estimated 300,000 residents in the north, perhaps half of whom were [either born in Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_settlers_in_Northern_Cyprus "Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus") or are children of such settlers.[^225]

The villages of [Rizokarpaso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizokarpaso "Rizokarpaso") (in Northern Cyprus), Potamia (in Nicosia district) and [Pyla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyla "Pyla") (in [Larnaca District](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_District "Larnaca District")) are the only settlements remaining with a mixed Greek and Turkish Cypriot population.[^226]

[Y-Dna haplogroups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup "Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup") are found at the following frequencies in Cyprus: [J](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_J_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)") (43.07% including 6.20% J1), [E1b1b](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_E1b1b_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)") (20.00%), [R1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)") (12.30% including 9.2% R1b), [F](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_F_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)") (9.20%), [I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_I_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)") (7.70%), [K](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_K_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)") (4.60%), [A](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_A_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)") (3.10%).[^227] J, K, F and E1b1b haplogroups consist of lineages with differential distribution within Middle East, North Africa and Europe.

Outside Cyprus there are significant and thriving diasporas ‚Äì both a [Greek Cypriot diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriot_diaspora "Greek Cypriot diaspora") and a [Turkish Cypriot diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriot_diaspora "Turkish Cypriot diaspora") ‚Äì in the United Kingdom, [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), Greece and Turkey.

According to [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe"), approximately 1,250 [Romani people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") live in Cyprus.[^228]

[Kykkos Monastery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kykkos_Monastery "Kykkos Monastery") in [Pedoulas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedoulas "Pedoulas") (left) and [Hala Sultan Tekke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hala_Sultan_Tekke "Hala Sultan Tekke") near [Larnaca Salt Lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_Salt_Lake "Larnaca Salt Lake") (right)

The majority of Greek Cypriots identify as [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians"), specifically [Greek Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Cyprus "Church of Cyprus"),[^13] [^231] [^232] whereas most Turkish Cypriots are adherents of [Sunni Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam"). The first [President of Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Cyprus "President of Cyprus"), [Makarios III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarios_III "Makarios III"), was an [archbishop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop "Archbishop").

[Hala Sultan Tekke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hala_Sultan_Tekke "Hala Sultan Tekke"), situated near the [Larnaca Salt Lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_Salt_Lake "Larnaca Salt Lake") is an object of [pilgrimage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage "Pilgrimage") for Muslims.

According to the 2001 census carried out in the government-controlled areas,[^233] 94.8% of the population was [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church"), 0.9% [Armenian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_religion_in_Cyprus "Armenian religion in Cyprus") and [Maronite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronite_Church "Maronite Church"), 1.5% [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Church "Latin Church") [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), 1.0% [Church of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England "Church of England"), and 0.6% Muslim. There is also a [Jewish community on Cyprus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Cyprus "History of the Jews in Cyprus"). The remaining 1.3% adhered to other religious denominations or did not state their religion. The Greek Orthodox, [Armenian Apostolic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church "Armenian Apostolic Church"), and both the Maronite and Latin Catholics are constitutionally recognised denominations and exempt from taxes.[^234]

### Languages

The Armenian Alphabet at the [Melkonian Educational Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melkonian_Educational_Institute "Melkonian Educational Institute"). [Armenian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language "Armenian language") is recognised as a minority language in Cyprus.

Cyprus has two official languages, Greek and [Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language").[^235] [Armenian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language "Armenian language") and [Cypriot Maronite Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Maronite_Arabic "Cypriot Maronite Arabic") are recognised as minority languages.[^236] [^237] Although without official status, [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") is widely spoken and features widely on road signs and in public notices and advertisements.[^238] English was the sole official language during British colonial rule and the [lingua franca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca "Lingua franca") until 1960, and continued to be used (de facto) in courts of law until 1989 and in legislation until 1996.[^239] In 2010, 80.4% of Cypriots were proficient in English as a [second language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_language "Second language").[^240] Russian is widely spoken among the country's minorities, residents and citizens of post-Soviet countries, and [Pontic Greeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic_Greeks "Pontic Greeks"). [Russian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"), after English and Greek, is the third language used on many signs of shops and restaurants, particularly in Limassol and Paphos. In addition, in 2006, 12% of the population spoke [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") and 5% spoke [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language").[^241]

The everyday spoken language of Greek Cypriots is [Cypriot Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Greek "Cypriot Greek"), and that of Turkish Cypriots is [Cypriot Turkish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Turkish "Cypriot Turkish").[^239] These [vernaculars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular "Vernacular") both differ from their [standard registers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language "Standard language") significantly.[^239]

### Education

[Faneromeni School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faneromeni_School "Faneromeni School") is the oldest all-girls primary school in Cyprus.

Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education. The high quality of instruction can be attributed in part to the fact that nearly 7% of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden.[^242] Cyprus was ranked 27th in the [Global Innovation Index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index "Global Innovation Index") in 2024.[^243]

State schools are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions. However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.

The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities. Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of [working age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_working_age "Legal working age") who have higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In addition, 47% of its population aged 25‚Äì34 have tertiary education, which is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus.

## Culture

The entrance of the historic [Pancyprian Gymnasium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancyprian_Gymnasium "Pancyprian Gymnasium")

Greek and Turkish Cypriots share many cultural traits, while also possessing some differences. Several traditional foods (such as [souvla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvla "Souvla") and [halloumi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloumi "Halloumi")) and beverages are similar,[^244] as well as expressions and ways of life. Hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both. In both communities, music, dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic, verbal and nonverbal expressions, traditional dances such as [tsifteteli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsifteteli "Tsifteteli"), similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities.[^245] However, the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures, with the Greek Cypriots traditionally being [Greek Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Cyprus "Church of Cyprus") and Turkish Cypriots traditionally being [Sunni Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Muslims "Sunni Muslims"), which has partly hindered cultural exchange.[^246] Greek Cypriots have influences from Greece and Christianity, while Turkish Cypriots have influences from Turkey and [Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam").

The [Limassol Carnival Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol_Carnival_Festival "Limassol Carnival Festival") is an annual [carnival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival "Carnival") which is held at [Limassol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limassol "Limassol"), in Cyprus. The event which is very popular in Cyprus was introduced in the 20th century.[^247]

### Arts

Typical Cypriot architecture in old part of [Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia "Nicosia"), Cyprus

The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10,000 years, following the discovery of a series of [Chalcolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic "Chalcolithic") period carved figures in the villages of [Khoirokoitia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoirokoitia "Khoirokoitia") and [Lempa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempa_\(Lemba\) "Lempa (Lemba)").[^248] The island is the home to numerous examples of high quality religious [icon painting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_painting "Icon painting") from the [Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_in_the_Middle_Ages "Cyprus in the Middle Ages") as well as [many painted churches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_painted_churches_in_Cyprus "List of painted churches in Cyprus"). Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [French Gothic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Gothic_architecture "French Gothic architecture") and Italian [renaissance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture "Renaissance architecture") introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191‚Äì1571).

A well known traditional art that dates at least from the 14th century is the [Lefkara lace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefkara_lace "Lefkara lace"), which originates from the village of [Lefkara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pano_Lefkara "Pano Lefkara"). Lefkara lace is recognised as an [intangible cultural heritage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_cultural_heritage "Intangible cultural heritage") (ICH) by UNESCO, and it is characterised by distinct design patterns, and its intricate, time-consuming production process. Another local form of art that originated from Lefkara is the production of Cypriot Filigree (locally known as *Trifourenio*), a type of jewellery that is made with twisted threads of silver.

In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883‚Äì1958) who studied at the [Academy of Fine Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_di_Venezia "Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia") in Venice.[^249] Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900‚Äì1994) who studied at London's [Royal College of Art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Art "Royal College of Art") and Christophoros Savva (1924‚Äì1968) who also studied in London, at [Saint Martin's School of Art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin%27s_School_of_Art "Saint Martin's School of Art").[^250] In 1960, Savva founded, together with Welsh artist Glyn Hughes, Apophasis \[Decision\], the first independent cultural centre of the newly established Republic of Cyprus. In 1968, Savva was among the artists representing Cyprus in its inaugural Pavilion at the 34th Venice Biennale. English Cypriot Artist [Glyn HUGHES](http://glynhughesart.com/) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20210619052247/http://glynhughesart.com/) 19 June 2021 at the [Wayback Machine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine "Wayback Machine") 1931‚Äì2014.[^251] In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England [^252] while others train at art schools in Greece and local art institutions such as the [Cyprus College of Art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_College_of_Art "Cyprus College of Art"), [University of Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nicosia "University of Nicosia") and the [Frederick Institute of Technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Institute_of_Technology "Frederick Institute of Technology").

One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although [conceptual art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art "Conceptual art") is being rigorously promoted by a number of art "institutions" and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre. Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene.

[Popular music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music "Popular music") in Cyprus is generally influenced by the Greek *[La√Øka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFka "La√Øka")* scene; artists who play in this genre include international [platinum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification "Music recording sales certification") star [Anna Vissi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Vissi "Anna Vissi"),[^253] [^254] [^255] [^256] [Evridiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evridiki "Evridiki"), and [Sarbel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbel "Sarbel"). [Hip hop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music "Hip hop music") and [R&B](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B "Contemporary R&B") have been supported by the emergence of Cypriot rap and the [urban music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_music "Urban music") scene at [Ayia Napa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayia_Napa "Ayia Napa"), while in the last years the [reggae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae "Reggae") scene is growing, especially through the participation of many Cypriot artists at the annual [Reggae Sunjam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae_Sunjam "Reggae Sunjam") festival. Is also noted Cypriot rock music and *[√ântekhno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ntekhno "√ântekhno")* rock is often associated with artists such as [Michalis Hatzigiannis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michalis_Hatzigiannis "Michalis Hatzigiannis") and [Alkinoos Ioannidis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkinoos_Ioannidis "Alkinoos Ioannidis").

[Zeno of Citium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium"), founder of the [Stoic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism") school of philosophy

Literary production of the antiquity includes the *[Cypria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypria "Cypria")*, an [epic poem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry "Epic poetry"), probably composed in the late 7th¬†century¬†BC and attributed to [Stasinus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasinus "Stasinus"). The *Cypria* is one of the first specimens of Greek and European poetry.[^257] The Cypriot [Zeno of Citium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium") was the founder of the [Stoic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism") school of philosophy.

Epic poetry, notably the "acritic songs", flourished during the [Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). Two chronicles, one written by [Leontios Machairas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leontios_Machairas "Leontios Machairas") and the other by [Georgios Boustronios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Boustronios "Georgios Boustronios"), cover the entire Middle Ages until the end of Frankish rule (4th¬†century‚Äì1489). *Po√®mes d'amour* written in medieval Greek Cypriot date back from the 16th¬†century. Some of them are actual translations of poems written by [Petrarch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch"), [Bembo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembo "Bembo"), [Ariosto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariosto "Ariosto") and G.¬†[Sannazzaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_Sannazaro "Jacopo Sannazaro").[^258] Many Cypriot scholars fled Cyprus at troubled times, such as [Ioannis Kigalas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannis_Kigalas "Ioannis Kigalas") (c. 1622‚Äì1687) who migrated from Cyprus to Italy in the 17th century, several of his works have survived in books of other scholars.[^259]

[Ioannis Kigalas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannis_Kigalas "Ioannis Kigalas") (c.‚Äâ1622 ‚Äì1687) was a [Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia "Nicosia") born [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_people "Greek people") Cypriot scholar and professor of philosophy who was largely active in the 17th century.[^260]

### Cinema

The most worldwide known Cypriot director, to have worked abroad, is [Michael Cacoyannis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cacoyannis "Michael Cacoyannis").

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, George Filis produced and directed *Gregoris Afxentiou*, *Etsi Prodothike i Kypros*, and *The Mega Document*. In 1994, Cypriot film production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. In 2000, the annual amount set aside for filmmaking in the national budget was [CYP¬£](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_pound "Cypriot pound") 500,000 (about ‚Ç¨850,000). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the [Council of Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") 's [Eurimages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurimages "Eurimages") Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature films on which a Cypriot was an executive producer have received funding from Eurimages. The first was *I Sphagi tou Kokora* (1996), followed by *Hellados* (unreleased), *To Tama* (1999), and *O Dromos gia tin Ithaki* (2000).[^270]

### Cuisine

Cypriot *[meze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meze "Meze")*

During the medieval period, under the French Lusignan monarchs of Cyprus an elaborate form of courtly cuisine developed, fusing French, Byzantine and Middle Eastern forms. The Lusignan kings were known for importing Syrian cooks to Cyprus, and it has been suggested that one of the key routes for the importation of Middle Eastern recipes into France and other Western European countries, such as blancmange, was via the Lusignan Kingdom of Cyprus. These recipes became known in the West as *vyands de Chypre*, or foods of Cyprus, and the food historian William Woys Weaver has identified over one hundred of them in English, French, Italian and German recipe books of the Middle Ages. One that became particularly popular across Europe in the medieval and early modern periods was a stew made with chicken or fish called *malmonia*, which in English became mawmeny.[^271]

Another example of a Cypriot food ingredient entering the Western European canon is the cauliflower, still popular and used in a variety of ways on the island today, which was associated with Cyprus from the early Middle Ages. Writing in the 12th and 13th centuries the Arab botanists [Ibn al-'Awwam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-%27Awwam "Ibn al-'Awwam") and [Ibn al-Baitar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Baitar "Ibn al-Baitar") claimed the vegetable had its origins in Cyprus,[^272] [^273] and this association with the island was echoed in Western Europe, where cauliflowers were originally known as Cyprus cabbage or *Cyprus colewart*. There was also a long and extensive trade in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, until well into the sixteenth century.[^274]

Cypriot [Halloumi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloumi "Halloumi")

Cypriot style caf√© in an arcade in [Nicosia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia "Nicosia")

Although much of the Lusignan food culture was lost after the fall of Cyprus to the Ottomans in 1571, a number of dishes that would have been familiar to the Lusignans survive today, including various forms of tahini and houmous, zalatina, skordalia and pickled wild song birds called ambelopoulia. [Ambelopoulia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambelopoulia "Ambelopoulia"), which is today highly controversial, and illegal, was exported in vast quantities from Cyprus during the Lusignan and Venetian periods, particularly to Italy and France. In 1533 the English traveller to Cyprus, John Locke, claimed to have seen the pickled wild birds packed into large jars, of which 1200 jars were exported from Cyprus annually.[^275]

Also familiar to the Lusignans would have been [Halloumi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloumi "Halloumi") cheese, which some food writers today claim originated in Cyprus during the Byzantine period [^276] [^277] [^278] although the name of the cheese itself is thought by academics to be of Arabic origin.[^279] There is no surviving written documentary evidence of the cheese being associated with Cyprus before the year 1554, when the Italian historian [Florio Bustron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florio_Bustron "Florio Bustron") wrote of a sheep-milk cheese from Cyprus he called *calumi*.[^279] Halloumi (Hellim) is commonly served sliced, grilled, fried and sometimes fresh, as an appetiser or [meze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meze "Meze") dish.

Seafood and fish dishes include squid, octopus, [red mullet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_mullet "Red mullet"), and [sea bass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_seabass "European seabass"). Cucumber and tomato are used widely in salads. Common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley, pickled cauliflower and beets, asparagus and [taro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro "Taro"). Other traditional delicacies are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as *lountza* (smoked [pork loin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_loin "Pork loin")), charcoal-grilled lamb, [souvlaki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvlaki "Souvlaki") (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and [sheftalia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheftalia "Sheftalia") (minced meat wrapped in [mesentery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery "Mesentery")). *Pourgouri* ([bulgur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgur "Bulgur"), cracked wheat) is the traditional source of carbohydrate other than bread, and is used to make the delicacy [koubes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh "Kibbeh").

Fresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients. Frequently used vegetables include courgettes, green peppers, [okra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okra "Okra"), green beans, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and grape leaves, and pulses such as beans, broad beans, peas, black-eyed beans, chick-peas and lentils. The most common fruits and nuts are pears, apples, grapes, oranges, [mandarines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_orange "Mandarin orange"), nectarines, [medlar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medlar "Medlar"), blackberries, cherry, strawberries, figs, watermelon, melon, avocado, lemon, pistachio, almond, chestnut, walnut, and hazelnut.

Cyprus is also well known for its desserts, including *lokum* (also known as [Turkish delight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_delight "Turkish delight")) and [Soutzoukos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soutzoukos "Soutzoukos").[^280] This island has [protected geographical indication (PGI)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_geographical_indications_in_the_European_Union#General_regime "Protected geographical indications in the European Union") for its *lokum* produced in the village of [Geroskipou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geroskipou "Geroskipou").[^281] [^282]
