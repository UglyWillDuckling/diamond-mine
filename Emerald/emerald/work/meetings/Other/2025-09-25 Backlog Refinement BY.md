### tib-14 Missing Coach Matching Compliance Tracking in BackYard

In the past, when the FR QSL team used the Oxygen matching in a GSheet, they had a report to track how much coaches followed the matching recommendations. Now that the matching process has been integrated into BackYard, this report is no longer updated.

This raises concerns for both B2B and B2C teams:

B2B needs reassurance that the FR QSL team follows the matching recommendations to ensure a fair distribution of leads.

B2C wants to incentivise coaches based on their compliance with the matching recommendations.

To address this, we need to log relevant data in GCP to track coach behavior accurately—focusing on their selection actions rather than post-selection interventions by the quality team.

### de-duplication tib-76
`note: spike`

something already implemented by [[Team Pulsar]]. Related to [[meta user]] feature. Needs to be spiked.

### integration fix
