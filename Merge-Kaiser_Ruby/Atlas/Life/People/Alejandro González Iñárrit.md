**Alejandro González Iñárritu** [^1] (born 15 August 1963) is a Mexican filmmaker primarily known for making modern [psychological drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_drama_\(film_genre\) "Psychological drama (film genre)") films about the [human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition "Human condition"). His most notable films include *[Amores perros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amores_perros "Amores perros")* (2000), *[21 Grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Grams "21 Grams")* (2003), *[Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_\(film\) "Babel (film)")* (2006), *[Biutiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biutiful "Biutiful")* (2010), *[Birdman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdman_\(film\) "Birdman (film)")* (2014), *[The Revenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenant_\(2015_film\) "The Revenant (2015 film)")* (2015), and *[Bardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo,_False_Chronicle_of_a_Handful_of_Truths "Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths")* (2022). His projects have garnered critical acclaim and [numerous accolades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Alejandro_Gonz%C3%A1lez_I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu "List of awards and nominations received by Alejandro González Iñárritu"), including five [Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards").

In 2006, Iñárritu became the [first Mexican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mexican_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees "List of Mexican Academy Award winners and nominees") filmmaker to receive the Best Director Award at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Cannes_Film_Festival "72nd Cannes Film Festival"). Eight years later, he became the first Mexican filmmaker to be nominated as director or producer in the history of the Academy Awards, as well as the first to win for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. In 2019, Iñárritu served as the first Latin American president of the jury for the [72nd Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Cannes_Film_Festival "72nd Cannes Film Festival").

In 2015, Iñárritu was awarded the Academy Award for Best Director for *Birdman* (2014) and a year later received the same award for *The Revenant* (2015), making him the third director to win the award back-to-back, following in the footsteps of [John Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford "John Ford") and [Joseph L. Mankiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_L._Mankiewicz "Joseph L. Mankiewicz"). To date, he is the only director in history to have won the DGA Award for Outstanding Directing two years in a row.

Iñárritu was later awarded a Special Achievement Academy Award for his [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality") installation *[Carne y Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_and_Sand "Flesh and Sand")* (2017), the first ever VR installation to be presented at the Cannes Film Festival.

## Early life

Iñárritu was born on 15 August 1963 in [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City "Mexico City"), the youngest of seven siblings, to Luz María Iñárritu and Héctor González Gama.[^2] [^3] [^4] His maternal grandfather, Alfredo Iñárritu y Ramírez de Aguilar, was a prominent lawyer, judge, and justice of the Supreme Court of Mexico with partial [Basque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basques "Basques") origins. The surname [Iñárritu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu_\(surname\) "Iñárritu (surname)") is of Basque origin.[^5] Héctor was a banker who owned a ranch, but went bankrupt when Iñárritu was five.[^4] [^6] A poor student, Iñárritu was expelled from high school at the age of 16 or 17 due to poor grades and misbehavior.[^4] [^6] [^7] He briefly ran off with a girl from a wealthy family to [Acapulco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acapulco "Acapulco"), having been influenced by the [Miloš Forman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo%C5%A1_Forman "Miloš Forman") film *[Hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_\(film\) "Hair (film)")*, but returned to Mexico City after a week.[^4] [^7]

Soon after, Iñárritu left home and worked as a sailor on cargo boats, taking two trips at the ages of 16 and 18, sailing through the [Mississippi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River "Mississippi River") and then visiting Europe and Africa. With $1,000 supplied by his father, Iñárritu stayed in Europe for a year on the second trip.[^8] [^9] Around this time, Iñárritu had the opportunity to watch the [Palme d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") -winning film *[Yol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yol_\(film\) "Yol (film)")* by world-famous [Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds "Kurds") director [Yılmaz Güney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C4%B1lmaz_G%C3%BCney "Yılmaz Güney").[^10] Iñárritu was very impressed by *Yol* and later said in interviews that this film was the reason he turned to cinema.[^10] According to some Turkish journalists, the scene in *[The Revenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenant_\(2015_film\) "The Revenant (2015 film)")* (2015) where [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio "Leonardo DiCaprio") enters the belly of a dying horse was a reference to Yılmaz Güney and his film *Yol*, because there was a similar scene in that film.[^11] [^12]

He has noted that these early travels as a young man have had a great influence on him as a filmmaker,[^9] and the settings of his films have often been in the places he visited during this period.[^7] After his travels, Iñárritu returned to Mexico City and majored in [communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications "Communications") at [Universidad Iberoamericana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidad_Iberoamericana "Universidad Iberoamericana").[^13]

## Career

Iñárritu began his career in 1984 as a radio host at the Mexican radio station [WFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEW-AM "XEW-AM"), the country's most popular rock music station, where he "pieced together playlists into a loose narrative arc".[^9] [^13] He worked with and interviewed artists like Robert Plant, David Gilmour, Elton John, Bob Geldof and Carlos Santana. He also wrote and broadcast small audio stories and storytelling promos. He later became the youngest producer for [Televisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televisa "Televisa"), the largest [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media "Mass media") company in [Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America").[^13] From 1987 to 1989, he composed music for six Mexican feature films. During this time, Iñárritu became acquainted with Mexican writer [Guillermo Arriaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Arriaga "Guillermo Arriaga"), beginning their screenwriting collaborations.[^13] Iñárritu has stated that he believes music has had a bigger influence on him as an artist than film itself.[^9] In the early 1990s, Iñárritu created Z Films, a production company, with Raúl Olvera in Mexico.[^14] Under Z Films, he started writing, producing and directing short films and advertisements.[^13] Making the final transition into TV and film directing, he studied under well-known theater director [Ludwik Margules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwik_Margules "Ludwik Margules"), as well as Judith Weston in Los Angeles.[^15] [^16] In 1995, Iñárritu wrote and directed his first TV pilot for Z Films, called *Detrás del dinero*, or *Behind the Money*, starring [Miguel Bosé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Bos%C3%A9 "Miguel Bosé").[^14]

Iñárritu and Cate Blanchett on the set of Babel

In 2000, Iñárritu directed his first feature film *[Amores perros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amores_perros "Amores perros")*, written by [Guillermo Arriaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Arriaga "Guillermo Arriaga").[^13] *Amores perros* explored Mexican society in Mexico City told via three intertwining stories. In 2000, *Amores perros* premiered at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") and won the [Critics' Week Grand Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Critics%27_Week "International Critics' Week").[^17] It was the film debut of actor [Gael García Bernal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gael_Garc%C3%ADa_Bernal "Gael García Bernal"), who would later appear in *[Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_\(film\) "Babel (film)")* and the Iñárritu-produced Mexican film *[Rudo y Cursi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudo_y_Cursi "Rudo y Cursi")*. *Amores perros* was the first installment in Iñárritu's and Arriaga's thematic "Death trilogy", and nominated for the [Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film "Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film").[^18] [^19] In 2002, Iñárritu directed "Powder Keg", an episode for the [BMW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW "BMW") short film series *[The Hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hire "The Hire")*, starring [Clive Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Owen "Clive Owen") as the driver and [Stellan Skarsgård](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellan_Skarsg%C3%A5rd "Stellan Skarsgård") as a war photographer. It won the Cannes Gold Lion Advertising Award.[^20]

After the success of *Amores Perros*, Iñárritu and Arriaga revisited the intersected-stories structure of *Amores perros* in Iñárritu's second feature film, *[21 Grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Grams "21 Grams")* (2003).[^13] The film starred [Benicio del Toro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benicio_del_Toro "Benicio del Toro"), [Naomi Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Watts "Naomi Watts") and [Sean Penn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn "Sean Penn"). It was selected to compete for the [Golden Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lion "Golden Lion") at the [Venice Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival "Venice Film Festival"), where Penn received the [Volpi Cup for Best Actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volpi_Cup_for_Best_Actor "Volpi Cup for Best Actor").[^21] [^22] At the [76th Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/76th_Academy_Awards "76th Academy Awards"), Del Toro and Watts received nominations for their performances.[^23] From 2001 to 2011, Iñárritu directed several [short films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_films "Short films"). In 2001, he directed an 11-minute film segment for *[11'09"01 September 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11%2709%2201_September_11 "11'09\"01 September 11")* - which is composed of several short films that explore the effects of the [9/11 terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks") from different points of view around the world.[^13] In 2007, he made *ANNA*, part of French [anthology film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_film "Anthology film") *[Chacun son cinéma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacun_son_cin%C3%A9ma "Chacun son cinéma")*, which screened at the [2007 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Cannes_Film_Festival "2007 Cannes Film Festival"). *Chacun son cinéma*, a collection of 33 short films by 35 renowned film directors representing 25 countries, was produced for the 60th anniversary of the film festival.[^24] In 2012, Iñárritu made the experimental short film *Naran Ja: One Act Orange Dance*, inspired by L.A Dance Project's premiere performance, featuring excerpts from the new choreography [Benjamin Millepied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Millepied "Benjamin Millepied") crafted for *Moving Parts*. The story takes place in a secluded, dusty space and centers around LADP dancer Julia Eichten.[^25]

Iñárritu embarked on his third and last film that formed the "Death Trilogy", *Babel* (2006), written again by Arriaga.[^26] [^27] [^28] *Babel* comprises four interrelated stories set in [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "Morocco"), Mexico, the United States, and Japan, in four different languages.[^29] The film stars [Brad Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt "Brad Pitt"), [Cate Blanchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Blanchett "Cate Blanchett"), [Adriana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriana_Barraza "Adriana Barraza"), Gael Garcia Bernal, [Rinko Kikuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinko_Kikuchi "Rinko Kikuchi") and [Kōji Yakusho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dji_Yakusho "Kōji Yakusho"). The rest of the cast comprised non-professional actors.[^30] The film competed at the [2006 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Cannes_Film_Festival "2006 Cannes Film Festival"), where Iñárritu received the [Best Director Award (Prix de la mise en scène)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Director_Award_\(Cannes_Film_Festival\) "Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)"),[^31] becoming the first Mexican-born director to win the award.[^32] *Babel* was a critical and box office success. It received seven nominations at the [79th Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/79th_Academy_Awards "79th Academy Awards"), including [Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "Academy Award for Best Picture") and [Best Director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "Academy Award for Best Director").[^21] [Gustavo Santaolalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Santaolalla "Gustavo Santaolalla"), the film's composer, won the [Academy Award for Best Original Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Academy Award for Best Original Score").[^33] The film won the [Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_%E2%80%93_Drama "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama") in 2007.[^34] Iñárritu became the first Mexican director to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Directing and the [Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America_Award_for_Outstanding_Directing_%E2%80%93_Feature_Film "Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film").[^35] [^36] After this third feature film collaboration with writing partner Arriaga, Iñárritu and he professionally parted ways, following Iñárritu's barring of Arriaga from the set during filming. Arriaga told the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")* in 2009, "It had to come to an end, but I still respect \[González Iñárritu\]." [^37]

Iñárritu at the Cannes Film Festival 2019

*The One Percent*, originally planned as an upcoming American television drama series created and written by Iñárritu, [Alexander Dinelaris Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dinelaris_Jr. "Alexander Dinelaris Jr."), [Nicolás Giacobone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Giacobone "Nicolás Giacobone") and [Armando Bó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_B%C3%B3_\(screenwriter\) "Armando Bó (screenwriter)"), was eventually postponed on early March 2017 due to Alejandro feeling burnt out after the production of *The Revenant*. The quartet, who also collaborated on *Birdman*, were to serve as executive producers. Iñárritu was set to direct the first two episodes and set the visual style of the show.[^66] Iñárritu's [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality") project *[Carne y Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_and_Sand "Flesh and Sand")* was the first ever VR installation presented at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") in 2017. Carne y Arena was also presented, at LACMA, Washington, D.C., and featured at the [Prada Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada_Foundation "Prada Foundation") in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan").[^67] [^68] Additionally, *Carne y Arena* was awarded the first [Special Achievement Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Achievement_Academy_Award "Special Achievement Academy Award") in over 20 years at the Academy's 9th Annual Governors Awards.[^69]

### 2020–present

Iñárritu co-wrote, co-produced and directed the 2022 Spanish-language film *[Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo,_False_Chronicle_of_a_Handful_of_Truths "Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths")*, starring [Daniel Giménez Cacho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gim%C3%A9nez_Cacho "Daniel Giménez Cacho") and [Griselda Siciliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griselda_Siciliani "Griselda Siciliani").

But for me, there's a kind of racist undercurrent where because I'm Mexican, I'm pretentious".[^74] It earned a nomination for the [Academy Award for Best Cinematography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography "Academy Award for Best Cinematography") at the [85th Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85th_Academy_Awards "85th Academy Awards").[^75]

In 2009, Iñárritu, along with several filmmakers and actors, signed a petition in support of director [Roman Polanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski "Roman Polanski"), who had been detained while traveling to a film festival following his arrest in relation to his 1977 [sexual abuse charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case "Roman Polanski sexual abuse case"), which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown "freely and safely", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door "for actions of which no-one can know the effects."
