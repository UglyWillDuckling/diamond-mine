 **A fundamental concept in database design!**

  A `foreign key` is a field in a table that refers to the **primary** key of
  another table. In other words, it is a field in a table that points to the
  primary key of another table. This allows you to create a relationship
  between them.

  Let's break it down:

  Table A (Primary Key):  id  (e.g.,  id  = 1, 2, 3...)

  Table B (Foreign Key):  user_id  (e.g.,  user_id  = 1, 2, 3...)

  In this example,  user_id  in Table B, is a foreign key that references the
  id  column in Table A. This means that the values in  user_id  in Table B
  must match the values in  id .

  Here's why foreign keys are useful:

  1. Relationships: They establish relationships between them, enabling you to
  link related data across tables.
  2. Data integrity: By enforcing referential integrity, foreign keys ensure
  that only valid relationships are created, preventing inconsistencies and
  errors.
  3. Improved data organization: Foreign keys help to normalize data, reducing
  redundancy and improving data organization.

  Let's consider an example:

  Table: Orders

    ORDERID │ CUSTOMERID
  ──────────┼─────────────
          1 │          1
          2 │          1
          3 │          2

  Table: Customers

    CUSTOMERID │ NAME
  ─────────────┼───────
             1 │ John
             2 │ Jane

  In this example, the  CustomerID  column in the  Orders  table is a foreign
  key that references the  CustomerID  column in the  Customers  table. This
  establishes a relationship between orders and customers, allowing you to
  easily retrieve the customer details for each order.

  In summary, foreign keys are essential for building robust, scalable, and
  maintainable databases by establishing relationships between tables and
  ensuring data consistency.
