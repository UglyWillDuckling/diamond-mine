Development of the film began before Barker's novella was published. Disappointed by previous adaptations of his work, Barker elected to direct himself, appropriating several actors and crew from his earlier career as a playwright. With the backing of independent producer [Christopher Figg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Figg "Christopher Figg") and financing from [New World Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Pictures "New World Pictures"), filming took place in London in autumn 1986.

*Hellraiser* had its first public showing at the [Prince Charles Cinema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles_Cinema "Prince Charles Cinema") on 10 September 1987. It was widely released in the United Kingdom by [Entertainment Film Distributors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Film_Distributors "Entertainment Film Distributors"), and was a considerable commercial success, grossing $30 million from its $1 million production budget. Critical reception was initially divided, but the film has since been evaluated as a classic of the horror genre.

The film was followed by [nine sequels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_\(franchise\)#Films "Hellraiser (franchise)"), the first seven of which featured Bradley reprising his role as [Pinhead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhead_\(Hellraiser\) "Pinhead (Hellraiser)"). A reboot, also titled [*Hellraiser*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_\(2022_film\) "Hellraiser (2022 film)") and executive produced by Barker, was released in 2022.
