**Antonio Lucio Vivaldi**[^5] (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian composer, [virtuoso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso "Virtuoso") violinist and [impresario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresario "Impresario") of [Baroque music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music "Baroque music").[^footnotetalbotporterknapp2022%c2%a7_%22introduction%22-6] Along with [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach "Johann Sebastian Bach") and [George Frideric Handel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel "George Frideric Handel"), Vivaldi ranks amongst the greatest [Baroque composers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_composers "Baroque composers") and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in [orchestration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration "Orchestration"), violin technique and [programmatic music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_music "Program music").[^footnotetalbotlockey2020-7] He consolidated the emerging [concerto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto "Concerto") form into a widely accepted and followed idiom.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental [concertos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto "Concerto"), for the [violin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin "Violin") and a variety of other [musical instruments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument "Musical instrument"), as well as [sacred choral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Music "Sacred Music") works and more than [fifty operas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operas_by_Antonio_Vivaldi "List of operas by Antonio Vivaldi"). His best-known work is a series of [violin concertos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_concerto "Violin concerto") known as *[The Four Seasons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_\(Vivaldi\) "The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)")*. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the *[Ospedale della Pietà](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ospedale_della_Piet%C3%A0 "Ospedale della Pietà")*, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi began studying for the priesthood at the age of 15 and was ordained at 25, but was given dispensation to no longer say public Masses due to a health problem.[^8] Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in [Venice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"), [Mantua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua "Mantua") and [Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"). After meeting the [Emperor Charles VI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VI,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor"), Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered – some as recently as 2015.[^9] His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.
