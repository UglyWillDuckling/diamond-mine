**Johann Baptist Strauss II** (German: [\[ˈjoːhan bapˈtɪst ˈʃtʁaʊs\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German"); 25 October 1825 – 3 June 1899), also known as **Johann Strauss Jr.**, **the Younger** or **the Son** (German: *Johann Strauß Sohn*), was an [Austrian composer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Austrian_composers "List of Austrian composers") of [light music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_music "Light music"), particularly [dance music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music "Dance music") and [operettas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operetta "Operetta") as well as a violinist. He composed over 500 [waltzes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz "Waltz"), [polkas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polka "Polka"), [quadrilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrille "Quadrille"), and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include "[The Blue Danube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Danube "The Blue Danube")", "[Kaiser-Walzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser-Walzer "Kaiser-Walzer")" (Emperor Waltz), "[Tales from the Vienna Woods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Vienna_Woods "Tales from the Vienna Woods")", "[Frühlingsstimmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%BChlingsstimmen "Frühlingsstimmen")", and the "[Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka "Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka")". Among his operettas, *[Die Fledermaus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Fledermaus "Die Fledermaus")* and *[Der Zigeunerbaron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Zigeunerbaron "Der Zigeunerbaron")* are the best known.

Strauss was the son of [Johann Strauss I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strauss_I "Johann Strauss I") and his first wife Maria Anna Streim. Two younger brothers, [Josef](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Strauss "Josef Strauss") and [Eduard Strauss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Strauss "Eduard Strauss"), also became composers of light music, although they were never as well known as their brother.

Strauss often suffered from a variety of lifelong health problems, including [hypochondria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondria "Hypochondria"), several [phobias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobias "Phobias"), and [bronchial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchial "Bronchial") [catarrh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catarrh "Catarrh"). In late May of 1899, he developed a respiratory illness which developed into [pleuropneumonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleuropneumonia "Pleuropneumonia"), and on 3 June 1899 he died in Vienna, at the age of 73. He was buried in the [Zentralfriedhof](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zentralfriedhof "Zentralfriedhof"). At the time of his death, he was still composing his ballet *Aschenbrödel*.[^footnotejacob1940341-28]

As a result of the efforts by [Clemens Krauss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemens_Krauss "Clemens Krauss"), who performed a special all-Strauss programme in 1929 with the [Vienna Philharmonic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Philharmonic "Vienna Philharmonic"), Strauss's music is now regularly performed at the annual [Vienna New Year's Concert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_New_Year%27s_Concert "Vienna New Year's Concert"). Distinguished Strauss interpreters include [Willi Boskovsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_Boskovsky "Willi Boskovsky"),[^29] who carried on the **Vorgeiger** tradition of conducting with violin in hand, as was the Strauss family custom, as well as [Herbert von Karajan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_von_Karajan "Herbert von Karajan"), [Carlos Kleiber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Kleiber "Carlos Kleiber"), [Lorin Maazel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorin_Maazel "Lorin Maazel"), [Zubin Mehta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubin_Mehta "Zubin Mehta") and [Riccardo Muti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Muti "Riccardo Muti"). In addition, the [Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Johann_Strauss_Orchester "Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester"), which was formed in 1966, pays tribute to the touring orchestras which once made the Strauss family so famous.[^30] In 1987 Dutch violinist and conductor [André Rieu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Rieu "André Rieu") also created a [Johann Strauss Orchestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strauss_Orchestra "Johann Strauss Orchestra").

Eduard Strauss surprisingly wound up the Strauss Orchestra on 13 February 1901 after concerts in 840 cities around the globe, and pawned the instruments. The orchestra's last violins were destroyed in the firestorm of the Second World War.[^footnoteweitlaner2019118-31]

Most of the Strauss works that are performed today may once have existed in a slightly different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's [Mariahilf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariahilf "Mariahilf") district in 1907.[^footnotejacob1940363-32] Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, [Carl Michael Ziehrer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Michael_Ziehrer "Carl Michael Ziehrer").[^33]

Two museums in Vienna are dedicated to Johann Strauss II. His [residence in the Praterstrasse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Museum#Johann_Strauss_residence "Vienna Museum"), where he lived in the 1860s, is now part of the [Vienna Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Museum "Vienna Museum"). The [Strauss Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss_Museum "Strauss Museum") is about the whole family, with a focus on Johann Strauss II.

The lives of the Strauss dynasty members are the subject of several film and television features, such as *[The Great Waltz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Waltz_\(1938_film\) "The Great Waltz (1938 film)")* (1938), remade [in 1972](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Waltz_\(1972_film\) "The Great Waltz (1972 film)"); *[The Strauss Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strauss_Family "The Strauss Family")* (1972); *The Strauss Dynasty* (1991) and *Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time* (1995). Many other films used his works and melodies. [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock "Alfred Hitchcock") made a biographical film of Strauss in 1934 called *[Waltzes from Vienna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltzes_from_Vienna "Waltzes from Vienna")*.

After a trip to Vienna, [Walt Disney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney "Walt Disney") was inspired to create four feature films. One of those was *The Waltz King*, a loosely adapted biopic of Strauss, which aired as part of *[The Wonderful World of Disney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_World_of_Disney "The Wonderful World of Disney")* in the U.S. in 1963.[^34]
