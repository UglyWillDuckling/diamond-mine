***Andor***, also known as ***Star Wars: Andor*** and ***Andor: A Star Wars Story*** for its second season, is an American [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television "Science fiction on television") television series created by [Tony Gilroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gilroy "Tony Gilroy") for the streaming service [Disney+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B "Disney+"). It is part of the *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars")* franchise and a [prequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel "Prequel") to the film *[Rogue One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One "Rogue One")* (2016), which in turn is a prequel to the [original *Star Wars* film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_\(film\) "Star Wars (film)") (1977). The series follows thief-turned-rebel spy [Cassian Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassian_Andor "Cassian Andor") during the five years that lead to the events of the two films, exploring how he becomes radicalized against the [Galactic Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_\(Star_Wars\) "Galactic Empire (Star Wars)") and how the wider [Rebel Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Alliance "Rebel Alliance") is formed.

[Diego Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Luna "Diego Luna") reprises his role as Cassian Andor from *Rogue One* and serves as an executive producer. The series also stars [Kyle Soller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Soller "Kyle Soller"), [Adria Arjona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adria_Arjona "Adria Arjona"), [Stellan Skarsgård](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellan_Skarsg%C3%A5rd "Stellan Skarsgård"), [Fiona Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Shaw "Fiona Shaw"), [Genevieve O'Reilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevieve_O%27Reilly "Genevieve O'Reilly"), [Denise Gough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Gough "Denise Gough"), [Faye Marsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Marsay "Faye Marsay"), [Varada Sethu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varada_Sethu "Varada Sethu"), and Elizabeth Dulau. [Lucasfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm "Lucasfilm") announced a series focused on Andor in November 2018, with Luna attached and [Stephen Schiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Schiff "Stephen Schiff") hired as [showrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner"). Schiff was replaced by *Rogue One* co-writer Gilroy as creator and showrunner in April 2020. Filming took place at [Pinewood Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_Studios "Pinewood Studios") in London and on location around the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), with [Neal Scanlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Scanlan "Neal Scanlan") returning from *Rogue One* to provide practical effects. The first season, which tells a year of Andor's story when he first becomes a revolutionary, was filmed from November 2020 to September 2021 during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"). The second season covers the next four years leading up to *Rogue One*, and was filmed from November 2022 to February 2024 with breaks and delays due to the [2023 Hollywood labor disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hollywood_labor_disputes "2023 Hollywood labor disputes"). [Nicholas Britell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Britell "Nicholas Britell") composed the series' original score.

*Andor* premiered on September 21, 2022, with the first three episodes of the first season. The other nine episodes of the season were released weekly through November 23. The first season received critical acclaim, and has been called the "most complex, mature story in *Star Wars*",[^npr-3] as well as several accolades. It was nominated for three [Primetime Emmy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards "75th Primetime Emmy Awards") including [Outstanding Drama Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Drama_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series"). The second and final season is scheduled to premiere on April 22, 2025, with three episodes releasing weekly until May 13.

However, his deputy, the dutiful Syril Karn, is determined to solve the case. He identifies Cassian's ship, traces it to Ferrix and learns that the fugitive is from the planet Kenari. In a flashback, a younger Cassian, known as Kassa, joins a group on Kenari who set off to locate a crashed ship.

## Production

### Development

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Tony_Gilroy_%287732161230%29.jpg/170px-Tony_Gilroy_%287732161230%29.jpg)

[Tony Gilroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gilroy "Tony Gilroy") joined the series after working on the *Star Wars* film *[Rogue One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One "Rogue One")*, and took over development after sharing his vision with the studio

[Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney "Disney") CEO [Bob Iger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger "Bob Iger") announced in November 2017 that Disney and [Lucasfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm "Lucasfilm") were developing live-action *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars")* television series for the new streaming service [Disney+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B "Disney+").[^disney+seriesnov2017-26][^disney+seriesfeb2018-27] One of these series was revealed a year later to be a prequel to the film *[Rogue One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One "Rogue One")* (2016). The series was described as a [spy thriller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_thriller "Spy thriller") show focused on the character [Cassian Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassian_Andor "Cassian Andor"), with [Diego Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Luna "Diego Luna") reprising his role from the film. Production was expected to begin in 2019 after Luna completed filming the second season of *[Narcos: Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos:_Mexico "Narcos: Mexico")*.[^seriesorder-28] [Jared Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bush "Jared Bush") originally developed the series, writing a pilot script and [series bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_\(screenwriting\) "Bible (screenwriting)") for the project.[^schiff-29]

By the end of November 2018, [Stephen Schiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Schiff "Stephen Schiff") was serving as [showrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner") and executive producer of the series.[^schiff-29] [Tony Gilroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gilroy "Tony Gilroy"), who was credited as a co-writer on *Rogue One* and oversaw extensive reshoots for the film,[^gilroy-30] joined the series by early 2019 when he discussed the first story details with Luna.[^vanityfairmay2022-4] Gilroy had received an earlier version of the script, who compared Andor's relationship with [K-2SO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-2SO "K-2SO") to that of [Butch Cassidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy "Butch Cassidy") and the [Sundance Kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Kid "Sundance Kid"), and felt it was "totally limited and claustrophobic". As such, he had sent a letter to Lucasfilm president [Kathleen Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_\(producer\) "Kathleen Kennedy (producer)") explaining his vision for the series. By the next year, Kennedy had contacted Gilroy to ask if he was interested in joining the series.[^deadlineinterview-31] In July 2019, [Rick Famuyiwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Famuyiwa "Rick Famuyiwa") was in early talks to direct several episodes after doing the same for the first live-action *Star Wars* series, *[The Mandalorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian "The Mandalorian")*.[^famuyiwa-32] Gilroy's involvement was revealed that October, when he was set to write the first episode, direct multiple episodes, and work alongside Schiff;[^gilroy-30] Gilroy had officially replaced Schiff as showrunner by April 2020.[^o'reillygough-7] Six weeks of pre-production for the series had taken place in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") by then, but this was halted and production on the series delayed due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic").[^preprodapr2020-33][^o'reillygough2-34] Pre-production had begun again by September ahead of a planned filming start the next month. At that time, Gilroy, who is based in New York, chose not to travel to the UK for production on the series due to the pandemic, and was therefore unable to direct the series' first episode. Instead, the UK-based [Toby Haynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Haynes "Toby Haynes"), who was already "high on the list" of potential directors for the series, was hired to direct the first three episodes. Gilroy would remain executive producer and showrunner.[^haynes-35] Kennedy announced the series' title, *Andor*, in December 2020, along with its 2022 release date. Luna was revealed to be executive producing the series, which was set to consist of 12 episodes.[^titleannouncement-36][^announcementvideo-37] In February 2021, [Ben Caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Caron "Ben Caron") and [Susanna White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_White "Susanna White") were set as additional directors.[^caronwhite-39] Sanne Wohlenberg and [Michelle Rejwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Rejwan "Michelle Rejwan") also executive produce.

In February 2022, star [Stellan Skarsgård](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellan_Skarsg%C3%A5rd "Stellan Skarsgård") indicated that the series would have a second season, with filming for it beginning in late 2022.[^skarsgards2-40] That April, cinematographer [Adriano Goldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriano_Goldman "Adriano Goldman") said there had originally been plans for the series to last five seasons, but he believed those had changed and it was now expected to last three.[^goldman-41] At [*Star Wars* Celebration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Celebration "Star Wars Celebration") a month later, Lucasfilm confirmed a 12-episode second season.[^deadlinehollywoodtrailer-42] Gilroy explained that the original five-season plan was deemed to be "physically impossible" due to the series' scale, and instead they realized that they could end the series with one more season that led directly into the events of *Rogue One*.[^deadlinehollywoodtrailer-42][^gilroy5seasons-43][^starwarscelebration-44]

Documentation submitted by E&E Industries (UK), the subsidiary responsible for Andor, shows a total of $344.6 million spent by November 2022. This includes the costs of season 1 (£270.8/$271.6 million to November 2021), as well as subsequent season 1 costs and pre-production on season 2, likely mostly the latter (£67.9/$80.2 million). With a £54.6}/$70.9 reimbursement, net costs to November 2022 reduced to approximately $273.7 million. 3782 crew were used on season 1 as of April 5, 2021. Season 2 had a reduced 1067 crew as of April 5, 2023.[^forbesbudget2024-45]

### Writing

In addition to Gilroy and Schiff, writers for the series include [Beau Willimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Willimon "Beau Willimon") and Gilroy's brother [Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilroy "Dan Gilroy").[^o'reillygough-7][^wgacredits-46] Gilroy urged his writing team to put aside their personal reverence and nostalgia for *Star Wars*, fearing that such an attitude could change their behavior and work.[^gilroythrsep2022-47] Gilroy wanted the series to be accessible to all viewers, not just *Star Wars* fans, with the hope that those fans would be able to watch the series with their friends and family who are not interested in the rest of the franchise.[^vanityfairmay2022andor-5] He had also wanted to ensure the series was grounded in reality and had identified the main "navigational *Star Wars* piece of information" as being the calendar. During the first [writers' room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers%27_room "Writers' room") meeting, Gilroy had prepared a 100-page outline for the series, as he had already planned the structure of the series. Willimon and Dan Gilroy were present, in addition to executive producer Sanne Wohlenberg and production designer Luke Hull, calling Hull his "primary creative collaborator on the story". They had discussed the story for five days.[^deadlineinterview-31] Luna expressed his excitement at being able to explore the character of Andor further in the series after making *Rogue One*, in which the character also appears.[^announcementvideo-37]

Since *Andor* is a prequel to the film, Luna said it was "nice to go into a story \[of which\] you already know the ending. Now you can \[flesh out\] the nuances and the layers. I think it's fun to do something that isn't just about getting to the end. It's about delaying that."[^lunafilmingstart-48] Luna was able to suggest elements of the character's backstory that he had thought of during the filming of *Rogue One*,[^vanityfairmay2022andor-5] and was grateful that Gilroy made the character a refugee.[^vanityfairmay2022-4] He explained, "It's the journey of a migrant, which to me is everything I come from. That feeling of *having to move* is behind this story very profoundly".[^vanityfairmay2022andor-5] Luna felt that because of this, it was "difficult to find out where he comes from", and felt that Andor wanted to "find the opportunities, the freedom, the chances they don't find where they're born".[^dogexclusivejuly2022-49] He had also felt that Andor's character was important to members of the [Hispanic and Latin American community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans "Hispanic and Latino Americans"), and wanted the "energy" of [Mexico–United States relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_relations "Mexico–United States relations") to be represented in Andor's journey.[^andorheritage-50] Gilroy wanted to expand upon Andor's backstory, and had used a dialogue said by him in *Rogue One*, "I've been in this fight since I was six years old!", as a starting point. In the development process, Gilroy had labelled it "The Education of Cassian Andor". From there, he had created the planet Kenari as his childhood home, where he had lived with other children and no adult supervision. Gilroy had compared it to being a "*[Lord of the Flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies "Lord of the Flies")*\-like tribe", with Andor's separation from the tribe also serving as an introduction to Maarva and Clem Andor, desiring to introduce the audience to the Ferrix culture early on as the writing team had spent time creating its social structure. Towards the beginning, he had described Maarva as loving Andor "as much as she could possibly love him", though in the beginning of the series, she had been disappointed by the direction of Andor's life. As the series had progressed, Gilroy wanted to develop the emotional connection between them.[^andoreducation-51]

The first season begins five years before *[Rogue One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One "Rogue One")* and tells one year of Andor's story when he first becomes a revolutionary. The next four years are then covered by the second season, which leads directly into the events of the film.[^starwarscelebration-44][^vanityfairmay2022andor-5] Gilroy approached the two seasons as two-halves of a novel and described the show beginning as "a very simple, almost [film noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir") situation for a thief \[Andor\]. A skeevy kind of guy gets in big trouble, tries to sell something he has to save his ass".[^vanityfairmay2022andor-5] Luna said the series was about the building of a revolution,[^announcementvideo-37] and said it was important to explore "the revolutionary we can become to change things, to stop war, to make this world a livable place" which he felt was relevant to real-world issues.[^vanityfairmay2022andor-5] Gilroy stated, "This guy gave his life for the galaxy, right? I mean, he consciously, soberly, without vanity or recognition, sacrificed himself. Who does that?" He wanted to explore that idea in the first season, beginning with Andor "being really revolution-averse, and cynical, and lost, and kind of a mess". The season shows the destruction of Andor's homeworld when he was a boy and is then based on Andor's adopted planet, which becomes radicalized against the [Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_\(Star_Wars\) "Galactic Empire (Star Wars)").[^vanityfairmay2022-4]

Luna and Gilroy said the series was also about "how the disenfranchised can stand up to effect change".[^dogexclusivejuly2022-49] Gilroy had not intentionally written the show to create political commentary and rejected the notion of being influenced by contemporary events, but said that it had come "instinctively", as his primary priority was characterization and serving the story. The writing team had used history as a "catalog" for the story with Gilroy further explaining that people can interpret the characters however they wish, but the main intention was for the audience to connect to them.[^indiewiregilroy-52] Co-star [Fiona Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Shaw "Fiona Shaw") described Gilroy's political commentary in the scripts as a "great, scurrilous \[take\] on the [Trumpian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump "First presidency of Donald Trump") world", adding that "our world is exploding in different places right now, people's rights are disappearing, and *Andor* reflects that. \[In the show\] the Empire is taking over, and it feels like the same thing is happening in reality, too".[^empiretrumpcomparison-53] Meanwhile, Gough has stated that her character arc in the series deals with [gender politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics "Identity politics"), while Gilroy explained that "We have a very, very, very deep dive into the Imperial side of the story".[^tfgough-12] Gilroy had written Meero's character with the intention of making her character relatable to the audience as she had been putting genuine effort into doing her job and "fighting her way up in a [male environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy "Patriarchy")".[^andoreducation-51] After starting with Andor's story in the first three episodes, the fourth begins to expand the scope of the series to include the rest of its large [ensemble cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast "Ensemble cast"), such as Rebel leader [Mon Mothma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_Mothma "Mon Mothma"), whose path will cross with Andor's in the second season. Gilroy felt *Star Wars* fans would see Mothma in a new light after watching the series, and added that there were key characters and events in the series that would be different or "more interesting" than fans previously realized: "What you've been told, what's on [Wookieepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookieepedia "Wookieepedia")... is really all wrong".[^vanityfairmay2022andor-5]

Tony Gilroy, Dan Gilroy, and Beau Willimon returned to write for the second season, and were joined by [Tom Bissell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bissell "Tom Bissell").[^s2writers-54][^wgacredits-46] The final three episodes of the second season will cover the three days prior to the start of *Rogue One*, with Gilroy saying "it'll be, like, four or five days, and then we'll jump a year, and then there'll be another four or five days, and then we jump a year", with the final shot leading into *Rogue One*.[^finalthreedays-55][^deadlineinterview-31]

### Design

Luke Hull served as production designer on the series,[^hull-56] and described it as "very cinematic".[^announcementvideo-37] [Neal Scanlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Scanlan "Neal Scanlan") provided the creature and droid effects after doing the same for all of Disney's *Star Wars* films, including *Rogue One*.[^scanlanfs-57] He said his team was treating the series the same as they did the films,[^announcementvideo-37] and due to Gilroy's involvement the series would fit within the same "pocket of \[*Star Wars*\] history" as *Rogue One* with a "slightly harder edge" than other *Star Wars* projects.[^scanlanfs-57] Scanlan added that unused creatures developed for the films could be brought back for the series,[^scanlanmw-58] alongside newly created creatures.[^announcementvideo-37] An outdoor city set, which co-star Adria Arjona estimated to be three to five city blocks long, was built practically for the series.[^colliderarjona-59]

O'Reilly reprises her role of Mon Mothma from *Rogue One* and other *Star Wars* media.[^skarsgardsoller-61][^o'reillygough-7] [Adria Arjona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adria_Arjona "Adria Arjona") joined the cast in August 2020,[^arjona-62] and [Fiona Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Shaw "Fiona Shaw") was revealed to also be appearing in December,[^titleannouncement-36] when Tudyk was not included in an official cast list. A month later, Tudyk confirmed that he would no longer be appearing in the first season due to Gilroy's story changes but he could appear in potential future seasons.[^tudykjan2021-63] [Robert Emms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Emms "Robert Emms") was cast in a supporting role in June 2021,[^emms-18] when Skarsgård revealed that [Forest Whitaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker "Forest Whitaker") was reprising his role as [Saw Gerrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_Gerrera "Saw Gerrera") from *Rogue One*.[^whitaker-16] In February 2022, [David Hayman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hayman "David Hayman") confirmed that he had a role in the series after being spotted by fans during filming.[^hayman-19] The first season has over 200 named cast members and over 6,000 extras.[^announcementvideo-37]

Luna, Skarsgård, O'Reilly, Soller, Arjona, Gough, Marsay, Sethu, Dulau, McArdle, and Bhaier reprise their roles in the second season.[^s2writers-54] In March 2023, set footage revealed that [Benjamin Bratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bratt "Benjamin Bratt") had been cast for the second season in an undisclosed role.[^laspro-22][^hostel-23] In June 2024, [Ben Mendelsohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Mendelsohn "Ben Mendelsohn") was revealed to be reprising his role as [Orson Krennic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Krennic "Orson Krennic") from *Rogue One* in the second season.[^ruizpalaciosmendelsohn-20] Tudyk appears in the second season.[^tudykd23trailer-21]

### Filming

Filming began in London, England, at the end of November 2020,[^lunafilmingstart-48][^titleannouncementverge-64] with the production based at [Pinewood Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_Studios "Pinewood Studios").[^cleveleysfilming-65][^pinewoodfilming-66] The series was filmed under the [working title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title "Working title") *Pilgrim*,[^cleveleysfilming-65] and was the first live-action *Star Wars* series to not make use of the [StageCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StageCraft "StageCraft") digital background technology. This was done because the scripts were more suited to being filmed on locations and large sets, and Luna noted that taking a different filming approach for the series made it similar to *Rogue One*, whose filming style was distinct from other *Star Wars* films.[^nostagecraft-67] Toby Haynes directed the first three episodes,[^haynes-35] with [Ben Caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Caron "Ben Caron"), [Susanna White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_White "Susanna White"), and Haynes each directing another "block" of three episodes.[^gilroyempires2timeline-9][^caronwhite-39] [Jonathan Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Freeman_\(cinematographer\) "Jonathan Freeman (cinematographer)") and Adriano Goldman served as cinematographers.[^goldman-41][^freeman-68] The series was previously reported to begin filming in 2019,[^seriesorder-28] and then June 2020,[^freeman-68] but was delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[^o'reillygough2-34] Both UK and U.S. COVID-19 protocols were followed on set, including daily temperature checks and tests for COVID-19 three times a week.[^pinewoodfilming-66] Filming at Pinewood Studios was expected to end in July 2021.[^pinewoodfilming-66]

## Music

Main article: [*Andor* (soundtrack)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_\(soundtrack\) "Andor (soundtrack)")

Gilroy contacted [Nicholas Britell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Britell "Nicholas Britell") about composing for the series in 2020, before filming began so he could compose [source music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_music "Source music") that would be played on set. Gilroy and Britell, who are neighbors in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan"), first met for the project in August 2020. Kennedy and Gilroy wanted the series to have a unique sound, and Britell said it would be "orchestral-plus" with a "wide range of sounds" including some that he had created. He added that the large scope of the series meant that "every episode has new demands, new music, and new ideas. It's important that as the story evolves, the music should evolve too."[^britellvarietymay2022-91] Britell was publicly revealed to be the series' composer in February 2022,[^britell-92] and was still working on it that May when he said they had been "working nonstop for months, actually years, at this point". Recording was underway by then at [AIR Lyndhurst studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Independent_Recording "Associated Independent Recording") in London, with a full orchestra. Britell was unable to travel to London due to the pandemic, but had a team in place there that also worked with him on other television series.[^britellvarietymay2022-91]

## Marketing

A [sizzle reel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizzle_reel "Sizzle reel") featuring behind-the-scenes footage of pre-production and filming was released during Disney's Investors Day presentation in December 2020, when the series' title and cast was officially announced by Kennedy.[^titleannouncement-36][^announcementvideo-37] Gilroy, Luna, and O'Reilly promoted the series at [*Star Wars* Celebration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Celebration "Star Wars Celebration") in May 2022, where they revealed the first [teaser trailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaser_trailer "Teaser trailer").[^starwarscelebration-44][^deadlinehollywoodtrailer-42] *[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter "The Hollywood Reporter")*'s Aaron Couch said it showed the "gritty side" of the *Star Wars* universe.[^thrtrailer-93] Daniel Chin of *[The Ringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ringer_\(website\) "The Ringer (website)")* felt the series had a unique identity in the *Star Wars* franchise, with a darker tone, and said the teaser "paints a picture of the formative years of the rebellion against the Empire".[^theringertrailer-94] Ryan Scott from *[/Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//Film "/Film")* felt the teaser gave the "most comprehensive view at the show up to this point". He said the series could explore the morality behind the Rebels, writing that while they are usually seen as heroes there is also "much gray area in there to be explored". Writing for *[CNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET "CNET")*, Sean Keane felt the trailer did not give much away but gave an "intriguing taste of the show's [espionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage "Espionage") tone".[^cnettrailer-96]

Luna promoted the series and debuted the official trailer on *[Good Morning America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America "Good Morning America")* on August 1.[^trailer2-97] Hattie Lindert from *[The A.V.

[*Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)") attributed this to factors such as "franchise fatigue," insufficient fan service, competition from other fantasy and sci-fi shows, and the "lackluster [*Obi-Wan Kenobi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_\(miniseries\) "Obi-Wan Kenobi (miniseries)")" miniseries.[^133] *[MovieWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MovieWeb "MovieWeb")* noted that despite some initial reports suggesting lower demand, *Andor* still managed to perform well, with audience demand significantly higher than average streaming shows.[^134] Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, reported that *Andor*'s audience demand was 34.1 times higher than that of the average TV show, with *The Mandalorian* close behind at 34 times the average demand, from October 15–21, 2022.[^135][^136] Parrot Analytics later announced that *Andor* was the most in-demand United States breakout television series, referring to shows that have premiered in the past 100 days, from November 12–18, 2022. It had 37.7 times the average demand of all other series in the United States.[^137][^138] Streaming analytics firm FlixPatrol, which monitors daily updated VOD charts and streaming ratings across the globe, reported that *Andor* was the ninth most-streamed series on Disney+ in 2022.[^139] According to the file-sharing news website *[TorrentFreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TorrentFreak "TorrentFreak")*, *Andor* was the tenth most-watched pirated television series of 2022.[^140][^141]

### Critical response

The [review aggregator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator "Review aggregator") website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes") reported an approval rating of 96% with an average rating of 8.55/10 based on 609 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, "A gritty adventure told from the ground perspective of the Empire's reign, *Andor* is an exceptionally mature and political entry into the *Star Wars* mythos – and one of the best yet."[^rt-142] [Metacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), which uses a [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean "Weighted arithmetic mean"), assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[^mc-143]

*Andor* was considered one of the best TV series of 2022, and was praised for its differences from other *Star Wars* shows.[^bestof22cluster1-144] [NPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR")'s Mandalit del Barco summarized that *Andor* was "being hailed as the most complex, mature story in *Star Wars* lore".[^npr-3] In a four star review, Jack Seale of *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* called *Andor* "the best *Star Wars* show since *[The Mandalorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian "The Mandalorian")*".[^guardianreview-145] Caroline Framke of *[Variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* was positive towards *Andor*'s departure from other *Star Wars* projects with a "story of people who have nothing to do with Solos, Skywalkers or Palpatines, but whose lives matter nonetheless".[^varietyreview-146] Similarly, [Nicholas Quah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Quah "Nicholas Quah") of the [*Vulture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_\(website\) "Vulture (website)") called the show "a breath of fresh air" and praised the "utter confidence of its storytelling", "richness of its political ideas", [score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_\(soundtrack\) "Andor (soundtrack)"), production design and dialogue.[^147]

Simon Cardy of *[IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN")* praised the characters and character development, calling it "one of the very best things ever to come out of the *Star Wars* universe" in a 9 out of 10 review.[^ign-148] The characterizations were criticized by Mike Hale of *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")*, who considered them thin and unfulfilling.[^149]

### Accolades

*Andor* was critically acclaimed and consistently ranked first in the top ten on numerous publications' "Best of 2022" lists for television series, including that of *[IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN")*, *[Polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_\(website\) "Polygon (website)")*, *[USA Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today "USA Today")*, *[Vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_\(magazine\) "Vulture (magazine)")*, and *[Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_\(magazine\) "Empire (magazine)")*, among others.[^bestof22cluster1-144][^bestof22cluster2-150] Numerous publications also considered *Andor* the best *Star Wars* TV show, including *[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")*, *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* and *Vulture*.[^151][^152][^153]
