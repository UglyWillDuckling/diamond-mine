## notes ðŸ“”
- ovaj tip zvuci ko `majmun`
- kako je cudan #weird  
- & raspolozenje u firmi je je dosta nisko â†˜
- ! **bonuses are only given to full time employees**
- ovaj pristup je prepun **konflikata** - s jedne strane se zele zadrzat ljudi a s druge se hoce zadrzat fleksibilnost
- ovo sve zvuci kao prijetnja

## important
- ! if people ...
- _the money is note there_

- When [[Axel Springer]] increased the its share in [[AVIV]] it came with expectations
	- ! if [[HOC]] becomes too expensive there is no interest in working with **us**
- [[Maarten Van der Most]] 2025 will be a sobering year

	- ? how can you grow if you're `reducing costs`?

## discussion
- [!] Who should we address about payment raise?
- [?] Annualy review process
	- @ [[Maarten Van der Most]] will be fair
	- ==fair, transparent for everyone==
	- adjustment of **compensation** #salary
- [?] Who will we discuss our hourly rate and pay rise with in relation to the B2B contract moving forward?
- [?] a lot of teams did never meet in person, is that going to be possible, it would be great to meet the people working with
	- @ you might be asked to travel to meet your colleagues in France or Germany
	- @ traveling inside Croatia also be possible
- [?] What are the primary reasons for HoC to decide to hire **B2B** vs Direct? Is it possible to transition from one to the other?  (edited)  
	- [x] [[Maarten Van der Most]] the main reason why[[AVIV]] is using us is because of **Flexibility** #dark
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they don't want fulltime employees</mark>
		- *weird comparison with cloud infrastructure*
- [?] The mood is overall down, what plans are in place to address that?
	- [x] [[Maarten Van der Most]] - mood is `key` #weird #conflict
