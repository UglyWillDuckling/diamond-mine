***The Earthsea Cycle***, also known as ***Earthsea***, is a series of [high fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy "High fantasy") books written by American author [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin "Ursula K. Le Guin"). Beginning with *[A Wizard of Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wizard_of_Earthsea "A Wizard of Earthsea")* (1968), *[The Tombs of Atuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tombs_of_Atuan "The Tombs of Atuan")*, (1970) and *[The Farthest Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farthest_Shore "The Farthest Shore")* (1972), the series was continued in *[Tehanu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehanu "Tehanu")* (1990), and *[Tales from Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_Earthsea "Tales from Earthsea")* and *[The Other Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Wind "The Other Wind")* (both 2001). In 2018, all the novels and short stories were published in a single volume, *The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition*, with artwork by [Charles Vess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Vess "Charles Vess").

## Setting

### Geography

![[~/×/aeded96435ac6027df16c91aeff61bca_MD5.png|200]]

Map of Earthsea

The [world of Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea_\(universe\) "Earthsea (universe)") is one of sea and islands: a vast archipelago of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean. Earthsea contains no large continents. The largest island, Havnor, at approximately 380 miles (610 km) across, is about the size of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain"). The cultures of Earthsea are literate non-industrial civilizations and not direct analogues of the real world. The overall climate of Earthsea is temperate, comparable to the mid-latitudes (over a distance of about 1,800 miles or 2,900 kilometres) of the northern hemisphere of the Earth. There is a yearly transition from warm summers to cold and snowy winters, especially on northern islands like Gont and Osskil. In the southern regions of Earthsea, it can be much warmer.

Most of the people of Earthsea have brown skin.[^2] In the Archipelago, "red-brown" skin is typical; however, the people of the East Reach have darker "black-brown" complexions.[^3] The people of Osskil in the north are described as having lighter, sallow complexions,[^4] while the [Kargs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karg "Karg") of the Kargad Lands are "white-skinned" and often "yellow-haired".[^5] 
Le Guin has **criticized** what she described as the general assumption in fantasy that characters should be white and the society should resemble the European [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages").[^6] 
Richard Erlich writes that Earthsea is "Earth in a legendary time", not some other planet. Having power centralized under a king could, Erlich writes, be the "least bad political option". He places the era as something like the [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") for Gont at the start of *A Wizard of Earthsea*, and the later period of rule by kings, started by Lebannen, as resembling [Mycenaean Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece "Mycenaean Greece") as mentioned by [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer").[^7]

### Cosmology

Magic is a central part of life in most of Earthsea; the exception being the Kargish lands, where it is forbidden. There are weather workers on ships, fixers who repair boats and buildings, entertainers, and court sorcerers. Magic is an inborn talent which can be refined with training. The most gifted are sent to the school on [[Roke]], where, if their skill and discipline prove sufficient, they can become staff-carrying wizards.

The Dry Land is where most people go after they die, with the exception of the Kargs. It is a realm of shadow and dust, of eternal night where the stars are fixed in the sky, and nothing changes. The souls who reside there have an empty, dreary existence, and even "lovers pass each other in silence". Le Guin stated that the idea of the Dry Land came from the "Greco-Roman idea of [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades "Hades") ' [realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_underworld "Greek underworld"), from certain images in [Dante Alighieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri") 's work, and from one of [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke "Rainer Maria Rilke") 's *[\[Duino\] Elegies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duino_Elegies "Duino Elegies")* ".[^8] In the fifth and last novel of the series, *[The Other Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Wind "The Other Wind")*, it is revealed that the Dry Land is a part of the dragons' domain that was stolen from them by the earliest mages in an attempt gone awry to obtain immortality. The Dry Land is restored to the dragons at the end of *The Other Wind*.

### Daoist philosophy

![[~/×/cfacc8dff8cbfa67c9c1fa2aca9f6763_MD5.png|200]]
[[Yin-Yang symbol]] of balanced opposites. In Le Guin's words, "Light is the left hand of darkness; darkness is the right hand of light." [^48] [^49]

Erlich writes that the *Earthsea* books embody [Taoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism "Taoism") philosophy, with *Tehanu* counterbalancing the initial trilogy.[^11] In *Tehanu*, Ged returns to Gont, completing the cycle of his quest: Erlich comments that this movement back to his roots is Daoist.[^11] The balancing of "polarities" such as light and dark, male and female, **doing and being** is central to the philosophy and to the novels. The [Yin-Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin-Yang "Yin-Yang") symbol reflects this, and Erlich analyses multiple occurrences of Yin-Yang in the series, commenting that "Yin-Yang, indeed, is a unifying symbol in the trilogy".[^11]

Erlich writes that the three books of the initial trilogy each embody a Taoist **balance** that needs restoring, a needed integration, and a doorway that must be closed.[^12]o

%% balance is mentioned multiple times directly in the novels %%

Le Guin originally intended for *[A Wizard of Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wizard_of_Earthsea "A Wizard of Earthsea")* to be a standalone novel, but she wrote *[The Tombs of Atuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tombs_of_Atuan "The Tombs of Atuan")* as a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book; *[The Farthest Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farthest_Shore "The Farthest Shore")* followed after further consideration. These three books were written in quick succession, from 1968 to 1972, and are sometimes seen as the "original trilogy".[^14] [^15] Nearly twenty years later, Le Guin wrote a fourth book, *[Tehanu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehanu "Tehanu")* (1990), and followed it with *[Tales from Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_Earthsea "Tales from Earthsea")* and *[The Other Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Wind "The Other Wind")* in 2001. The latter three books are sometimes referred to as the "second trilogy".[^15] [^16] The series as a whole is known as the *Earthsea Cycle*, and was published in a single volume in 2018 as *The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition*, with art by Charles Vess.[^17]

### Short stories

Le Guin published nine short stories of Earthsea. Seven appear in two collections of her work (and some have been reissued elsewhere). Two early stories were originally published in 1964, and were collected in *[The Wind's Twelve Quarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind%27s_Twelve_Quarters "The Wind's Twelve Quarters")* ([Harper & Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row "Harper & Row"), 1975). These helped to define the setting of Earthsea. Five much later stories were collected in *[Tales from Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_Earthsea "Tales from Earthsea")* (Harcourt, 2001), where three were original.[^18] In October 2014, a new novella set in Earthsea was published as a stand-alone, "The Daughter of Odren".[^19] [^20] A final 12-page short story, "Firelight", was published in June 2018, covering the last days of Ged.[^21]

*Tales from Earthsea* also includes about 30 pages of fictional reference material titled "A Description of Earthsea" (2001).[^18]

### Unsubmitted story

After "The Rule of Names" and before "A Wizard of Earthsea", Le Guin wrote a long story about a prince in search of the Ultimate. He travels south-west from Havnor through the archipelago into the open sea. There he finds a raft-colony and sea-people, whom he joins in the sea. The prince wears out, sinks and finds the Ultimate. This story was never submitted for publication because "it never worked out itself well".[^24] However, the theme of a raft-colony and sea-people was later taken up as an important ingredient in the plot of *[The Farthest Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farthest_Shore "The Farthest Shore")*.

## Awards

Each book in the series has received a literary award:

On November 5, 2019, the *[BBC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News "BBC News")* listed *The Earthsea Trilogy* on its list of the [100 most influential novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_list_of_100_%27most_inspiring%27_novels "BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels").[^28]

## Influences

The *Earthsea* series, from 1968, was one of the first fantasy series [influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_inspired_by_Tolkien "Works inspired by Tolkien").[^29] [^30] Among the Tolkienian archetypes in the Earthsea books are wizards (including the protagonist, [Ged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ged_\(Earthsea\) "Ged (Earthsea)")), a disinherited prince (Arren in *[The Farthest Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farthest_Shore "The Farthest Shore")*), a magical ring (the ring of Erreth-Akbe in *[The Tombs of Atuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tombs_of_Atuan "The Tombs of Atuan")*), a [Middle-earth style quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quests_in_Middle-earth "Quests in Middle-earth") (in *The Farthest Shore*), and powerful dragons (like the dragon of Pendor, in *A Wizard of Earthsea*).[^31]

The Tolkien scholar writes that Tolkien's name appears to be hidden in the small amount of the Hardic language of Earthsea in *The Wizard of Earthsea*. "Sea" is *sukien*, from *suk*, "foam", and *inien*, "feather". "Rock", the material of earth, is "tolk", so, he suggests, the Hardic for "Earthsea" would be *Tolkien*, for *tolk + inien* on the same pattern as *sukien*. Garth suggests that this is a tribute to Tolkien, *tolk* being the first word of the "Old Speech" that she names, and the first to be handed down both by the Wizard Ged to Tenar in *[The Tombs of Atuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tombs_of_Atuan "The Tombs of Atuan")*, and by Tenar to her daughter in *[Tehanu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehanu "Tehanu")*.[^32]

## Adaptations

### Audiobooks

Audiobook readings have been made by different narrators and publishers.[^33] In the early 1990s, [Robert Inglis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Inglis "Rob Inglis") narrated the first three books of the series for [Recorded Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_Books "Recorded Books").[^34]

### Radio

A [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") -produced two-hour radio dramatization of *A Wizard of Earthsea* was originally broadcast on [Radio 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4 "BBC Radio 4") on December 26, 1996. This adaptation was narrated by Dame [Judi Dench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judi_Dench "Judi Dench"), with [Michael Maloney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Maloney "Michael Maloney") as [Ged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ged_\(Earthsea\) "Ged (Earthsea)"), and used a wide range of actors with different regional and social accents to emphasize the origins of the Earthsea characters (for instance, Estarriol and others from the East Reach were played by actors with [Southern Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales") accents).[^35] The adaptation was subsequently released on audio cassette.

In April and May 2015, [BBC Radio 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4 "BBC Radio 4") aired a new, six-part dramatization of the *Earthsea* works, encompassing the storylines and motifs of the novels *A Wizard of Earthsea*, *The Tombs of Atuan* and *The Farthest Shore*.[^36] The first of the six 30 minute-long episodes premiered on April 27 and the last on May 5. The characters of Ged and Tenar were portrayed by three actors at different stages in their lives (Kasper Hilton-Hille, [James McArdle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McArdle "James McArdle") and [Shaun Dooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Dooley "Shaun Dooley") as Ged; Nishi Malde, [Aysha Kala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aysha_Kala "Aysha Kala") and [Vineeta Rishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineeta_Rishi "Vineeta Rishi") as Tenar). The radio drama was adapted by Judith Adams, directed by [Sasha Yevtushenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_Yevtushenko "Sasha Yevtushenko") and featured original music composed by Jon Nicholls. Following the premiere radio broadcast, each of the episodes were made available for online streaming on [BBC Radio 4 Extra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4_Extra "BBC Radio 4 Extra") for a month, via the [BBC iPlayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer "BBC iPlayer") service.[^37] The adaptation was created and aired as part of a thematic month centered on the life and works of Ursula Le Guin, in commemoration of her then-recent 85th birthday.[^38] In addition to the *Earthsea* radio drama, the thematic month included the airing of a two-part radio adaptation of *[The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness "The Left Hand of Darkness")* earlier in April, as well as exclusive interviews with Le Guin and some of the writers she inspired.[^39] [^40] [^41]

### Television

#### Miniseries, 2004

In December 2004, the U.S.-based [Sci Fi Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci_Fi_Channel "Sci Fi Channel") broadcast a three-hour loose adaptation of *A Wizard of Earthsea* and *The Tombs of Atuan* for television, entitled *[Legend of Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Earthsea "Legend of Earthsea")* (later, simply *Earthsea*). It was broadcast in two parts on [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4 "Channel 4") in the UK at Easter 2005. Sci Fi Channel had angered Le Guin [^42] and fans of the Earthsea novels with its announcement that Ged and the vast majority of the other characters would be played by [Caucasians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people "White people") and with the [dramatis personæ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatis_person%C3%A6 "Dramatis personæ") posted on an official website. The latter revealed several original characters – such as "The Archmagus" and "King Tygath", "Diana", "Penelope", and "Marion" – and it referred to "Kargide" characters rather than Kargad, Karg, or Kargish. The religious practices of Atuan were portrayed differently in the adaptation, and the celibacy of Earthsea wizards overlooked as Ged and Tenar become sexually involved. Referring to the writers of the show, Le Guin said "I have blasted them for [whitewashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewashing_in_film "Whitewashing in film") Earthsea, and do not forgive them for it." [^43]

One month before the U.S. broadcast, Le Guin posted on her website "A Reply to Some Statements Made by the Film-Makers" published in the December 2004 issue of *Sci Fi Magazine*. She opened with the observation, "I've tried very hard to keep from saying anything at all about this production, being well aware that movies must differ in many ways from the books they're based on, and feeling that I really had no business talking about it, since I was not included in planning it and was given no part in discussions or decisions." (Director [Robert Lieberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lieberman "Robert Lieberman"), too, had stated that she was not involved.) [^44]

"That makes it particularly galling of the director to put words in my mouth." [^44] Le Guin disavowed some specific interpretations both by Lieberman and by executive director [Robert Halmi Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Halmi_Sr. "Robert Halmi Sr."), and concluded (quoting Lieberman):

> I wonder if the people who made the [film of *The Lord of the Rings*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\(film_series\) "The Lord of the Rings (film series)") had ended it with Frodo putting on the Ring and ruling happily ever after, and then claimed that that was what [Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien") "intended..."\[,\] would people think they'd been "very, very honest to the books"?[^44]

In May 2018, it was announced that the series had been opted for a film adaptation by producer [Jennifer Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Fox_\(film_producer\) "Jennifer Fox (film producer)").[^45] In 2019, it was decided to produce a TV series instead.[^46]

Nothing has been heard of this proposed series since.

[Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli "Studio Ghibli") 's 2006 film *[Tales from Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_Earthsea_\(film\) "Tales from Earthsea (film)")* is loosely based in the Earthsea mythology. It was directed by [Gorō Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gor%C5%8D_Miyazaki "Gorō Miyazaki"), the son of [Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki "Hayao Miyazaki"). Le Guin granted Studio Ghibli the rights due to her love of Hayao Miyazaki's films.[^47] Le Guin called the adaptation "disappointing" and "entirely different" from her creation.[^47]
