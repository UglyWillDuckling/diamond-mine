***Mother*** <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> (known as ***EarthBound*** outside Japan) is a video game series that consists of [three](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy "Trilogy") [role-playing video games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_games "Role-playing video games"): *[Mother](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_\(video_game\) "Mother (video game)")* (1989), known as *EarthBound Beginnings* outside Japan, for the [Family Computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System "Nintendo Entertainment System"); *Mother 2* (1994), known as *[EarthBound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound "EarthBound")* outside Japan, for the [Super Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"); and *[Mother 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3 "Mother 3")* (2006) for the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance").

Written by [Shigesato Itoi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigesato_Itoi "Shigesato Itoi"), published by [Nintendo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo "Nintendo"), and featuring [game mechanics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics "Game mechanics") modeled on the *[Dragon Quest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest "Dragon Quest")* series, *Mother* is known for its sense of humor, originality, and parody. The player uses weapons and psychic powers to fight hostile enemies, which include animated everyday objects, aliens and brainwashed people. Signature elements of the series include a lighthearted approach to the plot, battle sequences with psychedelic backgrounds, and the "rolling [HP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_\(gaming\) "Health (gaming)") meter": player health ticks down like an [odometer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometer "Odometer") rather than instantly being subtracted, allowing the player to take preventative action, such as healing or finishing the battle, before the damage is fully dealt. While the franchise is popular in Japan, in the [Anglosphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere "Anglosphere") it is best associated with the [cult following behind *EarthBound*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound_fandom "EarthBound fandom").

While visiting Nintendo for other business, Itoi approached [Shigeru Miyamoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto "Shigeru Miyamoto") about making *Mother*. When approved for a sequel, Itoi increased his involvement in the design process over the five-year development of *EarthBound*. When the project began to flounder, producer and later Nintendo president [Satoru Iwata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Iwata "Satoru Iwata") rescued the game. *EarthBound* 's English localizers were given great liberties when translating the Japanese game's cultural allusions. The American version sold poorly despite a multimillion-dollar marketing budget. *Mother 3* was originally slated for release on the Nintendo 64 and its [64DD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/64DD "64DD") disk drive accessory, but was cancelled in 2000. Three years later, the project was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance alongside a rerelease of *Mother* and *Mother 2* in the combined cartridge *Mother 1 + 2*. *Mother 3* abandoned the 3D graphics progress for a 2D style, and became a bestseller upon its release. *EarthBound* was rereleased for the Wii U [Virtual Console](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Console "Virtual Console") in 2013, and *Mother* received its English-language debut for the same platform in 2015, retitled *EarthBound Beginnings*. In 2022, Nintendo released *Mother 1* and *2* to their [Nintendo Switch Online](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_Online "Nintendo Switch Online") service. *Mother 3* later came to the service exclusively in Japan in 2024.

*EarthBound* is widely regarded as a video game classic, and is included in multiple top-ten lists. In absence of continued official support for the series, members of the *EarthBound* fan community organized online to advocate for further series releases through petitions and fan art. Their projects include a full [fan translation of *Mother 3*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3_fan_translation "Mother 3 fan translation"), a full-length documentary, and [fangame attempts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound_fandom#Fangames "EarthBound fandom"). [Ness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ness_\(EarthBound\) "Ness (EarthBound)"), the protagonist of *EarthBound* and [Lucas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3 "Mother 3"), the protagonist of *Mother 3*, received exposure from their inclusion in the *[Super Smash Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros. "Super Smash Bros.")* series. Other *Mother* series locations and characters have made appearances in the fighting games.
