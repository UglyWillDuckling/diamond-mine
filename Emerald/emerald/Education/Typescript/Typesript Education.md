### notes 📔
* think about object orientation - how does typescript fit into all of this?
	* can we do everything that we can i let's say [[smalltalk]] or [[ruby]]? Can we do **more**?

### what we'l do today 📆

#### day 1
First, we can continue the course on [Execute program](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/everyday-typescript) that will give us a practical understanding of typescript covering most of its basic and some more advanced features using everyday easy to understand examples, [[execute program courses 🎓]].

#manifesto #core #basics
After the course, we move on to typescript basics using the roadmap and following the essential [documentation](documentation) needed to understand the core of  [[typescript]] and not get lost 🧭.

Afterwords, we move, rather quickly, to start to build an actual app using typescript. Don't to the **todo** list today please 🙏, do something different to get started like:

* **game** - very playful and you get to use objects more
* **plugin** for [[Obsidian]] - very useful and can be based of off existing code
* ... 
#### day 2
Today, we continue with our exploration of [[typescript]] by diving deeper into the main documentation files [[typescript documentation]]. 
Then, we will descend into 🏊‍♀deeper waters by following the [[Learning TypeScript book]] book which offers a great introduction into both [[javascript]] and [[typescript]], providing an excellent way of slowly trasitioning to a fully typed programming langauge. It also has a great learning curve going from the basics all the to the highly advanced stuff.

**ideas** 💡
- create  a Kanban board with the list of items that need doing
* ~~create a directory for education -> typescript~~
	- gather resources
* explore typescript online
	* use the existing task on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/v-sedlar/Study-Learn-Typescript-28599ce232af430e91b564343fe533d2)
* connect everything back to [[object orientation]] and other programming languages
	* don't forget 🤯 what you already know...
* make a **canvas**  containing stuff that I've learned about typescript
