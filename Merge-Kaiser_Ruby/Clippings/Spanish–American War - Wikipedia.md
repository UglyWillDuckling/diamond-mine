The **Spanish–American War** <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-alternative_names-5"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> (April 21 – August 13, 1898) was fought between [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_\(Spain\) "Restoration (Spain)") and the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") in 1898. It began with the sinking of the [USS *Maine*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_\(1889\) "USS Maine (1889)") in [Havana Harbor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_Harbor "Havana Harbor") in [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"), and resulted in the U.S. acquiring [sovereignty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty") over [Puerto Rico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico"), [Guam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam "Guam"), and the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines"), and establishing a [protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate "Protectorate") over Cuba. It represented U.S. intervention in the [Cuban War of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_War_of_Independence "Cuban War of Independence") and [Philippine Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Revolution "Philippine Revolution"), with the latter later leading to the [Philippine–American War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War "Philippine–American War"). The Spanish–American War brought an end to almost four centuries of Spanish presence in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific; the United States meanwhile not only became a major world power, but also gained several island possessions spanning the globe, which provoked rancorous debate over the wisdom of [expansionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansionism "Expansionism").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>

The 19th century represented a clear decline for the [Spanish Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire"), while the United States went from a newly founded country to a rising power. In 1895, Cuban nationalists began a revolt against Spanish rule, which was brutally suppressed by the colonial authorities.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-historian-31"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> W. Joseph Campbell argues that [yellow journalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism "Yellow journalism") in the U.S. exaggerated the atrocities in Cuba to sell more newspapers and magazines,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> which swayed American public opinion in support of the rebels. But historian Andrea Pitzer also points to the actual shift toward savagery of the Spanish military leadership, who adopted the brutal [reconcentration policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconcentration_policy "Reconcentration policy") after replacing the relatively conservative Governor-General of Cuba [Arsenio Martínez Campos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenio_Mart%C3%ADnez_Campos "Arsenio Martínez Campos") with the more unscrupulous and aggressive [Valeriano Weyler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeriano_Weyler "Valeriano Weyler"), nicknamed "The Butcher." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> President [Grover Cleveland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland "Grover Cleveland") resisted mounting demands for U.S. intervention, as did his successor [William McKinley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley "William McKinley").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Though not seeking a war, McKinley made preparations in readiness for one.

In January 1898, the [U.S. Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") armored cruiser USS *Maine* was sent to Havana to provide protection for U.S. citizens. After the *Maine* was sunk by a mysterious explosion in the harbor on February 15, 1898, political pressures pushed McKinley to receive congressional authority to use military force. On April 21, the U.S. began a blockade of Cuba,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-trask57-6"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> and soon after Spain and the U.S. declared war. The war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, where American war advocates correctly anticipated that U.S. naval power would prove decisive. On May 1, a squadron of U.S. warships [destroyed the Spanish fleet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_Bay "Battle of Manila Bay") at Manila Bay in the Philippines and captured the harbor. The first U.S. Marines landed in Cuba on June 10 in the island's southeast, moving west and engaging in the [Battles of El Caney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_El_Caney "Battle of El Caney") and [San Juan Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Juan_Hill "Battle of San Juan Hill") on July 1 and then destroying the fleet at and capturing Santiago de Cuba on July 17.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> On June 20, the island of [Guam surrendered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Guam "Capture of Guam") without resistance, and on July 25, U.S. troops [landed on Puerto Rico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico_campaign "Puerto Rico campaign"), of which a blockade had begun on May 8 and where fighting continued until an armistice was signed on August 13.

The war formally ended with the [1898 Treaty of Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1898\) "Treaty of Paris (1898)"), signed on December 10 with terms favorable to the U.S. The treaty ceded ownership of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the U.S., and set Cuba up to become an independent state in 1902, although in practice it became a U.S. protectorate. The cession of the Philippines involved payment of $20 million ($760 million today) to Spain by the U.S. to cover infrastructure owned by Spain.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> In Spain, the defeat in the war was a profound shock to the national psyche and provoked a thorough philosophical and artistic reevaluation of Spanish society known as the [Generation of '98](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_of_%2798 "Generation of '98").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-108%E2%80%93109-38"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup>
