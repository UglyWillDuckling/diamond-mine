Today we're going to introduce bayesian statistics and discuss how this new approach to statistics has revolutionized the field from artificial intelligence and clinical trials to how your computer filters spam! We'll also discuss the Law of Large Numbers and how we can use simulations to help us better understand the "rules" of our data, even if we don't know the equations that define those rules.  
  
Want to try out the law of large numbers simulation yourself? More details here:

# Notes

- [[Bayes Theorem]]
	- `P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B) / P(A)`

$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}$$
$$\frac{a}{b}$$
$$\frac{a}{c} \sum^{1}_{44}$$

we need to update our believes.
