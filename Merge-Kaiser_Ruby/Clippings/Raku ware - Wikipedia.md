**Raku ware** ( [楽焼](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A5%BD%E7%84%BC "wiktionary:楽焼"), *raku-yaki* ) is a type of [Japanese pottery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pottery_and_porcelain "Japanese pottery and porcelain") traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies, most often in the form of *[chawan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chawan "Chawan")* tea bowls.

It is traditionally characterised by being hand-shaped rather than thrown, fairly porous vessels, which result from low firing temperatures, [lead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead")[glazes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_glaze "Ceramic glaze") and the removal of pieces from the [kiln](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln "Kiln") while still glowing hot. In the traditional Japanese process, the fired raku piece is removed from the hot kiln and is allowed to cool in the open air.

The final phase in the **Western technique**

The Western version of raku was developed in the 20th century by [studio potters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_potter "Studio potter"). Typically wares are fired at a high temperature, and after removing pieces from the kiln, the wares are placed in an open-air container filled with combustible material, which is not a traditional Raku practice in Japan. The Western process can give a great variety of colors and surface effects, making it very popular with studio and amateur potters.
