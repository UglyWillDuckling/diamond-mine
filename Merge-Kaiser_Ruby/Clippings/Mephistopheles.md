**Mephistopheles**[^1] (, German pronunciation: [\[mefɪˈstoːfɛlɛs\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German")), also known as **Mephisto**,[^:1-2] is a [demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon "Demon") featured in [German folklore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_folklore "German folklore"). He originally appeared in literature as the demon in the [Faust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust "Faust") legend and has since become a [stock character](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_character "Stock character") appearing in [other works of arts and popular culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephistopheles_in_the_arts_and_popular_culture "Mephistopheles in the arts and popular culture").

## Etymology and name meaning

The name *Mephistopheles* is a corrupted [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") [compound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_\(linguistics\) "Compound (linguistics)").[^:0-3] The Greek [particle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_\(linguistics\) "Particle (linguistics)") of [negation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmation_and_negation#Negation "Affirmation and negation") (μή, *mē*) and the Greek word for "[love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia "Philia")" or "loving" (φίλος, *philos*) are the first and last terms of the compound, but the middle term is more doubtful. Three possible meanings have been proposed, and three different etymologies have been offered:

- "not loving light" (φῶς, *phōs*; the old form of the name being *Mephostopheles*)
- "not loving Faust"
- *[mephitic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mephitic "wikt:mephitic"),* pertaining to poisonous vapors arising from pools, caverns, and springs.[^:0-3]

It is likely that the name was invented for the historical [alchemist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemist "Alchemist") [Johann Georg Faust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Faust "Johann Georg Faust") by the anonymous author of the first *[Faustbuch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faustbuch "Faustbuch")* (published 1587).[^:1-2]

Mephistopheles is associated with the Faust legend of an ambitious scholar, based on the historical [Johann Georg Faust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Faust "Johann Georg Faust"). In the legend, Faust makes a [deal with the devil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_devil "Deal with the devil") at the price of his soul, Mephistopheles acting as the devil's agent.

The name appears in the late-sixteenth-century [Faust chapbooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust_chapbooks "Faust chapbooks") – stories concerning the life of Johann Georg Faust, written by an anonymous German author.

In the 1725 version, which [Goethe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe") read, *Mephostophiles* is a [devil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil "Devil") in the form of a [greyfriar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans "Franciscans") summoned by Faust in a wood outside [Wittenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg "Wittenberg").

From the chapbooks, the name entered Faustian literature. Many authors have used it, from Goethe to [Christopher Marlowe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe "Christopher Marlowe"). In the 1616 edition of Marlowe's *[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tragical_History_of_Doctor_Faustus "The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus")*, *Mephostophiles* became *Mephistophilis*.

Mephistopheles in later treatments of the Faust material frequently figures as a title character: in [Meyer Lutz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_Lutz "Meyer Lutz")'s *[Mephistopheles, or Faust and Marguerite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust_and_Marguerite_\(opera\) "Faust and Marguerite (opera)")* (1855), [Arrigo Boito](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrigo_Boito "Arrigo Boito")'s *[Mefistofele](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefistofele "Mefistofele")* (1868), [Klaus Mann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Mann "Klaus Mann")'s *[Mephisto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephisto_\(novel\) "Mephisto (novel)")*, and [Franz Liszt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Liszt "Franz Liszt")'s *[Mephisto Waltzes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephisto_Waltzes "Mephisto Waltzes")*. There are also many parallels with the character of Mephistopheles and the character Lord Henry Wotton in *[The Picture of Dorian Gray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray "The Picture of Dorian Gray")* by [Oscar Wilde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde "Oscar Wilde").[^4]

*Mephistopheles* by [Mark Antokolsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antokolsky "Mark Antokolsky"), 1884

Although Mephistopheles appears to Faustus as a [demon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon "Demon") – a worker for [Lucifer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer "Lucifer") – critics claim that he does not search for men to corrupt, but comes to serve and ultimately collect the souls of those who are already damned. Farnham explains, "Nor does Mephistophiles first appear to Faustus as a devil who walks up and down on earth to tempt and corrupt any man encountered. He appears because he senses in Faustus' magical summons that Faustus is already corrupt, that indeed he is already 'in danger to be damned'."[^5]

Mephistopheles is already trapped in his own [Hell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell") by serving the Devil. He warns Faustus of the choice he is making by "selling his soul" to the devil: "Mephistophilis, an agent of Lucifer, appears and at first advises Faust not to forego the promise of [heaven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven") to pursue his goals".[^6] Farnham adds to his theory, "...\[Faustus\] enters an ever-present private hell like that of Mephistophiles".[^7]
