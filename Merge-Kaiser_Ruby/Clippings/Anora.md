The film was named one of the top ten films of 2024 by the [National Board of Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review "National Board of Review") and the [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute").

Anora "Ani" Mikheeva, a 23-year-old [stripper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripper "Stripper"), lives in [Brighton Beach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Beach "Brighton Beach"), a [Russian-American neighborhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Americans_in_New_York_City "Russian Americans in New York City") in [Brooklyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn"), New York City. Her boss introduces her to Ivan "Vanya" Zakharov, the 21-year-old son of the [Russian oligarch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs "Russian oligarchs") Nikolai Zakharov, who requests someone fluent in Russian. Though Vanya is in the U.S. to study, he spends most of his time partying in clubs and playing video games in his lavish Brooklyn mansion.

Vanya hires Anora for several sexual encounters. He invites her to a New Year’s Eve party at the mansion, and the following morning, he offers her $15,000 to be his girlfriend for a week. During the week, Anora parties with Vanya and his friends, and they all go on an extravagant trip to Las Vegas. At the end of the trip, Vanya reveals that he has to return to Russia permanently to work at his father’s company and expresses disdain for his parents. He suggests that he will not have to leave if he marries an American and impulsively proposes marriage. Anora is reluctant at first but agrees after Vanya assures her that his feelings are genuine. They elope at a Vegas wedding chapel. Vanya then buys her a large engagement ring and an expensive fur coat. She resigns from her job and moves into Vanya's mansion. When news of their marriage reaches Russia, Vanya's mother, Galina, orders his Armenian godfather, Toros, to find them and arrange an [annulment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment "Annulment") while she and Nikolai fly to the U.S.

Toros sends his henchmen, Garnik and Igor, to the mansion. They inform Vanya that his parents are taking him back to Russia and enrages Anora by calling her a prostitute, suggesting Vanya only married her for a [green card](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card "Green card"). Vanya flees the premises, and Anora engages in a violent struggle with Garnik and Igor before they restrain her. When Toros arrives, he tells Anora that Vanya’s mansion and wealth belong to his parents and that he is financially dependent on them. He confiscates her wedding ring, gags her, and offers her $10,000 for the annulment. Anora insists she and Vanya are in love, but she agrees to help find him.

Anora, Toros, Garnik, and Igor search Brooklyn. Anora learns from friends that Vanya is at her former strip club, where he is being entertained by a rival dancer. They drag Vanya out of the club, but he is too intoxicated to listen to them, and the group is forced to wait outside the courthouse overnight. The annulment is dismissed since the marriage took place in Nevada.

At the airport, Anora introduces herself to Nikolai and Galina in Russian, but Galina rejects her. Conceding to his parents, Vanya tells Anora their marriage must end and reveals that he was using her for selfish purposes all along. Galina orders everyone onto a plane to Las Vegas. Having not signed a [prenuptial agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement "Prenuptial agreement"), Anora pledges to file for a divorce settlement, but Galina threatens her with financial ruin if she does not comply. Realizing Vanya's spinelessness and his family's power, Anora signs the annulment papers. Igor suggests Vanya apologize, but Galina refuses. Anora insults them both before leaving, telling Galina that Vanya married her to spite his mother, to Nikolai's amusement.

Igor takes Anora back to New York to collect her belongings. At the mansion, she confronts Igor about their encounter, accusing him of assault and saying he would have raped her if they had been alone, an accusation Igor denies. The next morning, Igor gives Anora the money and drives her home. In the car, he returns her wedding ring as a gesture of goodwill. Anora initiates sex with him but stops when he tries to kiss her; she breaks down and sobs in his arms.

 Director [Sean Baker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Baker "Sean Baker") with his wife and co-producer [Samantha Quan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Quan "Samantha Quan")

The director, [Sean Baker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Baker "Sean Baker"), said *Anora* was inspired by a story from a friend about a Russian-American newlywed kidnapped for collateral. He was also inspired by his work in 2000 and 2001, when he edited wedding videos, including ones of Russian-Americans in New York.[^sohf-8]  Baker said his intentions were towards "telling human stories, by telling stories that are hopefully universal \[...\] It's helping remove the stigma that's been applied to \[sex work\], that's always been applied to this livelihood."[^indiewire-9] Baker hired [Andrea Werhun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Werhun "Andrea Werhun"), a Canadian writer and actress known for her 2018 memoir *Modern Whore* about her prior time as a sex worker, as a creative consultant.[^10]

Baker cast [Mikey Madison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_Madison "Mikey Madison") after seeing her in *[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Hollywood "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood")* (2019) and *[Scream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_\(2022_film\) "Scream (2022 film)")* (2022).[^sohf-8] [^new_yorker-11] He hired Madison without an audition.[^mikey-12] Madison learned Russian, visited strip clubs, and studied the [Brooklyn accent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_accent "Brooklyn accent") to prepare.[^mikey-12] Although some media outlets incorrectly reported that Anora Mikheeva was [Uzbek-American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_Americans "Uzbek Americans"), Baker said that Anora "is of [Russian ethnicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians "Russians")" and "from one of the [post-Soviet countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states "Post-Soviet states")".[^new_yorker-11][^13][^14]

[Principal photography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography "Principal photography") took place starting in February 2023 in Brooklyn, including the neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, [Coney Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island "Coney Island"), and [Sheepshead Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepshead_Bay,_Brooklyn "Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn").[^reteam-15][^kodak-16] *Anora* was filmed over 37 days, with the 25-minute home invasion scene taking 10 days. It was shot on [Kodak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak "Kodak") [35 mm film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_movie_film "35 mm movie film") framed in [4-perf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pulldown "Negative pulldown") widescreen [anamorphic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphic_format "Anamorphic format") using an [Arricam LT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arricam "Arricam"), with [color correction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_correction "Color correction") completed via [DaVinci Resolve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve "DaVinci Resolve") at [FotoKem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FotoKem "FotoKem").[^kodak-16][^sohf-8]  Vintage [LOMO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOMO "LOMO") [prime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_lens "Prime lens") and [zoom lenses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens "Zoom lens") were mainly used for filming, while Atlas Orion lenses were used for low-light scenes.[^kodak-16] Scenes were also shot at the [Palms Casino Resort](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palms_Casino_Resort "Palms Casino Resort") and on [Fremont Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Street "Fremont Street") in [Las Vegas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas "Las Vegas").[^kodak-16] The film's cinematography was inspired by 1970s crime dramas set in New York, including *[The French Connection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Connection_\(film\) "The French Connection (film)")* and *[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taking_of_Pelham_One_Two_Three_\(1974_film\) "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)")*.[^kodak-16] Alex Coco, one of the producers, worked as a disc jockey for the music in the scenes in the club.[^sohf-8]  Baker is credited with the casting, with the cast including more than 30 different speaking parts.[^sohf-8] 

For the Zakharov mansion, Baker filmed at 2458 National Drive, a [Mill Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_Basin,_Brooklyn "Mill Basin, Brooklyn") mansion once owned by [Vasily Anisimov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Anisimov "Vasily Anisimov"), an oligarch with ties to Russia. Baker had searched on [Google](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search "Google Search") for "the biggest and best mansion in Brighton Beach".[^17] To learn more about the area, Baker and Mikey Madison temporarily moved to southern Brooklyn during pre-production. Toros and Ani's search for Vanya was filmed in several restaurants and clubs that the producers had frequented.[^18]

At a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, Madison said that Baker and the producer [Samantha Quan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Quan "Samantha Quan"), Baker's wife, would act out different sex positions to demonstrate what they wanted the actors to do. Madison was offered an [intimacy coordinator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimacy_coordinator "Intimacy coordinator"), but said: "As I'd already created a really comfortable relationship with both of them for about a year, I felt that that would be where I was most comfortable with and it ended up working so perfectly."[^indiewire-9]

The soundtrack includes [Robin Schulz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Schulz "Robin Schulz") rework of "[Greatest Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Day_\(Take_That_song\) "Greatest Day (Take That song)")" by [Take That](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_That "Take That") and "[All the Things She Said](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Things_She_Said "All the Things She Said")" by [t.A.T.u.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.A.T.u. "T.A.T.u.") Madison also said that her friend curated a "stripper playlist" for her to get into character, including tracks from [Cardi B](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B "Cardi B"), [Megan Thee Stallion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion "Megan Thee Stallion") and [Slayyyter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayyyter "Slayyyter").[^19]

Worldwide distribution rights were acquired by [FilmNation Entertainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FilmNation_Entertainment "FilmNation Entertainment") in October 2023. The film was then sold by FilmNation to [Le Pacte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Pacte "Le Pacte") for France, Lev for Israel, Kismet for Australia and New Zealand, and [Focus Features](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_Features "Focus Features")/[Universal Pictures International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures_International "Universal Pictures International") for the rest of the world excluding North America in deals similar to those made on Baker's previous film, *[Red Rocket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rocket_\(film\) "Red Rocket (film)")*.[^reteam-15] In November 2023, [Neon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_\(company\) "Neon (company)") acquired North American distribution rights to the film,[^20] and opened it in [limited release](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release "Limited theatrical release") on October 18, 2024.[^21][^22]

[Greta Gerwig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Gerwig "Greta Gerwig"), serving as the president of the [77th Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Cannes_Film_Festival "2024 Cannes Film Festival") Jury, commented that "\[*Anora*\] was something we collectively felt we were transported by, we were moved by \[...\] It felt both new and in conversation with older forms of cinema. There was something about it that reminded us of \[the\] classic structures of [Lubitsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch "Ernst Lubitsch") or [Howard Hawks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hawks "Howard Hawks"), and then it did something completely truthful and unexpected."[^50]

[Richard Lawson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawson_\(writer\) "Richard Lawson (writer)") of *[Vanity Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\(magazine\) "Vanity Fair (magazine)")* wrote: "\[*Anora* is\] a wild, profane blast \[...\] Even when Baker's storytelling and dialogue gets repetitive, Madison keeps things lively \[...\] Still, a darkness thrums under the surface of all this flirting and bickering. Ani is forever yanked this way and that, degraded and disregarded \[...\] I found myself torn between finding Baker's conclusions compassionate and sensing a vague whiff of something patronizing."[^51] [Justin Chang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Chang "Justin Chang") of *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* wrote: "*Anora* plays like a wild dream—first joyous, then catastrophic, and always fiercely unpredictable \[...\] A contemporary return to screwball tradition is a welcome but challenging proposition, and Baker's play with the form is hardly seamless. \[*Anora*\] built up a righteous steam of fury, now unleashes it against the Ivans of the world and salutes those toiling thanklessly in their employ."[^new_yorker-11]

*[Sight and Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_and_Sound "Sight and Sound")* named *Anora* the second-best film of 2024,[^52] and *[Film Comment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Comment "Film Comment")* named it one of the ten best.[^53] In 2025, *[Collider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_\(website\) "Collider (website)")* ranked the film at number 36 on its list of "The 40 Best Movies of the 2020s", with Jeremy Urquhart terming it "something of a modern classic".[^54] *Anora* was praised by many filmmakers and actors.[^55][^56][^57][^58][^59][^60][^61] However, one commentator, Russian-Jewish screenwriter [Mikhail Idov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Idov&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mikhail Idov (page does not exist)") \[[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB "ru:Идов, Михаил")\], found it difficult to reconcile support for the film, given the ongoing [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine"); he commented in the *[New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times "New York Times")* on February 27, 2025, "Its Oscar nominations, especially the best supporting actor one for Yura Borisov, have been touted by some as a national victory in Russia. Which puts me in the unsettling position of being in some truly terrible company in cheering for it."[^62]

#### Reaction from sex workers

*Anora* received praise from some [sex workers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_work "Sex work") for its depiction of the profession, which they described as a step forward from films of the past that tended to portray sex work as a social transgression worthy of condemnation.[^roberts-63][^burana-64][^zeitchik-65] In a piece for *[Slate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_\(magazine\) "Slate (magazine)")*, Risdon Roberts compared the character of Ani to Vivian Ward in *[Pretty Woman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Woman "Pretty Woman")*, writing the former "is not a desperate or trafficked waif, nor is she a [hooker with a heart of gold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooker_with_a_heart_of_gold "Hooker with a heart of gold"). Baker doesn't even set out to make \[Ani\] worthy of *sympathy*—instead, we're in awe of her prowess as she works the floor of a high-end strip club while the opening credits play ... Right away, it's clear that we're rooting for Ani not because she's down and out like Vivian—we're rooting for her because she's shrewd and in control".[^roberts-63]

Tiff Smith said, "We're seeing a fully developed character doing sex work without their profession defining them—that's what representation really is."[^zeitchik-65] Some said Baker's hiring of sex workers for the production as consultants and cast members was reflected in the film's attention to detail like the mundane realities of strip club life and labor issues.[^werhun-66][^burana-64]

Others felt that the film reverted to regressive stereotypes about sex workers as downtrodden and "in need of saving".[^roberts-63][^cruz-67][^dawson-68] A UK-based sex worker commented that the film "rehashes the 'traumatised, vulnerable sex worker' trope, which we've seen a thousand times before".[^dawson-68] Marla Cruz opined that little is revealed about Ani's life outside of sex work, and that an exploration of the "boundary between Ani the person and Ani the worker" is absent.[^cruz-67] Ayanna Dozier wrote "the film narratively builds upon and follows the social imaginaries of sex workers as subhuman projections for other people's fantasies".[^dozier-69] Cruz wrote that it is debatable "whether Ani becomes more clear-eyed about her relationship to power, men, and money throughout the film".[^cruz-67] Though Roberts appreciated the film generally, she critiqued the ending, writing that for real-life sex workers, the true goal is not to be saved by a man, but "is about *survival* (or, ideally, transcending the need to survive)".[^roberts-63] She added that rather than representing the [knights in shining armor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_in_shining_armor "Knight in shining armor") archetype, "Clients are a means to an end. Money can't break your heart."[^roberts-63]
