**Hypatia**[^4] (born c. 350–370 - March 415 AD)[^mactutormath-1][^5] was a [Neoplatonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonist "Neoplatonist") philosopher, astronomer, and [mathematician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") who lived in [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_\(Roman_province\) "Egypt (Roman province)"), then part of the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire"). She was a prominent thinker in Alexandria where she taught [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") and [astronomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy").[^6] Although preceded by [Pandrosion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandrosion "Pandrosion"), another Alexandrian [female mathematician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_mathematician "Female mathematician"),[^7] she is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.[^footnotedeakin2012-8] Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. She wrote a commentary on [Diophantus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantus "Diophantus")'s thirteen-volume *[Arithmetica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetica "Arithmetica")*, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus's original text, and another commentary on [Apollonius of Perga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga")'s treatise on [conic sections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_sections "Conic sections"), which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of [Ptolemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")'s *[Almagest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")*, based on the title of her father [Theon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theon_of_Alexandria "Theon of Alexandria")'s commentary on Book III of the *Almagest*.

Hypatia constructed [astrolabes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe") and [hydrometers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometer "Hydrometer"), but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. She was tolerant toward [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christianity "Early Christianity") and taught many Christian students, including [Synesius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesius "Synesius"), the future bishop of [Ptolemais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemais,_Cyrenaica "Ptolemais, Cyrenaica"). Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Toward the end of her life, Hypatia advised [Orestes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestes_\(prefect\) "Orestes (prefect)"), the [Roman prefect of Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Roman_Egypt "List of governors of Roman Egypt"), who was in the midst of a political feud with [Cyril](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_of_Alexandria "Cyril of Alexandria"), the [bishop of Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_of_Alexandria "Patriarch of Alexandria"). Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a [lector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_\(liturgy\) "Reader (liturgy)") named Peter.[^9][^footnotedeakin1994147-10]

Hypatia's murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a "[martyr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr "Martyr") for philosophy", leading future Neoplatonists such as the historian [Damascius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascius "Damascius") (c. 458 – c. 538) to become increasingly fervent in their [opposition to Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Christianity "Criticism of Christianity"). During the [Middle Ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of [Christian virtue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_virtues "Theological virtues") and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of [Saint Catherine of Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Alexandria "Catherine of Alexandria"). During the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), she became a symbol of opposition to [Catholicism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"). In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially [Charles Kingsley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kingsley "Charles Kingsley")'s 1853 novel *[Hypatia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia_\(novel\) "Hypatia (novel)")*, romanticized her as "the last of the [Hellenes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks#Names "Greeks")". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for [women's rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights "Women's rights") and a precursor to the [feminist movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_movement "Feminist movement"). Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia's death with the destruction of the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria "Library of Alexandria"), despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia's lifetime.[^footnotetheodore2016182%e2%80%93183-11]
