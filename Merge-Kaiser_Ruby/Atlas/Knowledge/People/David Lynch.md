**David Keith Lynch** (January 20, 1946 – January 15, 2025) was an American filmmaker, visual artist, musician, and actor. Often called a " [visionary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visionary "Visionary") " and acclaimed for [films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch_filmography "David Lynch filmography") distinguished by their [surrealist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_cinema "Surrealist cinema") and [experimental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_film "Experimental film") qualities, Lynch is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the [history of cinema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cinema "History of cinema").[^1] In a career spanning more than five decades, he received [numerous accolades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accolades_received_by_David_Lynch "List of accolades received by David Lynch"), including the [Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lion_for_Lifetime_Achievement "Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement") at the [Venice Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival "Venice Film Festival") in 2006 and an [Academy Honorary Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award "Academy Honorary Award") in 2019.

Lynch studied painting and made short films before making his first feature, the independent [body horror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_horror "Body horror") film *[Eraserhead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead "Eraserhead")* (1977), which found success as a [midnight movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_movie "Midnight movie").

Lynch also worked as a musician, releasing solo and collaborative albums, and as a furniture designer, [cartoonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoonist "Cartoonist"), animator, photographer, sculptor, and author. A practitioner of [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation "Transcendental Meditation"), he founded the [David Lynch Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch_Foundation "David Lynch Foundation") to fund meditation lessons for at-risk populations. A lifelong smoker, he died from complications of [emphysema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema "Emphysema") after being evacuated from his home due to the [January 2025 Southern California wildfires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2025_Southern_California_wildfires "January 2025 Southern California wildfires").[^7]

> My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. [Middle America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_America_\(US\) "Middle America (US)") as it's supposed to be. But on the cherry tree there's this pitch oozing out – some black, some yellow, and millions of [red ants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_ants "Red ants") crawling all over it. I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are *always* red ants underneath. Because I grew up in a perfect world, other things were a contrast.

David Keith Lynch was born in [Missoula, Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula,_Montana "Missoula, Montana"), on January 20, 1946.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 1">: 1 </span></sup>  His father, Donald Walton Lynch (1915–2007), was a research scientist working for the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Agriculture "U.S. Department of Agriculture") (USDA), and his mother, Edwina "Sunny" Lynch (née Sundholm; 1919–2004), was an English-language tutor. Two of Lynch's maternal great-grandparents were [Finnish-Swedish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish-speaking_population_of_Finland "Swedish-speaking population of Finland") immigrants who arrived in the U.S. during the 19th century.[^9] He recalled that his father "would drive me through the woods in his green Forest Service truck, over dirt roads, through the most beautiful forests where the trees are very tall and shafts of sunlight come down and in the mountain streams the rainbow trout leap out and their little trout sides catch glimpses of light. Then my father would drop me in the woods and go off. It was a weird, comforting feeling being in the woods." [^10] He was raised as a [Presbyterian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian "Presbyterian").[^11] [^12] The Lynch family often moved around according to where the USDA assigned Donald: Lynch moved with his parents to [Sandpoint, Idaho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpoint,_Idaho "Sandpoint, Idaho"), when he was two months old; two years later, after his brother John was born, the family moved to [Spokane, Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington "Spokane, Washington").[^13] [^14] Lynch's sister Martha was born there. The family then moved to [Durham, North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina "Durham, North Carolina"), [Boise, Idaho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho "Boise, Idaho"), and [Alexandria, Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia "Alexandria, Virginia").[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 1">: 1 </span></sup>  Lynch adjusted to this transitory early life with relative ease, noting that he usually had no difficulty making new friends when he attended a new school.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 2–3">: 2–3 </span></sup>  Of his early life, he remarked:

> I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school... for me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 14">: 14 </span></sup>

Alongside his schooling, Lynch joined the [Boy Scouts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America "Boy Scouts of America"). Later, he said he "became \[a Scout\] so I could quit and put it behind me", and rose to the highest rank of [Eagle Scout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_\(Boy_Scouts_of_America\) "Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)"). Lynch befriended Toby Keeler, whose father, Bushnell, was a painter. Bushnell gave Lynch *The Art Spirit* by [Robert Henri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Henri "Robert Henri"). It was a revelation, and Lynch decided to dedicate himself to "the art life".[^15]<sup><span title="Page / location: 1">: 1 </span></sup> 

At [Francis C. Hammond High School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_C._Hammond_High_School "Francis C. Hammond High School") in Alexandria, Lynch did not excel academically, having little interest in schoolwork, but he was popular with other students, and after leaving he decided that he wanted to study painting at college. He began his studies at the [Corcoran School of the Arts and Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corcoran_School_of_the_Arts_and_Design "Corcoran School of the Arts and Design") in Washington, D.C., before transferring in 1964 to the [School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Museum_of_Fine_Arts,_Boston "School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston") with roommate musician [Peter Wolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wolf "Peter Wolf").[^16] [^17] [^18] He left after only a year, saying, "I was not inspired at all in that place." He instead decided that he wanted to travel around Europe for three years with his friend [Jack Fisk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Fisk "Jack Fisk"), who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [Cooper Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union "Cooper Union"). They had some hopes that they could train in Europe with Austrian [expressionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism "Expressionism") painter [Oskar Kokoschka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Kokoschka "Oskar Kokoschka") at his school. Upon reaching [Salzburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg "Salzburg"), however, they found that Kokoschka was not available. Disillusioned, they returned to the United States after spending only two weeks in Europe.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 31–34">: 31–34 </span></sup> 

Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia. Because his parents had moved to [Walnut Creek, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Creek,_California "Walnut Creek, California"), he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while.[^8]<sup><span title="Page: 36">: 36 </span></sup>  He decided to move to [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia") and enroll at the [Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Academy_of_the_Fine_Arts "Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts"), after advice from Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, saying, "In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 36–37">: 36–37 </span></sup>  He recalled that Philadelphia had "a great mood—factories, smoke, railroads, diners, the strangest characters and the darkest night. I saw vivid images—plastic curtains held together with Band-Aids, rags stuffed in broken windows." He was influenced by the Irish painter [Francis Bacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_\(artist\) "Francis Bacon (artist)").[^19] In Philadelphia, Lynch began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, whom he married in 1967. The next year, their daughter [Jennifer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lynch "Jennifer Lynch") was born. Peggy later said Lynch "definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 31">: 31 </span></sup>  As a family, they moved to Philadelphia's [Fairmount](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairmount,_Philadelphia "Fairmount, Philadelphia") neighborhood, where they bought a 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 (equivalent to $33,000 in 2024) due to the area's high crime and poverty rates. Lynch later said:

> We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street... We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in... The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 42–43">: 42–43 </span></sup> 

Meanwhile, to help support his family, Lynch took a job printing [engravings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engravings "Engravings").[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 43">: 43 </span></sup>  At the Pennsylvania Academy, Lynch made his first short film, *[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Men_Getting_Sick_\(Six_Times\) "Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)")* (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he began discussing creating animation with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone and purchased the cheapest 16mm camera he could find. Taking one of the academy's abandoned upper rooms as a workspace, he spent $150,[^20] which at the time he felt was a lot of money, to produce *Six Men Getting Sick*.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 37–38">: 37–38 </span></sup>  Calling the film "57 seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit", Lynch played it on a loop at the academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint-first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 38">: 38 </span></sup>  [^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 15–16">: 15–16 </span></sup>  This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1,000 (equivalent to $9,000 in 2024) to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478 of that on the second-hand [Bolex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolex "Bolex") camera "of \[his\] dreams", Lynch produced a new animated short but, upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was a blurred, frameless print. He later said, "So I called up \[Wasserman\] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 39">: 39 </span></sup> 

With his leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment with a mix of animation and live action, producing the four-minute short *[The Alphabet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alphabet_\(film\) "The Alphabet (film)")* (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the alphabet to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [Uher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uher_\(brand\) "Uher (brand)") tape recorder to record the sound of Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch found particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch said, "Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started 'The Alphabet' going. The rest of it was just subconscious." [^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 15–16">: 15–16 </span></sup>  [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 39–40">: 39–40 </span></sup> 

Learning about the newly founded [American Film Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute"), which gave grants to filmmakers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to submit a copy of *The Alphabet* along with a script he had written for a new short film, *[The Grandmother](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Short_Films_of_David_Lynch#The_Grandmother "The Short Films of David Lynch")*, that would be almost entirely live action.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 42">: 42 </span></sup>  The institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5,000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 44–47">: 44–47 </span></sup>  *The Grandmother* featured a neglected boy who "grows" a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics [Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Le_Blanc_and_Colin_Odell "Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell") wrote, "this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium".[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 18">: 18 </span></sup>

Lynch left the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts after three semesters and in 1970 moved with his wife and daughter to Los Angeles,[^22] [^23] where he began studying filmmaking at the [AFI Conservatory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Conservatory "AFI Conservatory"), a place he later called "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 57–58">: 57–58 </span></sup>  He began writing a script for a proposed work, *Gardenback*, that had "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, which he reluctantly agreed to do. All the interference on his *Gardenback* project made him fed up with the Conservatory and led him to quit after returning to start his second year and being put in first-year classes. AFI dean [Frank Daniel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Daniel "Frank Daniel") asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create a project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that *Gardenback* was "wrecked", he set out on a new film, *[Eraserhead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead "Eraserhead")*.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 58–59">: 58–59 </span></sup> 

*Eraserhead* was planned to be about 42 minutes long (it ended up being 89 minutes), its script was only 21 pages, and Lynch was able to create the film without interference. He recalled its origin: "My original image was of a man's head bouncing on the ground, being picked up by a boy and taken to a pencil factory. I don’t know where it came from." [^10] Filming began on May 29, 1972, at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team (which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [Sissy Spacek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy_Spacek "Sissy Spacek"), [Jack Fisk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Fisk "Jack Fisk"), cinematographer [Frederick Elmes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Elmes "Frederick Elmes"), and sound designer [Alan Splet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Splet "Alan Splet")) to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets, as well as a food room and a bathroom.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 59–60">: 59–60 </span></sup>  The [AFI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the film, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film *[Easy Rider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider "Easy Rider")*, it was unable to give him more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father and money that he earned from a paper route that he took up, delivering *[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")*.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 60, 76">: 60, 76 </span></sup>  [^24] Not long into *Eraserhead* ' s production, Lynch and Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch married Jack Fisk's sister Mary Fisk.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 60, 80, 110">: 60, 80, 110 </span></sup>  In 1973, Lynch's sister suggested he try [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation "Transcendental Meditation"). It proved a revelation, and Lynch claimed "to never have missed a session since: twenty minutes, twice a day." [^15]<sup><span title="Page / location: 2–3">: 2–3 </span></sup> 

Due to financial problems, the filming of *Eraserhead* was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. During one such break in 1974, Lynch made *The Amputee*, a one-shot film about two minutes long. He proposed that he make *The Amputee* to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 28–29">: 28–29 </span></sup> 

*Eraserhead* was finally finished in 1976. Lynch said that not a single reviewer of the film understood it as he intended. Filmed in black and white, *Eraserhead* tells the story of Henry ([Jack Nance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nance "Jack Nance")), a quiet young man, living in a [dystopian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia "Dystopia") industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. It was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and Lynch has called it "my *[Philadelphia Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Story_\(film\) "The Philadelphia Story (film)")* ".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 56">: 56 </span></sup>  [^25] Lynch tried to get it entered into the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival"), but while some reviewers liked it, others felt it was awful, and it was not selected for screening. Reviewers from the [New York Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Festival "New York Film Festival") also rejected it, but it screened at the [Los Angeles Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Film_Festival "Los Angeles Film Festival"), where [Ben Barenholtz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Barenholtz "Ben Barenholtz"), the distributor of the [Elgin Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Theater "Elgin Theater"), heard about it.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 82–83">: 82–83 </span></sup>  Barenholtz was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977. *Eraserhead* subsequently became popular on the [midnight movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_movie "Midnight movie") underground circuit,[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 54">: 54 </span></sup>  and was later called one of the most important midnight movies of the 1970s, along with *[Night of the Living Dead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead "Night of the Living Dead")*, *[El Topo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Topo "El Topo")*, *[Pink Flamingos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Flamingos "Pink Flamingos")*, *[The Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show "The Rocky Horror Picture Show")*, and *[The Harder They Come](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harder_They_Come "The Harder They Come")*.[^26] [Stanley Kubrick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick "Stanley Kubrick") said it was one of his all-time favorite films.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 77">: 77 </span></sup> 

After *Eraserhead* ' s success on the underground circuit, [Stuart Cornfeld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Cornfeld "Stuart Cornfeld"), an executive producer for [Mel Brooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks "Mel Brooks"), saw it and recalled, "I was just 100 percent blown away... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 88">: 88 </span></sup>  Brooks viewed *Eraserhead*, and after coming out of the screening theater, embraced Lynch, declaring, "You're a madman! I love you! You're in." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 92–93">: 92–93 </span></sup> 

Cornfeld agreed to help Lynch with his next film, *[Ronnie Rocket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Rocket "Ronnie Rocket")*, for which Lynch had already written a script. But Lynch soon realized that *Ronnie Rocket*, a film that he said is about "electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair", was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script by someone else that he could direct. Cornfeld found four. On hearing the title of the first, *The Elephant Man*, Lynch chose it.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 90–92">: 90–92 </span></sup>  *[The Elephant Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Man_\(1980_film\) "The Elephant Man (1980 film)")* ' s script, by Chris de Vore and [Eric Bergren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bergren "Eric Bergren"), is based on the true story of [Joseph Merrick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick "Joseph Merrick"), a severely deformed man in [Victorian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era") London, who was held in a [sideshow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideshow "Sideshow") but later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [Frederick Treves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Frederick_Treves,_1st_Baronet "Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet"). Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would deviate from real events but in his view make a better plot,[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 95">: 95 </span></sup>  but he needed the permission of Brooks, whose company, [Brooksfilms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooksfilms "Brooksfilms"), was responsible for production. The film stars [John Hurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hurt "John Hurt") as John Merrick (the name changed from Joseph) and [Anthony Hopkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins "Anthony Hopkins") as Treves. Filming took place in London. Though surrealistic and in black and white, it has been called "one of the most conventional" of Lynch's films.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 29–30">: 29–30 </span></sup>  It was a critical and commercial success, earning eight [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") nominations, including [Best Director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "Academy Award for Best Director") and [Best Adapted Screenplay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay").[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 104">: 104 </span></sup> 

After *The Elephant Man* ' s success, [George Lucas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas "George Lucas"), a fan of *Eraserhead*, offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his original *[Star Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars")* trilogy, *[Return of the Jedi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi "Return of the Jedi")*. Lynch declined, saying that he had "next door to zero interest" and arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's.[^27] [^25] [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 113">: 113 </span></sup>  Soon, the opportunity to direct another big-budget science fiction epic arose when [Dino de Laurentiis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_de_Laurentiis "Dino de Laurentiis") of the [De Laurentiis Entertainment Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laurentiis_Entertainment_Group "De Laurentiis Entertainment Group") asked Lynch to create a film adaptation of [Frank Herbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert "Frank Herbert") 's science fiction novel [*Dune*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(novel\) "Dune (novel)") (1965).[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 113">: 113 </span></sup>  Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He began writing a script based on the novel, initially with both de Vore and Bergren, and then alone when De Laurentiis was unhappy with their ideas.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 115">: 115 </span></sup>  Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create "a certain look", and particularly enjoyed building the set for the oil planet [Giedi Prime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giedi_Prime "Giedi Prime"), for which he used "steel, bolts, and porcelain".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 118">: 118 </span></sup> 

*Dune* is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a [feudal system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism"). The main character, [Paul Atreides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Atreides "Paul Atreides") ([Kyle MacLachlan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_MacLachlan "Kyle MacLachlan")), is the son of a nobleman who takes control of the [desert planet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_planet "Desert planet") [Arrakis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrakis "Arrakis"), which grows the rare spice [melange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melange_\(fictional_drug\) "Melange (fictional drug)"), the empire's most highly prized commodity. Lynch was unhappy with the work, later saying: " *Dune* was a kind of studio film. I didn't have [final cut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_cut_privilege "Final cut privilege"). And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 120">: 120 </span></sup>  Much of his footage was removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 116–117">: 116–117 </span></sup>  Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as *Star Wars*, *[Dune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(1984_film\) "Dune (1984 film)")* (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45 million to make, and grossed $27.4 million domestically. Later, [Universal Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures "Universal Pictures") released an "extended cut" for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. It did not represent Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original version. Lynch objected to the changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has [Alan Smithee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Smithee "Alan Smithee") credited as the director and "Judas Booth" (a pseudonym Lynch invented, reflecting his feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.[^28]

[Isabella Rossellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Rossellini "Isabella Rossellini") and [Kyle MacLachlan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_MacLachlan "Kyle MacLachlan") in a publicity still for *[Blue Velvet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_\(film\) "Blue Velvet (film)")* (1986).

Lynch was still contractually obligated to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis, the first a planned sequel to *Dune*, which due to the film's failure never went beyond the script stage.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 115">: 115 </span></sup>  The other was a more personal work, based on a script Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, *[Blue Velvet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_\(film\) "Blue Velvet (film)")* was set in [Lumberton, North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumberton,_North_Carolina "Lumberton, North Carolina"), and revolves around a college student, Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan), who finds a severed ear in a field. Investigating with the help of his friend Sandy ([Laura Dern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Dern "Laura Dern")), Jeffrey discovers a criminal gang led by psychopath [Frank Booth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Booth_\(Blue_Velvet\) "Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)") ([Dennis Hopper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper "Dennis Hopper")), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([Isabella Rossellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Rossellini "Isabella Rossellini")) and repeatedly rapes her. Lynch called the story "a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 138">: 138 </span></sup>  Lynch included 1960s pop songs, including [Roy Orbison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Orbison "Roy Orbison") 's " [In Dreams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Dreams_\(Roy_Orbison_song\) "In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)") " and [Bobby Vinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Vinton "Bobby Vinton") 's " [Blue Velvet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_\(song\) "Blue Velvet (song)") ", the latter of which largely inspired the film. Lynch said, "It was the song that sparked the movie... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were lawns—lawns and the neighborhood." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 134">: 134 </span></sup>  Other music for the film is by [Angelo Badalamenti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Badalamenti "Angelo Badalamenti"), who scored most of Lynch's subsequent work.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 130–132">: 130–132 </span></sup> 

De Laurentiis loved the film, and it received support at some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to mainstream audiences were very poorly received.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 148–149">: 148–149 </span></sup>  The film was controversial; [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") wrote that Rossellini "is asked to do things in this film that require real nerve… She is degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera." Rossellini responded: "I was an adult. I was 31 or 32. I chose to play the character... I think my character was the first time we did an abused woman, a portrait of an abused woman, but also she camouflaged herself behind what she was asked to be, which was sexy and beautiful and singing, and she obeys the order, and is also victimized it. That’s the complexity of *Blue Velvet* but also the great talent of David Lynch. I thought he did a fantastic film. I love *Blue Velvet*." [^29] *Blue Velvet* was a critical and commercial success, winning the [National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society_of_Film_Critics_Award_for_Best_Film "National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film") and earning Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. [David Thomson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_\(film_critic\) "David Thomson (film critic)") recalls seeing it for the first time: "The occasion stood as the last moment of transcendence I had felt at the movies—until *[The Piano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piano "The Piano")*. What I mean by that is a kind of passionate involvement with both the story and the making of a film, so that I was simultaneously moved by the enactment on the screen and by discovering that a new director had made the medium alive and dangerous again." [^16] [Pauline Kael](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael "Pauline Kael") praised Lynch as a "genius naïf" and predicted that he "might turn out to be the first populist surrealist—a [Frank Capra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra "Frank Capra") of dream logic." She quoted a moviegoer as saying "Maybe I’m sick, but I want to see that again." [^30]

Lynch at the [1990 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Cannes_Film_Festival "1990 Cannes Film Festival")

Lynch met the television producer [Mark Frost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Frost "Mark Frost") and they started working together on a biopic of [Marilyn Monroe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe "Marilyn Monroe") based on [Anthony Summers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Summers "Anthony Summers") 's book *The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe*, but it never got off the ground.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 156–157">: 156–157 </span></sup>  [^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 85">: 85 </span></sup>  While talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on a lakeshore, and went to work on their third project, first called *Northwest Passage* and then *[Twin Peaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks "Twin Peaks")* (1990–91).[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 157">: 157 </span></sup>  A drama set in an eponymous small [Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_\(state\) "Washington (state)") town where popular high school student [Laura Palmer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Palmer "Laura Palmer") ([Sheryl Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Lee "Sheryl Lee")) has been murdered, *Twin Peaks* featured [FBI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI") [Special Agent Dale Cooper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Cooper "Dale Cooper") (MacLachlan) as the investigator trying to identify the killer, and discovering many of the townsfolk's secrets; Lynch said, "The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters." He later said, "\[Mark Frost and I\] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart." They pitched the series to [ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company"), which agreed to finance the pilot and eventually commissioned a season comprising seven episodes.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 157–159">: 157–159 </span></sup>  [Richard Corliss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Corliss "Richard Corliss") wrote: "Long before the series' April premiere, ecstatic critics were priming TV viewers to expect the unexpected. Lynch's two-hour pilot didn't disappoint. It was frantic and lugubrious in turn, a soap opera with strychnine. In one night, the show had hip America hooked." [^10]

Lynch directed two of the first season's seven episodes and carefully chose the other episodes' directors.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 174–175">: 174–175 </span></sup>  He also appeared in several episodes as FBI agent [Gordon Cole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cole_\(Twin_Peaks\) "Gordon Cole (Twin Peaks)"). The series was a success, with high ratings in the U.S. and many other countries, and soon had a cult following. A second season of 22 episodes went into production, but ABC executives believed that public interest in the show was declining. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal Laura's killer's identity prematurely, which Lynch grudgingly agreed to do,[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 180–181">: 180–181 </span></sup>  in what Lynch called one of his biggest professional regrets.[^31] After identifying the murderer and moving from Thursday to Saturday night, *Twin Peaks* continued for several more episodes, but was canceled after a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that writers and directors took in the later episodes, directed the final episode. He ended it with a [cliffhanger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger "Cliffhanger") (like season one had), later saying, "that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 182">: 182 </span></sup> 

Meanwhile, he was also involved in creating various commercials for companies including [Yves Saint Laurent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_\(brand\) "Yves Saint Laurent (brand)"), [Calvin Klein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein "Calvin Klein"), [Giorgio Armani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani "Giorgio Armani"), and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching Twin Peaks for his missing wife.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 211–212">: 211–212 </span></sup> 

> 1990 was Lynch's annus mirabilis: *Wild at Heart* won the [Palme d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at [Cannes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes "Cannes"), and the television series *Twin Peaks* was proving a smash hit with audiences across the world. The musical/performance piece *Industrial Symphony No. 1*, which Lynch had staged with Angelo Badalamenti at the Brooklyn Academy of music, had spawned the album *Floating into the Night* and launched singer [Julee Cruise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julee_Cruise "Julee Cruise"). Five one-man exhibitions between 1989 and 1991 emphasized Lynch's roots in fine art and painting, and a rash of ads (including a teaser trailer for [Michael Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson "Michael Jackson") 's 'Dangerous' tour) confirmed the demand for the Lynch touch... In an unlikely scenario for the maker of *Eraserhead*, Lynch had become an influential and fashionable brand name.

—Christopher Rodley [^8]<sup><span title="Page: 191">: 191 </span></sup> 

While Lynch was working on the first few episodes of *Twin Peaks*, his friend [Monty Montgomery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Montgomery_\(producer\) "Monty Montgomery (producer)") "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be executive producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." The book was [Barry Gifford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Gifford "Barry Gifford") 's novel *[Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_at_Heart_\(novel\) "Wild at Heart (novel)")*, about two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 193">: 193 </span></sup>  With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into *[Wild at Heart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_at_Heart_\(film\) "Wild at Heart (film)")*, a [crime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction "Crime fiction") and [road movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_movie "Road movie") starring [Nicolas Cage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage "Nicolas Cage") as Sailor and [Laura Dern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Dern "Laura Dern") as Lula.[^32] Calling its plot a "strange blend" of "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch departed substantially from the novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to *[The Wizard of Oz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz "The Wizard of Oz")*.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 193–194, 198">: 193–194, 198 </span></sup>  Corliss wrote: " *Wild at Heart*, which sends a pair of loser lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) on a trip into the dark night of the [Southern Gothic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic "Southern Gothic") soul, is a tonic for the senses and an assault on the sensibilities. Heads splatter, skulls explode, biker punks torture folks for the sheer heck of it, and a pair of loopy innocents find excitement in a side trip to hell. Pretty much like *Blue Velvet*. Yes, it's different, but the same kind of different; Lynch could no longer shock by being shocking. Many critics figured they had solved the mystery of his visual style and thematic preoccupations. Next mystery, please. By August, when the film opened in the U.S., the Lynch mob was more like a lynch mob." [^10] Despite a muted response from American critics and viewers, *Wild at Heart* won the [Palme d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at the [1990 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Cannes_Film_Festival "1990 Cannes Film Festival").[^33] When it won the prize, audience members booed Lynch and the film.[^34]

After *Wild at Heart* ' s success, Lynch returned to the world of the canceled *Twin Peaks*, this time without Frost, to make a film that was primarily a prequel but also in part a sequel. Lynch said, "I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 187">: 187 </span></sup>  The result, *[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks:_Fire_Walk_with_Me "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me")* (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days of Laura Palmer's life, was much "darker" in tone than the TV series, with much of the humor removed, and dealt with such topics as [incest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest "Incest") and murder. Lynch has said the film is about "the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest". The company CIBY-2000 financed *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*, and most of the TV series's cast reprised their roles, though some refused and many were unenthusiastic about the project.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 184–187">: 184–187 </span></sup>  The film was a commercial failure in the U.S. at the time of its release, but has since experienced a critical reappraisal. Many critics, such as [Mark Kermode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kermode "Mark Kermode"), have called it Lynch's "masterpiece".[^35]

Meanwhile, Lynch worked on some new television shows. He and Frost created the comedy series *[On the Air](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Air_\(TV_series\) "On the Air (TV series)")* (1992), which was canceled after three episodes aired, and he and Montgomery created the three-episode [HBO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") [miniseries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries "Miniseries") *[Hotel Room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Room "Hotel Room")* (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room on different dates.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 82–84">: 82–84 </span></sup> 

In 1993, Lynch collaborated with Japanese musician [Yoshiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiki_\(musician\) "Yoshiki (musician)") on the video for [X Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Japan "X Japan") 's song " [Longing ~Setsubou no Yoru~](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longing_\(song\) "Longing (song)") ". The video was never officially released, but Lynch wrote in his 2018 memoir *Room to Dream* that "some of the frames are so fuckin' beautiful, you can't believe it." [^36]

After his unsuccessful TV ventures, Lynch returned to film. In 1997, he released the non-linear [noiresque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir") *[Lost Highway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_\(film\) "Lost Highway (film)")*, which was co-written by Barry Gifford and stars [Bill Pullman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pullman "Bill Pullman") and [Patricia Arquette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Arquette "Patricia Arquette"). The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.[^37] [^38]

Lynch then began work on a film from a script by [Mary Sweeney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sweeney "Mary Sweeney") and John E. Roach, *[The Straight Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straight_Story "The Straight Story")*, based on the true story of [Alvin Straight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Straight "Alvin Straight") ([Richard Farnsworth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Farnsworth "Richard Farnsworth")), an elderly man from [Laurens, Iowa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurens,_Iowa "Laurens, Iowa"), who goes on a 300-mile journey to visit his sick brother ([Harry Dean Stanton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton "Harry Dean Stanton")) in [Mount Zion, Wisconsin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Zion,_Wisconsin "Mount Zion, Wisconsin"), by [riding lawnmower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_mower "Riding mower"). Asked why he chose this script, Lynch said, "that's what I fell in love with next", and expressed his admiration of Straight, describing him as "like [James Dean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean "James Dean"), except he's old".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 247, 252">: 247, 252 </span></sup>  Badalamenti scored the film, calling it "very different from the kind of score he's done for \[Lynch\] in the past".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 260">: 260 </span></sup> 

Among the many differences from Lynch's other films, *[The Straight Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straight_Story "The Straight Story")* contains no profanity, sex, or violence, and is rated G (general viewing) by the [Motion Picture Association of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America "Motion Picture Association of America"), which came as "shocking news" to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it "did not disturb, offend or mystify".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 245">: 245 </span></sup>  Le Blanc and Odell write that the plot made it "seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film—a surreal road movie".[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 69">: 69 </span></sup>  It was also Lynch's only title released by [Walt Disney Pictures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures "Walt Disney Pictures") in the U.S., after studio president [Peter Schneider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schneider_\(film_executive\) "Peter Schneider (film executive)") screened the film before its Cannes Film Festival premiere and quickly had Disney acquire the distribution rights. Schneider said it is "a beautiful movie about values, forgiveness and healing and celebrates America. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a Walt Disney film." [^39] It was named one of the best films of the year by *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")*; [Janet Maslin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin "Janet Maslin") wrote: "Somehow it took David Lynch to lead audiences past the ultimate frontier: into a G-rated parable of spirituality and decency, seen from the unfashionable vantage point of old age. Mr. Lynch accomplished the unthinkable by putting Richard Farnsworth, in a devastatingly real and rock-solid performance, on a lawnmower at five miles per hour and still building enough drama and emotion for a great chase. Burned out on the surreal and the grotesque, Mr. Lynch faced down inevitable realities about aging and conscience." [^40]

Lynch (second from left) at the [2001 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Cannes_Film_Festival "2001 Cannes Film Festival") promoting *[Mulholland Drive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_\(film\) "Mulholland Drive (film)")*

In 1999, Lynch approached [ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company") again with ideas for a television drama. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series *Mulholland Drive*, but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. With $7 million from the French [production company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company "Production company") [StudioCanal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/StudioCanal "StudioCanal"), Lynch completed the pilot as a film, *[Mulholland Drive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_\(film\) "Mulholland Drive (film)")*. The film, a nonlinear surrealist tale of [Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States "Cinema of the United States") 's dark side, stars [Naomi Watts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Watts "Naomi Watts"), [Laura Harring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Harring "Laura Harring"), and [Justin Theroux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Theroux "Justin Theroux"). It performed relatively well at the box office worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch [Best Director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival_Award_for_Best_Director "Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director") at the [2001 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Cannes_Film_Festival "2001 Cannes Film Festival") (shared with [Joel Coen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers "Coen brothers") for *[The Man Who Wasn't There](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Wasn%27t_There_\(2001_film\) "The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)")*) and Best Director from the New York Film Critics Association. He also received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director.[^41] In 2016, the film was named the [best film of the 21st century in a BBC poll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC%27s_100_Greatest_Films_of_the_21st_Century "BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century") of 177 film critics from 36 countries.[^42] [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert"), who had dismissed much of Lynch's earlier work, wrote: "At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [^43]

With the rising popularity of the Internet, Lynch decided to use it as a distribution channel, releasing several new series he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com, which went online on December 10, 2001.[^44] In 2002, he created a series of online shorts, *[DumbLand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DumbLand "DumbLand")*. Intentionally crude in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD.[^45] The same year, Lynch released a surreal sitcom, *[Rabbits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_\(film\) "Rabbits (film)")*, about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with [Digital Video](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV_\(video_format\) "DV (video format)") available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short *[Darkened Room](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkened_Room "Darkened Room")*. In 2006, Lynch's feature film *[Inland Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire_\(film\) "Inland Empire (film)")* was released. At three hours, it is his longest film. Like *Mulholland Drive* and *Lost Highway*, it lacks a traditional narrative structure. It stars [Laura Dern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Dern "Laura Dern"), [Harry Dean Stanton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton "Harry Dean Stanton"), and [Justin Theroux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Theroux "Justin Theroux"), with cameos by [Naomi Watts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Watts "Naomi Watts") and [Laura Harring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Harring "Laura Harring") as the voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit, and a performance by [Jeremy Irons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Irons "Jeremy Irons"). Lynch called *Inland Empire* "a mystery about a woman in trouble". In an effort to promote it, he made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan "Without cheese there would be no *Inland Empire* ".[^46]

Lynch in Moscow in 2009

In 2009, Lynch produced a documentary Web series directed by his son Austin Lynch and friend Jason S., *Interview Project*.[^47] Interested in working with [Werner Herzog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog "Werner Herzog"), in 2009 Lynch collaborated on Herzog's film *[My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Son,_My_Son,_What_Have_Ye_Done "My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done")*. With a nonstandard narrative, the film is based on a true story of an actor who committed [matricide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricide "Matricide") while acting in a production of the *[Oresteia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oresteia "Oresteia")*, and stars [Grace Zabriskie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Zabriskie "Grace Zabriskie").[^48] In 2009, Lynch had plans to direct a documentary on [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi") consisting of interviews with people who knew him,[^49] but nothing came of it.

In 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the *[Family Guy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy "Family Guy")* spin-off *[The Cleveland Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cleveland_Show "The Cleveland Show")* as [Gus the Bartender](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Family_Guy_franchise#Stoolbend_residents "List of characters in the Family Guy franchise"). He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, [Mike Henry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Henry_\(voice_actor\) "Mike Henry (voice actor)"), a fan of Lynch who felt that his life had changed after he saw *Wild at Heart*.[^50] *[Lady Blue Shanghai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Blue_Shanghai "Lady Blue Shanghai")* is a 16-minute promotional film written, directed and edited by Lynch for [Dior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior "Dior"). It was released on the Internet in May 2010.[^51]

Lynch directed a concert by English [new wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music "New wave music") band [Duran Duran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duran_Duran "Duran Duran") on March 23, 2011. The concert was [streamed live](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media") on YouTube from the [Mayan Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_Theater "Mayan Theater") in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of *[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstaged "Unstaged")*. "The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage", Lynch said. "A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents".[^52] The animated short *I Touch a Red Button Man*, a collaboration between Lynch and the band [Interpol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_\(band\) "Interpol (band)"), played in the background during Interpol's concert at the [Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella "Coachella") in April 2011. The short, which features Interpol's song "Lights", was later made available online.[^53]

Lynch (left) with [Kyle MacLachlan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_MacLachlan "Kyle MacLachlan") at the 2017 premiere of [*Twin Peaks* ' s third season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks_season_3 "Twin Peaks season 3")

It was believed that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to [Abel Ferrara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Ferrara "Abel Ferrara"), Lynch "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've talked to him about it, OK? I can tell when he talks about it." [^54] But in a June 2012 interview, Lynch said he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but "If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow".[^55] In September 2012, he appeared in the three-part "Late Show" arc on FX's *[Louie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_\(American_TV_series\) "Louie (American TV series)")* as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending [Plus Camerimage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camerimage "Camerimage") in [Bydgoszcz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bydgoszcz "Bydgoszcz"), Poland, saying, "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when".[^56] At Plus Camerimage, Lynch received a lifetime achievement award and the [Key to the City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City#Key_to_the_city "Freedom of the City") from Bydgoszcz's mayor, [Rafał Bruski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafa%C5%82_Bruski "Rafał Bruski").[^57] In a January 2013 interview, Laura Dern confirmed that she and Lynch were planning a new project,[^58] [^59] and *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* later reported that Lynch was working on the script.[^60] *[Idem Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idem_Paris "Idem Paris")*, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013.[^61] On June 28, 2013, a video Lynch directed for the [Nine Inch Nails](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails "Nine Inch Nails") song " [Came Back Haunted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Came_Back_Haunted "Came Back Haunted") " was released.[^62] He also did photography for the [Dumb Numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_Numbers "Dumb Numbers") 's self-titled album released in August 2013.[^63]

On October 6, 2014, Lynch confirmed via Twitter that he and Frost would start shooting a new, nine-episode season of *[Twin Peaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks_season_3 "Twin Peaks season 3")* in 2015, with the episodes expected to air in 2016 on [Showtime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_\(TV_network\) "Showtime (TV network)").[^64] Lynch and Frost wrote all the episodes. On April 5, 2015, Lynch announced via Twitter that the project was still alive, but he was no longer going to direct because the budget was too low for what he wanted to do.[^65] On May 15, 2015, he said via Twitter that he would return to the revival, having sorted out his issues with Showtime.[^66] Showtime CEO David Nevins confirmed this, announcing that Lynch would direct every episode of the revival and that the original nine episodes had been extended to 18.[^67] Filming was completed by April 2016.[^68] [^69] The two-episode premiere aired on May 21, 2017.[^70]

Lynch attending the [2017 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Cannes_Film_Festival "2017 Cannes Film Festival")

While doing press for *Twin Peaks*, Lynch was again asked if he had retired from film and seemed to confirm that he had made his last feature film, responding, "Things changed a lot... So many films were not doing well at the box office, even though they might have been great films and the things that were doing well at the box office weren't the things that I would want to do".[^71] Lynch later said that this statement had been misconstrued: "I did not say I quit cinema, simply that nobody knows what the future holds." [^72]

Lynch did weather reports on his now-defunct website in the 2000s.[^73] He returned to doing weather reports in 2020 from his apartment in Los Angeles, along with two new series, *What is David Lynch Working on Today?*, which detailed him making collages, and *Today's Number Is...*, in which he picked a random number from 1 to 10 each day from a jar containing ten numbered ping-pong balls. In one of his weather reports, Lynch detailed a dream he had about being a German soldier shot by an American soldier on [D-Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Day "D-Day").[^74] [^75] Most of his Weather Reports featured Lynch saying he was "thinking about" songs, including songs by [The Beatles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles "The Beatles"), [The Rolling Stones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones "The Rolling Stones"), [The Everly Brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Everly_Brothers "The Everly Brothers"), and [The Platters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platters "The Platters"). After his final weather report on December 16, 2022, Lynch said in an April 2023 interview that the series, along with *What is David Lynch Working on Today?* and *Today's Number Is...*, would not return, adding: "Now I can sleep longer in the morning. I had to get up very early to consult the real weather bulletin. In two years I have not missed a single one." [^76]

Lynch portrayed director [John Ford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford "John Ford") *(pictured, 1973)* in [Steven Spielberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg "Steven Spielberg") 's *[The Fabelmans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans "The Fabelmans")* (2022).

In June 2020, Lynch rereleased his 2002 web series *[Rabbits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_\(film\) "Rabbits (film)")* on YouTube.[^77] [^78] On July 17, 2020, his store for merchandise released a set of face masks with Lynch's art on them for the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States "COVID-19 pandemic in the United States").[^79] In February 2022, it was announced that Lynch had been cast in [Steven Spielberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg "Steven Spielberg") 's semi-autobiographical film *[The Fabelmans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans "The Fabelmans")* in a role *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* called "a closely guarded secret". Lynch played [John Ford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford "John Ford"), whom the young Spielberg met, an encounter Spielberg considers formative. [Gabriel LaBelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_LaBelle "Gabriel LaBelle") played Spielberg's alter ego [Sammy Fabelman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Fabelman "Sammy Fabelman"), and Lynch as Ford offers the young man advice on filmmaking.[^80] Lynch and the cast were nominated for the [Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award_for_Outstanding_Performance_by_a_Cast_in_a_Motion_Picture "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture").[^81] [J. Hoberman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hoberman "J. Hoberman") wrote: "Mr. Lynch never made a conventional, crowd-pleasing Hollywood movie. But in 2022, he agreed to a cameo in one: Mr. Spielberg's autobiographical feature *The Fabelmans*, where the enigmatic if not eldritch Mr. Lynch was cast as John Ford, the maker of westerns and the grand old curmudgeon of American cinema. It was a sentimental gesture that one can only call Lynchian." [^19]

Lynch worked on a number of projects that never progressed beyond the [pre-production](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-production "Pre-production") stage. Some of them fell into [development hell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell "Development hell") and others were officially canceled.[^82] [^83] [^84]

In 1983, Lynch began writing and drawing a [comic strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strip "Comic strip"), *[The Angriest Dog in the World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angriest_Dog_in_the_World "The Angriest Dog in the World")*, that featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog so angry it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It was published from 1983 to 1992 in *[The Village Voice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice "The Village Voice")*, *[Creative Loafing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Loafing "Creative Loafing")*, and other tabloid and alternative publications.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 109">: 109 </span></sup>  Around this time Lynch also became interested in photography and traveled to northern England to photograph its degrading industrial landscape.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 109–111">: 109–111 </span></sup> 

Lynch directed a short film, *[The Cowboy and the Frenchman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowboy_and_the_Frenchman "The Cowboy and the Frenchman")* (1988), as part of *[The French as Seen by...](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_as_Seen_by... "The French as Seen by...")*, a series sponsored by the French newspaper *[Le Figaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Figaro "Le Figaro")*. The other directors commissioned for the series were [Werner Herzog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog "Werner Herzog"), [Andrzej Wajda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda "Andrzej Wajda"), [Luigi Comencini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Comencini "Luigi Comencini"), and [Jean-Luc Godard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard "Jean-Luc Godard").

While *Twin Peaks* was in production, the [Brooklyn Academy of Music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music "Brooklyn Academy of Music") asked Lynch and Badalamenti to create a theatrical piece to be performed twice in 1989 as a part of the [New Music America Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Music_America_Festival "New Music America Festival"). The result was *[Industrial Symphony No. 1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Symphony_No._1 "Industrial Symphony No. 1"): The Dream of the Broken Hearted*, which starred frequent Lynch collaborators [Laura Dern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Dern "Laura Dern"), [Nicolas Cage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage "Nicolas Cage"), and [Michael J. Anderson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Anderson "Michael J. Anderson") and contained five songs sung by [Julee Cruise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julee_Cruise "Julee Cruise"). Lynch produced a 50-minute video of the performance in 1990.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 55–56">: 55–56 </span></sup> 

Lynch painted *So This Is Love* in 1992.

Lynch first trained as a painter, and although better known as a filmmaker, continued to paint. He regarded himself as a visual artist equally at home in painting and cinema.[^85] Throughout his career he lamented what he called the "celebrity painter" problem, which relegated his artwork to the status of a hobby, "like golfing".[^86]

Of his aesthetic and approach, he said: "all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let nature paint more than I paint." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 22">: 22 </span></sup>  Many of his works are very dark in color; Lynch said this was because:

> I wouldn't know what to do with \[color\]. Color to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a color, the more dreamy it gets... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 20">: 20 </span></sup> 

Many of Lynch's paintings contain letters and words. He said:

> The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 22">: 22 </span></sup> 

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [Fondation Cartier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondation_Cartier "Fondation Cartier") in Paris from March 3 to May 27, 2007. The show was titled *The Air is on Fire* and included paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art installations were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events, including live performances and concerts, accompanied the exhibition.[^87] Lynch's alma mater, the [Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Academy_of_the_Fine_Arts "Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts"), presented an exhibition of his work called "The Unified Field", which ran from September 12, 2014, to January 2015.[^88] Lynch was represented by Kayne Griffin Corcoran in Los Angeles, and began exhibiting his paintings, drawings, and photography with the gallery in 2011.[^89]

Lynch considered the 20th-century Irish-born British artist [Francis Bacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_\(artist\) "Francis Bacon (artist)") his "number one kinda hero painter", saying, "Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 16–17">: 16–17 </span></sup>  His favorite photographers included [William Eggleston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eggleston "William Eggleston") (*[The Red Ceiling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Ceiling "The Red Ceiling")*), [Joel-Peter Witkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel-Peter_Witkin "Joel-Peter Witkin") and [Diane Arbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus "Diane Arbus").[^90]

Lynch in 2007

Lynch was involved in several music projects, many of them related to his films, including sound design for some of his films (sometimes alongside collaborators [Alan Splet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Splet "Alan Splet"),[^91] [Dean Hurley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Hurley "Dean Hurley"),[^92] and [Angelo Badalamenti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Badalamenti "Angelo Badalamenti") [^93]). His album genres included [experimental rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_rock "Experimental rock"), [ambient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music "Ambient music") soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde [electropop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropop "Electropop") music. He produced and wrote lyrics for [Julee Cruise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julee_Cruise "Julee Cruise") 's first two albums, *[Floating into the Night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_into_the_Night "Floating into the Night")* (1989) and *[The Voice of Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_of_Love_\(Julee_Cruise_album\) "The Voice of Love (Julee Cruise album)")* (1993), in collaboration with Badalamenti, who wrote the music and also produced. In 1991, Lynch directed a 30-second teaser trailer for [Michael Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson "Michael Jackson") 's album [*Dangerous*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_\(Michael_Jackson_album\) "Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)") at Jackson's request.[^94] He also worked on the 1998 [Jocelyn Montgomery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Montgomery "Jocelyn Montgomery") album *Lux Vivens (Living Light), The Music of Hildegard von Bingen*.[^95] Lynch wrote music for *Wild at Heart*, *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*, *Mulholland Drive*, and *Rabbits*. In 2001, he released *[BlueBob](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueBob "BlueBob")*, a [blues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues") album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style. He plays "upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar", and relies heavily on effects pedals.[^96] Lynch wrote several pieces for *Inland Empire*, including two songs, "Ghost of Love" and "Walkin' on the Sky", in which he made his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his book-CD set *[Dark Night of the Soul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Mouse_and_Sparklehorse_Present:_Dark_Night_of_the_Soul "Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul")* was released.[^97] In 2008, he started his own record label, David Lynch MC, which first released *Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi* in early 2009.[^98]

In November 2010, Lynch released two [electropop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropop "Electropop") music singles, "Good Day Today" and "I Know", on the independent British label [Sunday Best Recordings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Best_\(music_company\) "Sunday Best (music company)"). Of the songs, he said, "I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean \[Hurley\] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that".[^99] The singles were followed by an album, *[Crazy Clown Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Clown_Time "Crazy Clown Time")*, which was released in November 2011 and described as an "electronic blues album".[^100] The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by [Karen O](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_O "Karen O") of the [Yeah Yeah Yeahs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs "Yeah Yeah Yeahs"),[^101] and composed and performed by Lynch and Hurley.[^100] All or most of the songs on *Crazy Clown Time* were put into art-music videos, with Lynch directing the title song's video.[^102] [^103] [^104] [^105]

On September 29, 2011, Lynch released *This Train* with vocalist and longtime musical collaborator [Chrystabell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrystabell "Chrystabell") on the La Rose Noire label.[^106] [^107] Lynch's second studio album, *[The Big Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Dream "The Big Dream")*, was released in 2013 and included the single " [I'm Waiting Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Waiting_Here "I'm Waiting Here") ", with Swedish singer-songwriter [Lykke Li](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lykke_Li "Lykke Li").[^108] *The Big Dream* ' s release was preceded by *TBD716*, an enigmatic 43-second video featured on Lynch's YouTube and [Vine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_\(app\) "Vine (app)") accounts.[^109] For [Record Store Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_Store_Day "Record Store Day") 2014, Lynch released *The Big Dream Remix EP*, which featured four songs from his album remixed by various artists. This included the track "Are You Sure" remixed by the band [Bastille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_\(band\) "Bastille (band)"), which is known to have been inspired by Lynch's work for its songs and videos, especially the song " [Laura Palmer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Palmer_\(song\) "Laura Palmer (song)") ".[^110]

In November 2018, a collaborative album by Lynch and Badalamenti, *[Thought Gang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Gang "Thought Gang")*, was released on vinyl and compact disc. The album was recorded around 1993 but not released at the time. Two tracks from it appear on the soundtrack for *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me* and three others were used for *Twin Peaks: The Return*.[^111] [^112] In May 2019, Lynch provided guest vocals on the track "Fire is Coming" by [Flying Lotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Lotus "Flying Lotus"). He also co-wrote the track that appears on Flying Lotus's album *[Flamagra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamagra "Flamagra")*. A video accompanying the song was released on April 17, 2019.[^113] In May 2021, Lynch produced a track, " [I Am the Shaman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_the_Shaman "I Am the Shaman") ", by Scottish artist [Donovan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan "Donovan"). The song was released on May 10, Donovan's 75th birthday. Lynch also directed the accompanying video.[^114]

In August 2024, Lynch released his final album, *[Cellophane Memories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane_Memories "Cellophane Memories")*, a collaboration between him and Chrystabell. He also directed videos for two tracks on the album, "Sublime Eternal Love" and "The Answers to the Questions".[^115] [^116]

Lynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film *Lost Highway*, including the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case. In April 1997, he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious [Milan Furniture Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Furniture_Fair "Milan Furniture Fair"). "Design and music, art and architecture—they all belong together", he said.[^117]

Working with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia, and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris, Silencio.[^118] It opened in October 2011, and is a private members' club, but is free to the public after midnight. Patrons have access to concerts, films, and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club of the same name in *Mulholland Drive*, the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. "Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to program or create what they want." [^119]

In 2006, Lynch wrote a short book, *[Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_the_Big_Fish "Catching the Big Fish")*, which describes his creative processes, stories from his career, and the benefits he realized from his practice of [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation "Transcendental Meditation"). He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:

> Ideas are like fish.
> 
> If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.
> 
> Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They're huge and abstract. And they're very beautiful.

The book weaves a nonlinear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch's experiences during Transcendental Meditation.[^120] Lynch also narrated it in an audiobook.

Working with [Kristine McKenna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristine_McKenna "Kristine McKenna"), Lynch published a biography-memoir hybrid, *[Room to Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_to_Dream "Room to Dream")*, in June 2018.[^121]

Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posted short videos, his [absurdist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism "Absurdism") series *[Dumbland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbland "Dumbland")*, interviews, and other items. The site also featured a daily [weather report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting") where Lynch gave a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resided. He continued to broadcast this report (usually no longer than 30 seconds) on his personal YouTube channel, *DAVID LYNCH THEATER*, along with "TODAY'S NUMBER", where he drew a random number between one and ten out of a bingo cage.[^122] [^123] Lynch also created a short film, "Rabbits", for his website.[^124]

Lynch was a coffee drinker and had his own line of special organic blends available for purchase on his website and at [Whole Foods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market "Whole Foods Market").[^125] [^126] Called "David Lynch Signature Cup", the coffee has been advertised via flyers included with several Lynch-related DVD releases, including *Inland Empire* and the Gold Box edition of *Twin Peaks*. The brand's tagline is "It's all in the beans... and I'm just full of beans",[^127] [^128] a line [Justin Theroux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Theroux "Justin Theroux") 's character says in *Inland Empire*.[^129]

Lynch with [Isabella Rossellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Rossellini "Isabella Rossellini") at the [1990 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Cannes_Film_Festival "1990 Cannes Film Festival").

Lynch had several long-term relationships. In January 1968, he married Peggy Reavey,[^36] with whom he had one child, [Jennifer Lynch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lynch "Jennifer Lynch"), a film director.[^130] They filed for divorce in 1974.[^131] In June 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, with whom he had one child, Austin Jack Lynch, in 1982.[^132] They separated in 1985 and divorced in 1987.[^131] Lynch had a relationship with actress [Isabella Rossellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Rossellini "Isabella Rossellini") and lived with her between 1986 and 1991. In 1992, he and his editor [Mary Sweeney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sweeney "Mary Sweeney") had a son, Riley Sweeney Lynch.[^133] Sweeney also worked as Lynch's producer and co-wrote and produced *[The Straight Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straight_Story "The Straight Story")*. The two married in May 2006, but filed for divorce that June.[^134] In 2009, Lynch married actress Emily Stofle,[^135] who appeared in his 2006 film *[Inland Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire_\(film\) "Inland Empire (film)")* as well as the [2017 revival of *Twin Peaks*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks_season_3 "Twin Peaks season 3"). The couple had one child, Lula Boginia Lynch, in 2012.[^135] Stofle filed for divorce in 2023. A divorce settlement agreement was reached on December 20, 2024, but the court had not issued a final divorce decree at the time of Lynch's death.

Lynch in 2016

In 2009, Lynch signed a petition in support of director [Roman Polanski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski "Roman Polanski") who, while traveling to a film festival, was detained based on his 1977 arrest for alleged [sexual abuse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case "Roman Polanski sexual abuse case"). The petition argued the arrest would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown "freely and safely", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door "for actions of which no one can know the effects".[^136] [^137]

Lynch said he was "not a political person" and knew little about politics.[^138]<sup><span title="Page / location: 103">: 103 </span></sup>  Describing his political philosophy in 2006, he said, "at that time \[the 1990s\], I thought of myself as a [libertarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism "Libertarianism"). I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [^139] He continued: "I'm a [Democrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I think a lot of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." [^139] He said he voted for [Ronald Reagan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") in the [1984 presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election "1984 United States presidential election"); in the [2000 presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_U.S._presidential_election "2000 U.S. presidential election") he endorsed the [Natural Law Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Law_Party_\(United_States\) "Natural Law Party (United States)"), which advocated [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation "Transcendental Meditation").[^140] [^138] In the [2012 presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_U.S._presidential_election "2012 U.S. presidential election") he said he would vote for Democratic incumbent [Barack Obama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama").[^141]

In the [2016 U.S. presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_U.S._presidential_election "2016 U.S. presidential election"), Lynch endorsed [Bernie Sanders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders"),[^142] whom he described as "for the people".[^143] He voted for Sanders in the [2016 Democratic primaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries "2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries") [^144] and for Libertarian nominee [Gary Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson "Gary Johnson") in the general election.[^145] In a June 2018 interview with *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")*, Lynch said that [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") could go down as "one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the \[country\] so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way." He added: "Our so-called leaders can't take the country forward, can't get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this." [^144] The interviewer clarified that "while Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might." [^144] At a rally later that month, Trump read out sections of the interview, claiming Lynch was a supporter.[^146] Lynch later clarified on Facebook that his words were taken out of context, saying that Trump would "not have a chance to go down in history as a great president" if he continued on the course of "causing suffering and division" and advising him to "treat all the people as you would like to be treated".[^147]

In one of his daily weather report videos in 2020, Lynch expressed support for [Black Lives Matter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter "Black Lives Matter") protests following the [murder of George Floyd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd "Murder of George Floyd").[^148] In a 2022 weather report, he condemned the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine") and addressed Russian president [Vladimir Putin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin") directly, telling him there was "no room for this kind of absurdity anymore" and that Putin would reap what he had sown, lifetime after lifetime.[^149]

Lynch was present with other Boy Scouts outside the [White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") at the [inauguration of President John F. Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy "Inauguration of John F. Kennedy"), which took place on Lynch's 15th birthday.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 5">: 5 </span></sup>  When Kennedy was [assassinated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "Assassination of John F. Kennedy") in 1963, Lynch was the first in his school to hear of it, as he was working on a display case rather than attending class.[^150]

Lynch speaking on [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation "Transcendental Meditation") and the creative process in 2007 [^151]

Lynch advocated Transcendental Meditation as a spiritual practice.[^152] He was initiated into Transcendental Meditation in July 1973, and practiced the technique consistently thereafter.[^153] [^154] Lynch said he met [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi"), the founder of the [TM movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation_movement "Transcendental Meditation movement"), for the first time in 1975 at the [Spiritual Regeneration Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Regeneration_Movement "Spiritual Regeneration Movement") center in Los Angeles.[^155] [^156] He became close with the Maharishi during a month-long "Millionaire's Enlightenment Course" held in 2003, the fee for which was $1 million.[^157]

In July 2005, Lynch launched the [David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and Peace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch_Foundation "David Lynch Foundation"),[^11] [^158] established to help finance scholarships for students in middle and high schools who are interested in learning Transcendental Meditation and to fund research on the technique and its effects on learning. Together with [John Hagelin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hagelin "John Hagelin") and Fred Travis, a brain researcher from [Maharishi University of Management](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_University_of_Management "Maharishi University of Management") (MUM), Lynch promoted his vision on college campuses with a tour that began in September 2005.[^159] Lynch was on MUM's board of trustees [^160] and hosted an annual "David Lynch Weekend for World Peace and Meditation" there, beginning in 2005.[^161] The foundation has also funded meditation lessons for veterans and other "at-risk" populations.[^162]

Lynch was working for the building and establishment of seven buildings in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, "pumping peace for the world". He estimated the cost at US$7 [billion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000 "1,000,000,000"). As of December 2005, he had spent $400,000 of his money and raised $1 million in donations.[^154] In December 2006, *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* reported that he continued to have that goal.[^11] Lynch's book *[Catching the Big Fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_the_Big_Fish "Catching the Big Fish")* (2006) discusses Transcendental Meditation's effect on his creative process. Lynch attended the Maharishi's funeral in India in 2008.[^157] He told a reporter, "In life, he revolutionized the lives of millions of people.... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions of people who will know and understand what the Maharishi has done." [^163] In 2009, Lynch went to India to film interviews with people who knew the Maharishi as part of a biographical documentary.[^164] [^165]

Lynch dedicating his book *Catching the Big Fish* in Paris on the occasion of his World Tour in 2007.

In 2009, Lynch organized a benefit concert at [Radio City Music Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall "Radio City Music Hall") for the David Lynch Foundation. On April 4, 2009, the "Change Begins Within" concert featured [Paul McCartney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney "Paul McCartney"), [Ringo Starr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr "Ringo Starr"), [Donovan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan "Donovan"), [Sheryl Crow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow "Sheryl Crow"), [Eddie Vedder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Vedder "Eddie Vedder"), [Moby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby "Moby"), [Bettye LaVette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettye_LaVette "Bettye LaVette"), [Ben Harper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Harper "Ben Harper"), and [Mike Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Love "Mike Love").[^166] *[David Wants to Fly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wants_to_Fly "David Wants to Fly")* is a 2010 documentary by German filmmaker David Sieveking "that follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM)".[^167] [^168] At the end of the film, Sieveking becomes disillusioned with the TM movement.[^169]

An independent project starring Lynch called *Beyond The Noise: My Transcendental Meditation Journey*, directed by Dana Farley, who has severe dyslexia and attention deficit disorder, was shown at film festivals in 2011,[^170] including the Marbella Film Festival.[^171] Filmmaker [Kevin Sean Michaels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sean_Michaels "Kevin Sean Michaels") is one of the producers.[^172] In 2013, Lynch wrote: "Transcendental Meditation leads to a beautiful, peaceful revolution. A change from suffering and negativity to happiness and a life more and more free of any problems." [^152]

In a 2019 interview by British artist [Alexander de Cadenet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_de_Cadenet "Alexander de Cadenet"), Lynch said: "Here's an experience that utilizes the full brain. That's what it's for. It's for enlightenment, for higher states of consciousness, culminating in the highest state of unity consciousness." [^173] In April 2022, Lynch announced a $500 million transcendental meditation world peace initiative to fund transcendental meditation for 30,000 college students.[^174] In September 2024, Lynch made his last published broadcast speech at Meditate America 2024. He discussed the Beatles' (particularly [John Lennon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon "John Lennon") 's) practice of TM during [their visit to India in 1968](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_in_India "The Beatles in India") and played a cover of " [Across the Universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe "Across the Universe") ".

In August 2024, Lynch said in an interview that he had been diagnosed with [emphysema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema "Emphysema") in 2020 after a lifetime of smoking and had become housebound due to health risks, which he surmised would likely prevent him from directing any new projects.[^175] [^176] Three months later, he told *[People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_\(magazine\) "People (magazine)")* that he had quit smoking in 2022, having started when he was eight years old; he said he was reliant on supplemental oxygen for most daily activities and could "hardly walk across a room".[^177]

Lynch also said he could no longer leave his house, meaning that he would only be able to direct remotely. He said a project for [Netflix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix"), with working titles *Wisteria* and *[Unrecorded Night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch%27s_unrealized_projects#Unrecorded_Night "David Lynch's unrealized projects")*, had fallen through, but that he would like to see his unrealized projects *[Antelope Don't Run No More](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch%27s_unrealized_projects#Antelope_Don't_Run_No_More "David Lynch's unrealized projects")* and *[Snootworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch%27s_unrealized_projects#Snootworld "David Lynch's unrealized projects")* realized.[^178] [^179] Lynch said that month that he was working on existing projects as much as he could, and that he was in good health except for emphysema, and had no plans to retire.[^180]

In January 2025, Lynch was evacuated from his Los Angeles home due to the [Southern California wildfires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2025_Southern_California_wildfires "January 2025 Southern California wildfires"). These events preceded a terminal decline in his health,[^181] and he died at his daughter's home in Los Angeles on January 15, aged 78.[^182] His family posted a message reading:

> There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, "Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole." [^183]

His death certificate, publicly reported in February 2025, concluded that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest, with [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease") cited as the underlying cause. Dehydration was also mentioned as a significant contributor.[^184] The death certificate said he was cremated, with his ashes buried at [Hollywood Forever Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Forever_Cemetery "Hollywood Forever Cemetery").[^185]

Lynch's collaborators [Nicolas Cage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage "Nicolas Cage"), Laura Dern, Kyle MacLachlan, Naomi Watts, and Ray Wise wrote tributes to him.[^186] [^187] MacLachlan honored Lynch with a tribute in *The New York Times.*[^188] He wrote: "I was willing to follow him anywhere because joining him on the journey of discovery, searching and finding together, was the whole point. I stepped out into the unknown because I knew David was floating out there with me... I will miss my dear friend. He has made my world—all of our worlds—both wonderful and strange".[^188] The [WGA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGAw "WGAw") announced that MacLachlan would posthumously give Lynch the [Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Award_for_Screenwriting_Achievement "Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement").[^189]

Steven Spielberg wrote of directing Lynch in *The Fabelmans*: "Here was one of my heroes—David Lynch—playing one of my heroes \[...\] The world is going to miss such an original and unique voice. His films have already stood the test of time and they always will." [^190] [Martin Scorsese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese "Martin Scorsese") wrote a statement that read in part, "He put images on the screen unlike anything that I or anybody else had ever seen—he made everything strange, uncanny, revelatory and new." [^191] Tributes were also paid by [Judd Apatow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Apatow "Judd Apatow"), [Mel Brooks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks "Mel Brooks"), [Francis Ford Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola "Francis Ford Coppola"), [Terry Gilliam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam "Terry Gilliam"), [James Gunn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn "James Gunn"), [Ron Howard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard "Ron Howard"), [Patton Oswalt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_Oswalt "Patton Oswalt"), [Pedro Pascal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal "Pedro Pascal"), [Billy Corgan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Corgan "Billy Corgan"), [Questlove](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questlove "Questlove"), and [Ben Stiller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stiller "Ben Stiller").[^192] [^193]

Critic [Peter Bradshaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bradshaw "Peter Bradshaw") of *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* eulogized Lynch as "the great American [surrealist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist "Surrealist") ".[^194] Critic [Richard Brody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brody "Richard Brody") of *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* wrote, "many films are called revelatory and visionary, but Lynch's films seem made to exemplify these terms", citing his "audacious invention and exquisite realization of symbolic details and uncanny realms".[^195]

Lynch's oft-chosen self-description was "Eagle Scout, Missoula, Montana".[^19]

Soon after Lynch died, fans began placing flowers beneath the "Bob's Big Boy Statue", a statue of [Bob's Big Boy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Big_Boy "Bob's Big Boy") 's titular mascot outside its Burbank location. Lynch was known to enjoy Big Boy's chocolate milkshakes and coffee, and frequented the spot for many years.[^196]

Around the same time, a similar scenario occurred at Twede's Cafe in [North Bend, Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Washington "North Bend, Washington"), the original location of the "Double R Diner" in *Twin Peaks*. As at Big Boy's, flowers, photos, and personal letters were left outside the diner.[^197]

> "An academic definition of Lynchian might be that the term 'refers to a particular kind of irony where the very macabre and the very mundane combine in such a way as to reveal the former's perpetual containment within the latter'".

—Writer [David Foster Wallace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace "David Foster Wallace") in a 1997 article on David Lynch for *[Premiere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_\(magazine\) "Premiere (magazine)")* [^198]

Lynch's distinctive style blends [surrealism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism") with classic [Hollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_film "Hollywood film") storytelling and "pulpy" romanticism,[^199] often employing [experimental filmmaking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_film "Experimental film") techniques alongside elements from commercial genres such as [film noir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir"), [supernatural horror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_horror_film "Supernatural horror film"), [soap opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera "Soap opera"), [camp comedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_\(style\)#Film "Camp (style)"), and [erotic thriller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_thriller "Erotic thriller").[^194] His films have been said to evoke a "dreamlike quality of mystery or menace" through striking visual imagery, and frequently combine "surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments".[^200] Critic [Peter Bradshaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bradshaw "Peter Bradshaw") of *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* called Lynch "the great American surrealist" and described his subversive narratives as "splitting and swirling in [non sequiturs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_\(literary_device\) "Non sequitur (literary device)") and [Escher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher "M. C. Escher") loops".[^194] Film analyst Jennifer Hudson wrote, "Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams".[^201] Ryan Gilbey called Lynch "the greatest cinematic surrealist since [\[Luis\] Buñuel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Bu%C3%B1uel "Luis Buñuel") " and "the most original film-maker to emerge in postwar America".[^202]

[J. Hoberman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hoberman "J. Hoberman") wrote that Lynch's work is characterized by "troubling juxtapositions, outlandish non sequiturs and eroticized derangement of the commonplace".[^19] Hoberman called his approach "more intuitive" than that of his surrealist precursors, and suggested that his art synthesized the disparate styles of Hollywood filmmaker [Frank Capra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra "Frank Capra") and modernist author [Franz Kafka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka "Franz Kafka").[^19] Dennis Lim suggested that Lynch's films "push clichés to their breaking point and find emotion in artifice." [^203] B. Kite of the [BFI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute "British Film Institute") called Lynch's approach "stylised but not mocking", arguing that Lynch was "singularly brave and direct in his approach to heightened emotion" in an era where most filmmakers would opt for ironic distance.[^204] Nick De Semlyen of *[Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Magazine "Empire Magazine")* described his films as moving "back and forth between violent chaos and otherworldly beauty", and suggested that "while other filmmakers tried to wrestle order out of chaos, compacting their stories into neat three-act structures, Lynch revelled in the tumult—that feeling that life is a beautiful, terrifying mystery." [^205]

Lynch's work inspired the use of the adjective "Lynchian" to describe art or situations reminiscent of his style.[^19] Phil Hoad of *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* called the term Lynchian a "go-to adjective to describe any sniff of the [uncanny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny "Uncanny") and esoteric on screen", adding that his "destabilising vision has become a common lens for discerning the truth about the 'normal world'".[^206]

Lynch refused to publicly explain or assign any specific meaning to his works, preferring that viewers interpret them in their own ways.[^207] Asked how audiences should approach his films, he said: "You should not be afraid of using your intuition and feel your way through. Have the experience and trust your inner knowing of what it is." [^208]

> I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. People do strange things constantly, to the point that, for the most part, we manage not to see it. That's why I love coffee shops and public places—I mean, they're all out there.

Many elements recur in Lynch's work; Le Blanc and Odell write, "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas".[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 8">: 8 </span></sup>  Works like *Blue Velvet* and *Twin Peaks* depict stories in which "the folksiness of small town America collided with utter depravity, beset by evils from both sides of the white picket fence", while his later "Hollywood trilogy"— *Lost Highway*, *Mulholland Drive*, and *Inland Empire* —explores "the celluloid dreams of Los Angeles \[against the\] bitter realities and almost cosmic horrors lurking in the hills".[^209] Elements like red theater curtains, diners, dreams, nightclub singers, and [occult-like rituals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism "Occultism") recur frequently in Lynch's work.[^194] Another prominent motif is [industry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory "Factory"), with repeated imagery of "the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories".[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 9–11">: 9–11 </span></sup>  Other imagery common in Lynch's work includes flickering electricity or lights, fire, and stages.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 9–11">: 9–11 </span></sup>  Physical deformity is also found in several of Lynch's films, as is death by head wound. His work frequently depicts a dark, violent criminal underbelly of society, and often contains characters with supernatural or omnipotent qualities.[^210]

In *[The New Yorker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")*, Dennis Lim concluded that "the primal terror of Lynch’s films is an existential one" and that "the volatility of the self and of reality" is central to his work.[^211] Lim wrote that "for Lynch, disruption is generative: [trauma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma "Psychological trauma"), the recurring subject of his films, can rupture the fabric of reality".[^211] Critic [Mark Fisher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher "Mark Fisher") noted that Lynch's works destabilize the hierarchy between distinct levels of reality and fiction:, resulting in a ambiguous [ontological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") situation in which "any apparent reality subsides into a dream".[^212] Kite wrote that "the central mystery" of Lynch's work is rooted in overlapping "worlds" of consciousness and the resultant "perpetual folding between outside and inside".[^204] Gilbey wrote that Lynch's work "exposed the horrors lurking beneath apparently placid exteriors, and found beauty in the quotidian, the industrial" while reflecting a "mix of folksy naivety and elusive strangeness".[^202] Critic Greg Olson wrote that Lynch's work is preoccupied with the "deepest realities" behind surfaces and facades.[^213] Author [David Foster Wallace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace "David Foster Wallace") characterized Lynch's films as deconstructing "the weird irony of the banal".[^198] Lynch's work reflects a preoccupation with the instability of identity, particularly in female characters.[^214] He tended to feature his female leads in "split" roles: many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities.[^215] [^216] Hoberman identified a duality between "exaggerated, even saccharine innocence" and "depraved evil" in his work,[^19] while Lim emphasized that the good and evil in Lynch's art exist in an ambiguous relationship to each other.[^211]

Lynch's affinity for [Eastern spirituality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_spirituality "Eastern spirituality") is evident in his films, though it typically manifests in American trappings.[^217] Joseph Joyce of *Angelus* wrote, "his work could perhaps properly be understood as the marriage between Western kitsch and Eastern spirituality".[^209] According to Kite, much of Lynch's work is underpinned by his [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta") –inspired philosophy, in which the soul is defined by "light and unity" but forgets its original essence, becoming lost in illusions of isolation, violence, and separateness for some time before awaking to remember its true nature.[^204] Kite suggested that Lynch could be understood as "a religious or spiritual artist in a loosely categoric sense", and called his worldview "essentially [monist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism") " but punctuated by superficial [duality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_dualism "Cosmological dualism") and [Gnostic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic "Gnostic") conflict.[^204] Lynch directly invoked the [Vedic scriptures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_scripture "Vedic scripture") known as [the Upanishads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Upanishads "The Upanishads") in several of his films and books; in *Twin Peaks: The Return* and in his live introductions to *Inland Empire*, he quotes a passage from an adapted version of the [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadaranyaka_Upanishad "Brihadaranyaka Upanishad"):[^218]

> We are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe.[^219] [^220]

All but two of Lynch's films are set in the United States, and he frequently referenced 1950s and early 1960s U.S. culture despite his works being set in later decades. Bradshaw wrote, "\[n\]o director ever interpreted the [American Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_dream "American dream") with more artless innocence than David Lynch", citing his work's juxtaposition of the safety of "the suburban drive and the picket fence" with "escape, danger, adventure, sex and death".[^194] Joyce wrote, "it's easy to presume that Lynch was cynic. But \[...\] he really did love [Americana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_\(culture\) "Americana (culture)"); blue jeans and slicked hair, [soda fountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_fountain "Soda fountain"), [Roy Orbison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Orbison "Roy Orbison") and, yes, milkshakes".[^209] Lynch said: "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 18">: 18 </span></sup>  Of the 1950s, he said, "It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future." [^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 3–5">: 3–5 </span></sup> 

*[New York Movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Movie "New York Movie")* (1939) by [Edward Hopper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper "Edward Hopper"), one of Lynch's favorite painters.

Lynch felt that his work was more similar to that of European filmmakers than American ones, and said that most films that "get down and thrill your soul" are by European directors.[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 62">: 62 </span></sup>  He expressed admiration for [Federico Fellini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini "Federico Fellini"),[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 62">: 62 </span></sup>  [Ingmar Bergman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman "Ingmar Bergman"), [Werner Herzog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog "Werner Herzog"), [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock "Alfred Hitchcock"),[^221] [Roman Polanski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski "Roman Polanski"), [Jacques Tati](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Tati "Jacques Tati"),[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 62">: 62 </span></sup>  [Stanley Kubrick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick "Stanley Kubrick"), and [Billy Wilder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Wilder "Billy Wilder"). His favorite film, and one he regularly returned to, was [Victor Fleming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Fleming "Victor Fleming") 's *[The Wizard of Oz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz "The Wizard of Oz")*.[^222] He said that Wilder's *[Sunset Boulevard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard_\(film\) "Sunset Boulevard (film)")* (1950) was one of his favorite pictures,[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 71">: 71 </span></sup>  as were "probably all of Bergman’s movies",[^223] Kubrick's *[Lolita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_\(1962_film\) "Lolita (1962 film)")* (1962), Fellini's *[8½](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/8%C2%BD "8½")* (1963), Tati's *[Monsieur Hulot's Holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Hulot%27s_Holiday "Monsieur Hulot's Holiday")* (1953), Hitchcock's *[Rear Window](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_Window "Rear Window")* (1954), and Herzog's *[Stroszek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroszek "Stroszek")* (1977).[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: 21">: 21 </span></sup>  He also cited [Herk Harvey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herk_Harvey "Herk Harvey") 's *[Carnival of Souls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Souls "Carnival of Souls")* (1962) and [Jerzy Skolimowski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Skolimowski "Jerzy Skolimowski") 's *[Deep End](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_End_\(film\) "Deep End (film)")* (1970) as influences on his work.[^224] [Maya Deren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Deren "Maya Deren") 's 1943 experimental film *[Meshes of the Afternoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshes_of_the_Afternoon "Meshes of the Afternoon")* has also been recognized as a possible influence on Lynch.[^214] Some have suggested that Lynch's love of Hitchcock's *[Vertigo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_\(film\) "Vertigo (film)")* influenced his use of dual-identity female roles.[^215] [^216]

[Edward Hopper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper "Edward Hopper") and [Francis Bacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_\(artist\) "Francis Bacon (artist)") were two of Lynch's favorite painters.[^225] Lynch also praised installation artist [Edward Kienholz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kienholz "Edward Kienholz").[^226] Lynch said his favorite books were [Frank Capra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra "Frank Capra") 's *The Name Above the Title*, [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky "Fyodor Dostoyevsky") 's *[Crime and Punishment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment "Crime and Punishment")*, [Robert Henri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Henri "Robert Henri") 's *The Art Spirit*, [Robert Flynn Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Flynn_Johnson "Robert Flynn Johnson") 's *Anonymous Photographs*, and [Franz Kafka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka "Franz Kafka") 's *[The Metamorphosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis "The Metamorphosis")*.[^227]

Lynch was noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions.[^228] He frequently worked with composer Angelo Badalamenti, film editor [Mary Sweeney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sweeney "Mary Sweeney"), casting director [Johanna Ray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Ray "Johanna Ray"), and actors [Harry Dean Stanton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton "Harry Dean Stanton"), Jack Nance, Kyle MacLachlan, Catherine Coulson, Laura Dern, Naomi Watts, Isabella Rossellini, and [Grace Zabriskie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Zabriskie "Grace Zabriskie").

Lynch was often called a "visionary".[^19] [^229] [^230] In 2007, a panel of critics convened by *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* announced that "after all the discussion, no one could fault the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era",[^231] and [AllMovie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllMovie "AllMovie") called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking".[^232] Film critic [Pauline Kael](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael "Pauline Kael") called Lynch "the first populist surrealist".[^8]<sup><span title="Page / location: xi">: xi </span></sup>

Lynch received multiple awards and nominations, including three [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") nominations for [Best Director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "Academy Award for Best Director") and one for [Best Adapted Screenplay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay"). He twice won France's [César Award for Best Foreign Film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Film "César Award for Best Foreign Film"), as well as the [Palme d'Or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") and the [Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lion_for_Lifetime_Achievement "Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement") at the [Venice Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival "Venice Film Festival").
