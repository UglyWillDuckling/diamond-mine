Domain name system

The **Domain Name System** (**DNS**) is a hierarchical and distributed [name service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_service "Name service") that provides a naming system for [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), services, and other resources on the Internet or other [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) networks. It associates various information with *[domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name "Domain name")* ([identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_\(information\) "Identification (information)") [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_\(computer_science\) "String (computer science)")) assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying [network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol "Network protocol").[^1] The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating [authoritative name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritative_name_server "Authoritative name server") for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over [subdomains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain "Subdomain") of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and [fault-tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault-tolerant "Fault-tolerant") service and was designed to avoid a single large central database. In addition, the DNS specifies the technical functionality of the [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model "Database model") service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite").

The Internet maintains two principal [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace "Namespace"), the domain name <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">hierarchy</mark> and the [[IP]] [address spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space").[^rfc781-2] The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") implement the Domain Name System. A [[NS (Name Server)]] is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for start of authority ([SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOA_record "SOA record")), IP addresses ([A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A "List of DNS record types") and [AAAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA_record "AAAA record")), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP "SMTP") [mail exchangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_exchanger "Mail exchanger") (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for [[Reverse DNS lookup]], and [domain name aliases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_alias "Domain name alias") ([[CNAME record|CNAME]]). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC "DNSSEC") records, or for human queries such as *responsible person* (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating [unsolicited email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolicited_email "Unsolicited email") (spam) by storing a [real-time blackhole list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_blackhole_list "Real-time blackhole list") (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the [zone file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file "Zone file"), but other database systems are common.

The Domain Name System originally used the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP) as transport over IP. Reliability, security, and privacy concerns spawned the use of the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP) as well as numerous other protocol developments.

An often-used analogy to explain the DNS is that it serves as the [phone book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory "Telephone directory") for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer [hostnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname "Hostname") into IP addresses. For example, the hostname `www.example.com` within the domain name [example.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example.com "Example.com") translates to the addresses *93.184.216.34* ([IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4")) and *2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946* ([IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 "IPv6")). The DNS can be quickly and transparently updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators ([URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL")) and [e-mail addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_address "E-mail address") without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.

An important and [ubiquitous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing "Ubiquitous computing") function of the DNS is its central role in distributed Internet services such as [cloud services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_service "Cloud service") and [content delivery networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network "Content delivery network").[^3] When a user accesses a distributed Internet service using a URL, the domain name of the [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL") is translated to the IP address of a server that is proximal to the user. The key functionality of the DNS exploited here is that different users can *simultaneously* receive different translations for the *same* domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services.[^4]

The DNS reflects the structure of administrative responsibility on the Internet.[^rfc1035-5] Each subdomain is a [zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone "DNS zone") of administrative autonomy delegated to a manager. For zones operated by a [registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry "Domain name registry"), administrative information is often complemented by the registry's [RDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_Data_Access_Protocol "Registration Data Access Protocol") and [WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS "WHOIS") services. That data can be used to gain insight on, and track responsibility for, a given host on the Internet.[^6]

Using a simpler, more memorable name in place of a host's numerical address dates back to the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET "ARPANET") era. The Stanford Research Institute (now [SRI International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International "SRI International")) maintained a text file named [HOSTS.TXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_\(file\) "Hosts (file)") that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET.[^rfc3467-7][^8] [Elizabeth Feinler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_J._Feinler "Elizabeth J. Feinler") developed and maintained the first ARPANET directory.[^footnoteevans2018112-9][^footnoteevans2018113-10] Maintenance of numerical addresses, called the Assigned Numbers List, was handled by [Jon Postel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel "Jon Postel") at the [University of Southern California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California "University of Southern California")'s [Information Sciences Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sciences_Institute "Information Sciences Institute") (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.[^11]

Addresses were assigned manually. Computers, including their hostnames and addresses, were added to the primary file by contacting the SRI [Network Information Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterNIC "InterNIC") (NIC), directed by Feinler, via [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone "Telephone") during business hours.[^internethalloffame.org-12] Later, Feinler set up a [WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS "WHOIS") directory on a server in the NIC for retrieval of information about resources, contacts, and entities.[^footnoteevans2018119-13] She and her team developed the concept of domains.[^footnoteevans2018119-13] Feinler suggested that domains should be based on the location of the physical address of the computer.[^footnoteevans2018120-14] Computers at educational institutions would have the domain *[edu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.edu ".edu")*, for example.[^footnoteevans2018120%e2%80%93121-15] She and her team managed the Host Naming Registry from 1972 to 1989.[^16]

By the early 1980s, maintaining a single, centralized host table had become slow and unwieldy and the emerging network required an automated naming system to address technical and personnel issues. Postel directed the task of forging a compromise between five competing proposals of solutions to [Paul Mockapetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mockapetris "Paul Mockapetris"). Mockapetris instead created the Domain Name System in 1983 while at the [University of Southern California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California "University of Southern California").[^internethalloffame.org-12][^17]

The [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") published the original specifications in RFC 882 and RFC 883 in November 1983.[^18][^19] These were updated in RFC 973 in January 1986.

In 1984, four [UC Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley") students, Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle, and Songnian Zhou, wrote the first [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") [name server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server "Name server") implementation for the Berkeley Internet Name Domain, commonly referred to as [BIND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND "BIND").[^terry_usenix_2004-20] In 1985, Kevin Dunlap of [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") substantially revised the DNS implementation. [Mike Karels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Karels "Michael J. Karels"), Phil Almquist, and [Paul Vixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie "Paul Vixie") then took over BIND maintenance. [Internet Systems Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Systems_Consortium "Internet Systems Consortium") was founded in 1994 by [Rick Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adams_\(Internet_pioneer\) "Rick Adams (Internet pioneer)"), [Paul Vixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie "Paul Vixie"), and [Carl Malamud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud "Carl Malamud"), expressly to provide a home for BIND development and maintenance. BIND versions from 4.9.3 onward were developed and maintained by ISC, with support provided by ISC's sponsors. As co-architects/programmers, Bob Halley and Paul Vixie released the first production-ready version of BIND version 8 in May 1997. Since 2000, over 43 different core developers have worked on BIND.[^bind_home_page-21]

In November 1987, RFC 1034[^rfc1034-22] and RFC 1035[^rfc1035-5] superseded the 1983 DNS specifications. Several additional [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments "Request for Comments") have proposed extensions to the core DNS protocols.[^rfc7719-23]

The domain name space consists of a [tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(data_structure\) "Tree (data structure)"). Each node or leaf in the tree has a *label* and zero or more *resource records* (RR), which hold information associated with the domain name. The domain name itself consists of the label, concatenated with the name of its parent node on the right, separated by a dot.[^dnsterms-24]

The tree sub-divides into *zones* beginning at the [root zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone "DNS root zone"). A [DNS zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone "DNS zone") may consist of as many domains and subdomains as the zone manager chooses. DNS can also be partitioned according to *class* where the separate classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.[^dnsparts-25]

The hierarchical Domain Name System for class *Internet*, organized into zones, each served by a name server

Administrative responsibility for any zone may be divided by creating additional zones. Authority over the new zone is said to be *delegated* to a designated name server. The parent zone ceases to be authoritative for the new zone.[^dnsparts-25]

### Domain name syntax, internationalization

The definitive descriptions of the rules for forming domain names appear in RFC 1035, RFC 1123, RFC 2181, and RFC 5892. A [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name "Domain name") consists of one or more parts, technically called *labels*, that are conventionally [concatenated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated "Concatenated"), and delimited by dots, such as example.com.

The right-most label conveys the [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain "Top-level domain"); for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain *com*.

The hierarchy of domains descends from right to left; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or [subdomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain "Subdomain") of the domain to the right. For example, the label *example* specifies a subdomain of the *com* domain, and *www* is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels.[^26]

A label may contain zero to 63 characters, because the length is only allowed to take 6 bits. The null label of length zero is reserved for the root zone. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation (or 254 with the trailing dot).[^rfc1034-22] In the internal binary representation of the DNS this maximum length of 253 requires 255 octets of storage, as it also stores the length of the first of many labels and adds last null byte.[^rfc1035-5] 255 length is only achieved with at least 6 labels (counting the last null label).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### Address resolution mechanism

Domain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg/400px-Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg.png)

A DNS resolver that implements the iterative approach mandated by RFC 1034; in this case, the resolver consults three name servers to resolve the [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name "Fully qualified domain name") "www.wikipedia.org".

For proper operation of its domain name resolver, a network host is configured with an initial cache (*hints*) of the known addresses of the root name servers. The hints are updated periodically by an administrator by retrieving a dataset from a reliable source.

Assuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a query to one of the root servers. In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for "www.wikipedia.org" is referred to the *org* servers. The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeats this process until it receives an authoritative answer. The diagram illustrates this process for the host that is named by the [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name "Fully qualified domain name") "www.wikipedia.org".

This mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice [caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Record_caching) is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a relatively small fraction of all requests.

#### Recursive and caching name server

In theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the [root zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone "DNS root zone") of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.[^32]

To improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (*[time-to-live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-to-live "Time-to-live")*) of the domain name record in question. Typically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.

The combination of DNS caching and recursive functions in a name server is not mandatory; the functions can be implemented independently in servers for special purposes.

[Internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_providers "Internet service providers") typically provide recursive and caching name servers for their customers. In addition, many home networking routers implement DNS caches and recursion to improve efficiency in the local network.

The [client side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side "Client-side") of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. DNS resolvers are classified by a variety of query methods, such as *recursive*, *non-recursive*, and *iterative*. A resolution process may use a combination of these methods.[^rfc1034-22]

In a *non-recursive query*, a DNS resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case of a [caching DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Record_caching), the non-recursive query of its local [DNS cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server#Caching_name_server "Name server") delivers a result and reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS resource records for a period of time after an initial response from upstream DNS servers.

In a *recursive query*, a DNS resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple stub resolver running on a [home router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_router "Home router") typically makes a recursive query to the DNS server run by the user's [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP "ISP"). A recursive query is one for which the DNS server answers the query completely by querying other name servers as needed. In typical operation, a client issues a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which subsequently issues non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver, negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to support recursive queries.

The *iterative query* procedure is a process in which a DNS resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server refers the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root server, then a "com" server, and finally an "example.com" server.
