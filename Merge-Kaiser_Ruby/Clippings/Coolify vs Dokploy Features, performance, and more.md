Dokploy also natively supports multi-server deployment, meaning you can integrate services on different remote VPS to set up an application. While [Coolify offers a similar feature](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/multiple-servers/), it is still experimental.

**Winner – Dokploy**

This control panel integrates with Traefik out of the box and supports multi-server deployment.

### Customization and flexibility

Since Coolify and Dokploy are open-source control panels, you can modify their source code to customize their appearance or features.

Though the options are limited, Dokploy lets you change your control panel appearance using pre-made configurations. You can [create a custom Docker template](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/blob/canary/CONTRIBUTING.md#templates) to set up any applications, making it more flexible.

![[~/×/4d52045c0643403cf5f98ed62a9acbea_MD5.png]]

Coolify lacks a custom template but offers more options by default. Moreover, this control panel is more flexible regarding the web stack since it supports more databases.

**Winner – tie**

Both Dokploy and Coolify’s source code is customizable, meaning you can modify it freely. While Dokploy offers more customization options, Coolify offers more flexibility regarding infrastructure and technology.

#### Pro tip

Your control panel’s flexibility and customizability also depend on your web hosting provider. At Hostinger, we offer full root access that lets you change any server configuration. Some web hosts restrict this access, preventing you from fine-tuning the settings.

### Performance and scalability

Both Coolify and Dokploy require a minimum of a **two-core** processor, **2 GB** of RAM, and **30 GB** of storage space. However, you might need more resources depending on your project.

Based on the minimum requirements, expect both control panels to perform similarly. We tried installing them on the **Hostinger KVM 2 VPS plan** and checked the resource consumption through [hPanel’s built-in monitoring tool](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/9173071-how-to-enable-website-monitoring).

![[~/×/81781be5bfeeb68e02e767de3dd6b875_MD5.png]]

Based on our test, Coolify consumes **9%** of CPU and **41%** of RAM on idle without any application running. Meanwhile, Dokploy uses **9%** of CPU and **44%** of RAM in the same operational state.

However, Dokploy is easier to scale horizontally, meaning you can add new server instances to distribute the traffic and hardware load. This control panel supports native multi-server deployment and ships with the Traefix load balancer.

**Winner – Dokploy**

It offers more scaling opportunities by setting up more server instances and using the built-in load balancer.

![[~/×/834ed23e5fc32fec94515bed2156ca61_MD5.png]]

Moreover, Coolify enforces a no-vendor lock-in policy, giving you full control over your server settings and data even after deactivating the control panel. This policy helps avoid sensitive information leaks and improves privacy.

Both control panels offer automatic backups using an [S3-compliance provider](https://clumio.com/rto/s3-backup/). In addition, they let you adjust user roles and access permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Winner – Coolify**

It offers additional features like a pre-configured SSL certificate and enforces a no-vendor lock-in policy to ensure data privacy.

### Pricing

Both control panels are open-source and free. While Dokploy doesn’t offer a paid version, Coolify has a managed plan starting at **$4/month** per server.

Coolify’s free and premium plans have the same features, but the paid one offers a management service and extra support.

While both are free, you still need a Dokploy or [Coolify VPS hosting plan](https://www.hostinger.com/vps/coolify-hosting). Considering both have identical minimum requirements, you can expect to pay the same.
