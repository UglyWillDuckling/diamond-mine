***Koyaanisqatsi*** [^2] is a 1982 American [non-narrative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-narrative_film "Non-narrative film") [documentary film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film "Documentary film") directed and produced by [Godfrey Reggio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Reggio "Godfrey Reggio"), featuring music by [Philip Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass "Philip Glass") and cinematography by [Ron Fricke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Fricke "Ron Fricke"). Described as an "essay in images and sound on the state of American civilization",[^11] the film comprises a montage of [stock footage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage "Stock footage"), [slow motion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion "Slow motion"), and [time-lapse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse_photography "Time-lapse photography") visuals of natural and urban environments across the United States. Following its [premieres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere "Premiere") at the [Telluride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluride_Film_Festival "Telluride Film Festival") and [New York Film Festivals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Festival "New York Film Festival") in 1982, it began a [limited theatrical release](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release "Limited theatrical release") the next year. Produced on a budget of $2.5 million, the film grossed $3.2 million at the box office, and was one of the highest-grossing documentaries of the 1980s.

Grand Central Terminal in New York City is shown several times in the film.

The title comes from the [Hopi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_language "Hopi language") word *[koyaanisqatsi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/koyaanisqatsi "wikt:koyaanisqatsi")*, meaning "life out of balance".[^12] It is the first film in the [*Qatsi* trilogy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatsi_trilogy "Qatsi trilogy"), which was followed by *[Powaqqatsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powaqqatsi "Powaqqatsi")* (1988) and *[Naqoyqatsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqoyqatsi "Naqoyqatsi")* (2002).[^13] The trilogy depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans, nature and technology. *Koyaanisqatsi* is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a [cult film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film "Cult film").[^14] [^15]

*Koyaanisqatsi* runs for 86 minutes and comprises a montage of visuals accompanied by [minimal music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music "Minimal music"), without narration, dialogue, or [intertitles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle "Intertitle"). The film is structured into 13 passages, which are demarcated by dramatic musical shifts in the [score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score "Film score"). It opens with [pictographs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting "Cave painting") from the Great Gallery of [Horseshoe Canyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Canyon_\(Utah\) "Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)"), followed by a [close-up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up "Close-up") of a [rocket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") launch, while a deep [bass voice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_\(voice_type\) "Bass (voice type)") chants the film's title. The images [dissolve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolve_\(filmmaking\) "Dissolve (filmmaking)") into a sequence featuring landscapes of [geological formations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_formation "Geological formation") and [dunes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune "Dune") in the [deserts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert") of the [American Southwest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Southwest "American Southwest"). [Time-lapse imagery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse_photography "Time-lapse photography") shows shadows quickly moving across landscapes, and bats flying out of a [cave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave "Cave"). Clouds move in time-lapse footage, which is followed by a [waterfall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall "Waterfall"), then [ocean waves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_wave "Ocean wave") in [slow-motion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-motion "Slow-motion"). This segues into footage of [resources](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource "Resource"): [reservoirs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir "Reservoir"), [cultivated flowers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultigen "Cultigen"), [surface mining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_mining "Surface mining"), [electrical power infrastructure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission "Electric power transmission"), [evaporation ponds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation_pond "Evaporation pond"), [oil drilling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drilling "Oil drilling"), [blast furnaces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace "Blast furnace"), and concludes with a [nuclear weapons test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing "Nuclear weapons testing") forming a [mushroom cloud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_cloud "Mushroom cloud") over the desert.

The following sequence begins with people [sun bathing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_bathing "Sun bathing") on a beach next to a power plant, followed by people touring a power plant. The next images show clouds reflected on the [façade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade "Façade") of a glass skyscraper, [Boeing 747](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") aircraft [taxiing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxiing "Taxiing") at an airport, cars driving on urban [freeways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway "Controlled-access highway"), [military vehicles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_vehicle "Military vehicle") and [aircraft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft "Military aircraft"), and [air-to-ground weaponry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-ground_weaponry "Air-to-ground weaponry") being deployed. The film continues with modern skyscrapers in [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), followed by areas of [urban decay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_decay "Urban decay"). [Dilapidated buildings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilapidation "Dilapidation") and other abandoned infrastructure undergo [demolition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition "Demolition") and form large [dust clouds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_dust "Fugitive dust"). The sequence concludes with a [coda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_\(music\) "Coda (music)") featuring time-lapse footage of clouds and sunlight reflected in façades of glass skyscrapers in time-lapse, followed by people walking through busy city streets in slow-motion.

The next sequence begins with an [introduction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_\(music\) "Introduction (music)") that shows time-lapse footage of sunsets reflected in the façades of skyscrapers, [wide shots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_shot "Wide shot") of cities at night with vehicle lights moving fast along streets and freeways, and the [moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") disappearing behind a building. The [rhythm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm "Rhythm") of the music increases while time-lapse footage in cities show vehicles driving, crowds of people walking, shopping centers, factories, [food processing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing "Food processing") plants, and [channel surfing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_surfing "Channel surfing"). As the sequence comes to a close, the music and visuals are at their fastest, until the sequence ends and the music goes silent.

[Close-up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up "Close-up") shots of [microchips](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchips "Microchips") are interspersed with [satellite photography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_photography "Satellite photography") of city grids. The final sequence features various individuals of all [social classes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_classes "Social classes"), some of whom [look directly into the camera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall "Fourth wall"), accompanied by [Hopi prophecies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_mythology "Hopi mythology") sung in the soundtrack. As the film's title is chanted in a deep voice, a rocket is launched and explodes shortly after take-off; the camera follows its debris as it falls back towards Earth. The film concludes with another image of the pictograph seen in the opening shot.

*Koyaanisqatsi* opening title card, designed by Paul Pascarella

The end [title card](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_card "Title card") lists translations of the [Hopi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_language "Hopi language") word *koyaanisqatsi*:[^6]

1. "crazy life"
2. "life in turmoil"
3. "life out of balance"
4. "life disintegrating"
5. "a state of life that calls for another way of living"

The following screen shows a translation of the three Hopi prophecies sung near the end of the film:[^6]

- "If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster." [^3]
- "Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky." [^4]
- "A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans." [^5]

Over the [end credits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_credits "End credits"), the sound of human voices overlapping on television broadcasts can be heard.

In 1972, [Godfrey Reggio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Reggio "Godfrey Reggio"), of the Institute for Regional Education (IRE), was working on a media campaign in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was sponsored by the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union "American Civil Liberties Union") (ACLU). The campaign involved invasions of privacy and the use of technology to control behavior. Instead of making public service announcements, which Reggio felt "had no visibility", advertising spots were purchased for television, radio, newspapers, and billboards.[^17] Over thirty billboards were used for the campaign, and one design featured a close-up of the human eye, which Reggio described as a "horrifying image".[^18] To produce the television commercials the IRE hired cinematographer [Ron Fricke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Fricke "Ron Fricke"), who worked on the project for two years. The television advertisements aired during prime-time programming and became so popular that viewers would call the television stations to learn when the next advertisement would be aired.[^17] Godfrey described the two-year campaign as "extraordinarily successful", and as a result, [Ritalin (methylphenidate)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate "Methylphenidate") was eliminated as a behavior-modifying drug in many New Mexico school districts.[^18] But after the campaign ended, the ACLU eventually withdrew its sponsorship, and the IRE unsuccessfully attempted to raise millions of dollars at a fundraiser in Washington, D.C. The institute only had $40,000 left in its budget, and Reggio was unsure how to use the small amount of funds. Fricke insisted to Reggio that the money could be used to produce a film, which led to the production of *Koyaanisqatsi*.[^19]

The demolition of the [Pruitt–Igoe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruitt%E2%80%93Igoe "Pruitt–Igoe") housing project in St. Louis, Missouri, was one of the early scenes filmed once production began in 1975.

Reggio and Fricke chose to shoot unscripted footage and edit it into an hour-long film.[^19] Production began in 1975 in St. Louis, Missouri.[^20] [16 mm film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film "16 mm film") was used due to budget constraints, despite the preference to shoot with [35 mm film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/35mm_movie_film "35mm movie film").[^20] [^21] Footage of the [Pruitt–Igoe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruitt%E2%80%93Igoe "Pruitt–Igoe") housing project was shot from a helicopter, and Fricke nearly passed out during filming, having never flown in a helicopter before.[^19] Reggio later chose to shoot in [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") and New York City. As there was no formal script, Fricke shot whatever he felt would "look good on film".[^22] While filming in New York City, Fricke developed an idea to shoot portraits of people. A grey paper backdrop was displayed in Times Square, and Fricke stood 10 feet (3 m) back with the camera. People walking by started posing for the camera, thinking it was a [still camera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_camera "Still camera"), and several shots from the setup ended up in the film. Reggio was not on location in Times Square when Fricke shot the footage and thought the idea of shooting portraits of people was "foolish". Upon viewing the footage, Reggio decided to devote an entire section of the film to portraits. The footage was processed with a special chemical to enhance the film's shadows and details, as all footage was shot only with existing lighting. The IRE's $40,000 was exhausted after the filming, and almost two cases of film had been used. The unedited footage was screened in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but Fricke said it was "boring as hell" and there were "not that many good shots".[^22] Fricke later moved to Los Angeles, and took a job as a waiter, unable to get a job in the film industry. While Fricke was working in Los Angeles, he edited the footage into a 20-minute reel, but "without regard for message or political content".[^22]

> I just shot anything that I thought would look good on film. Shooting [bums](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness "Homelessness"), as well as buildings, didn't matter. It was all the same from my standpoint. I just shot the form of things.

—Ron Fricke [^22]

The IRE was continuously receiving funding and wanted to continue the project in 1976, using 35 mm film.[^22] After quitting his waiting job, Fricke traveled with a camera crew to the [Four Corners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners "Four Corners"), which was chosen for filming for its "alien look".[^23] Due to the limited budget, Fricke shot with a 16 mm [zoom lens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens "Zoom lens") onto 35 mm film. To compensate for the lens size, a 2× extender was added, which turned it into a full 35 mm zoom lens, allowing footage to be clearly captured onto 35 mm film. The two-week shoot included [aerial footage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_shot "Aerial shot") taken from an airplane using a [hand-held camera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-held_camera "Hand-held camera") and ground footage taken using a tripod. The first aerial footage was too "shaky", so additional footage was taken from a camera mounted onto the airplane. Fricke traveled back to New York City in 1977, during which [a major city-wide blackout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_blackout_of_1977 "New York City blackout of 1977") occurred. Footage of the blackout was filmed in Harlem and the South Bronx, and the film was [desaturated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness "Colorfulness") to match the appearance of the 16 mm footage.[^23]

Example of "time-lapse" video, which Koyaanisqatsi uses heavily

Reggio and Fricke came across time-lapse footage in "some low-visibility commercial work". They felt such footage was "the language \[they\] were missing", and collectively decided to implement time-lapse as a major part of the film to create "an experience of acceleration". For the time-lapse footage, Fricke purchased a [Mitchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Camera "Mitchell Camera") camera,[^23] and built a motor with an [intervalometer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervalometer "Intervalometer"), which was used to precisely move the camera between frames. The system was powered by a [gel cell battery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRLA_battery "VRLA battery") that lasted for twelve hours, which enabled Fricke to shoot without the use of a [generator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator "Electric generator").[^24] Most time-lapse shots were filmed at a [frame rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate "Frame rate") of 1½ frames per second. Fricke wanted the footage to "look normal" and not contain any "gimmicky" special effects.[^24] The time-lapse shot overlooking the freeway in Los Angeles was filmed from the top of a building through a [double exposure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_exposure "Multiple exposure"), with ten-second delay between frames. The first take was shot throughout the day for twelve hours, then the film was rewound and the same scene was shot at night for twenty minutes.[^24] The shot of the [Boeing 747](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") was filmed at [Los Angeles International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport "Los Angeles International Airport"), and was the longest continuous shot in the film. Fricke and his [focus puller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_puller "Focus puller"), Robert Hill, filmed at the airport every day for two weeks.[^25] To keep the shot of the aircraft within the frame, the camera was slowly moved by increasing the voltage to the gear motors.[^24]

In addition to footage shot by Fricke, some of the footage of people and traffic in New York City was shot by cinematographer [Hilary Harris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Harris "Hilary Harris"). During post-production, Reggio was introduced to Harris' *[Organism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism_\(film\) "Organism (film)")* (1975), which predominately features time-lapse footage of New York City streets. Reggio was impressed with Harris' work and subsequently hired him to work on *Koyaanisqatsi*.[^26] Footage filmed by cinematographer [Louis Schwartzberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Schwartzberg "Louis Schwartzberg") was added into the cloud sequence, and additional stock footage was provided by [MacGillivray Freeman Films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGillivray_Freeman_Films "MacGillivray Freeman Films").[^27]

While Reggio was working on post-production at the [Samuel Goldwyn Studio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn_Studio "Samuel Goldwyn Studio") in 1981,[^28] he met film director [Francis Ford Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola "Francis Ford Coppola") through an associate from [Zoetrope Studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope_Studios "Zoetrope Studios"), Coppola's production company. Before shooting *[The Outsiders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_\(film\) "The Outsiders (film)")* (1983) and *[Rumble Fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Fish "Rumble Fish")* (1983), Coppola requested to see *Koyaanisqatsi*, and Reggio arranged a private screening shortly after its completion.[^29] Coppola told Reggio that he was waiting for a film such as *Koyaanisqatsi* and that it was "important for people to see", so he added his name into the credits and helped present and distribute the film.[^30] Coppola also decided to introduce and end the film with footage of [pictographs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictogram "Pictogram") from the Great Gallery at [Horseshoe Canyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Canyon_\(Utah\) "Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)") in Utah after visiting the site and becoming fascinated by the ancient sandstone murals.[^31]

Composer [Philip Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass "Philip Glass") *(pictured in 1993)*

The film's score was composed by [Philip Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass "Philip Glass") and was performed by the [Philip Glass Ensemble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass_Ensemble "Philip Glass Ensemble"), conducted by [Michael Riesman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Riesman "Michael Riesman"). One piece written for the film, "Façades", was intended to be played over a montage of scenes from New York's [Wall Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street"). It ultimately was not used in the film; Glass released it as part of his album *[Glassworks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassworks_\(Glass\) "Glassworks (Glass)")* in 1982.[^32]

The opening for "The Grid" begins with slow sustained notes on brass instruments. The music builds in speed and [dynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_\(music\) "Dynamics (music)") throughout the piece's 21 minutes. When the piece is at its fastest, it is characterized by a [synthesizer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer "Synthesizer") playing the piece's bass line [ostinato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato "Ostinato").

Glass's music for the film is a highly recognizable example of the [minimalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music "Minimal music") school of composition, which is characterized by heavily repeated figures, simple structures, and a tonal (although not in the traditional [common practice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice "Common practice") sense of the word) harmonic language. Glass was one of the first composers to employ minimalism in film scoring, paving the way for many future composers of that style.[^33] The choral pieces were sung for the film by the [Western Wind Vocal Ensemble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Wind_Vocal_Ensemble&action=edit&redlink=1 "Western Wind Vocal Ensemble (page does not exist)"), a NYC-based 6-singer choral group specializing in choral and vocal music from many different eras and places, co-founded by [William Zukof](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Zukof&action=edit&redlink=1 "William Zukof (page does not exist)") and [Elliot Z. Levine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elliot_Z._Levine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elliot Z. Levine (page does not exist)").

The score is composed of nine [movements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_\(music\) "Movement (music)"),[^34] which are further divided into 13 discrete [sections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_\(music\) "Section (music)"), including [intros](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_\(music\) "Introduction (music)") and [codas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_\(music\) "Coda (music)").[^35]

1. "Koyaanisqatsi"
2. "Organic"
3. "Clouds"
4. "Resource"
5. "Vessels"
6. "Pruitt–Igoe"
7. "Slo-Mo People"
8. "The Grid"
9. "Microchip / Prophecies"

An abbreviated version of the film's soundtrack was released in 1983 by [Island Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Records "Island Records"). Despite the fact that the amount of music in the film was nearly as long as the film itself, this 1983 soundtrack release was only 46 minutes long, and only featured some of the film's pieces.

In 1998, Philip Glass re-recorded the film score for [Nonesuch Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonesuch_Records "Nonesuch Records") with a length of 73 minutes. This new recording includes new additional tracks that were cut from the film, as well as extended versions of tracks from the original album. This album was released as *Koyaanisqatsi*, rather than a soundtrack of the film.

In 2009, a remastered album was released under Philip Glass' own music label, Orange Mountain Music, as *Koyaanisqatsi: Complete Original Soundtrack*. This recording, with a length over 76 minutes, includes the original sound-effects and additional music that was used in the film.[^36]

The music has become so popular that the Philip Glass Ensemble has toured the world, playing the music for *Koyaanisqatsi* live in front of the movie screen.

Godfrey Reggio (pictured in 1995), director of *Koyaanisqatsi* and the other films in the Qatsi trilogy

Reggio stated that the *Qatsi* films are intended to simply create an experience and that "it is up \[to\] the viewer to take for himself/herself what it is that \[the film\] means." He also said that "these films have never been about the effect *of* technology, *of* industry *on* people. It's been that everyone: politics, education, things of the financial structure, the nation state structure, language, the culture, religion, all of that exists within the host of technology. So it's not the effect *of*, it's that everything exists within \[technology\]. It's not that we *use* technology, we *live* technology. Technology has become as ubiquitous as the air we breathe..." [^37]

Reggio initially wanted to avoid using a word in the film's title, and instead wanted to use a visual symbol. He intended on using the 1952 photograph of an audience wearing [3D glasses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_glasses "3D glasses"), taken by [J. R. Eyerman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Eyerman "J. R. Eyerman") for [*Life* magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_\(magazine\) "Life (magazine)"). As he was eventually forced to choose a word for the title, he "wanted a word that had no baggage culturally". He chose the word *[koyaanisqatsi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/koyaanisqatsi "wiktionary:koyaanisqatsi")*, which means "life out of balance" in [Hopi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_language "Hopi language"), a [Native American language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas "Indigenous languages of the Americas") spoken by the [Hopi people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi "Hopi"). Reggio learned the word from his friend [David Monongye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Monongye "David Monongye"), a spiritual leader in the Hopi community.[^35] Reggio explained the lack of dialogue by stating "it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live." [^37]

The word *koyaanisqatsi* literally translates to "chaotic life".[^38] It is a [compound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_\(linguistics\) "Compound (linguistics)") word composed of the [bound form](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_form "Bound form") *koyaanis-* ("corrupted" or "chaotic") [^38] and the word *qatsi* ("life" or "existence").[^39] The *[Hopi Dictionary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_Dictionary "Hopi Dictionary")* additionally defines *koyaanisqatsi* as "life of moral corruption and turmoil", referring to the life of a group.[^38] The latter translation has been used in promotional materials for the film and is one of the five definitions listed before the closing credits.[^6]

In the score by [Philip Glass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass "Philip Glass"), the word "koyaanisqatsi" is chanted at the beginning and end of the film in an "otherworldly" [^40] dark, sepulchral *[basso profondo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basso_profondo "Basso profondo")* by singer Albert de Ruiter over a solemn, four-bar organ-passacaglia bassline. Three [Hopi prophecies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_prophecies "Hopi prophecies") sung by a choral ensemble during the latter part of the "Prophecies" movement are translated just prior to the end credits.

During the end titles, the film gives [Jacques Ellul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul "Jacques Ellul"), [Ivan Illich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich "Ivan Illich"), [David Monongye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Monongye "David Monongye"), [Guy Debord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Debord "Guy Debord"), and [Leopold Kohr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kohr "Leopold Kohr") credit for inspiration. Moreover, amongst the consultants to the director are listed names including [Jeffrey Lew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Lew "Jeffrey Lew"), T. A.

*Koyaanisqatsi* was first publicly screened as a [workprint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workprint "Workprint") at the [Santa Fe Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Film_Festival "Santa Fe Film Festival") on April 27, 1982.[^41] Later that year, the film [premiered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere "Premiere") at the [Telluride Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluride_Film_Festival "Telluride Film Festival") on September 5.[^6] It was screened again at the [New York Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Festival "New York Film Festival") (NYFF) on October 4, which was promoted as the film's "world premiere", despite its previous screening in September.[^42] While the NYFF was based in the [Lincoln Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Center "Lincoln Center"), an exception was made to screen *Koyaanisqatsi* at the larger [Radio City Music Hall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall "Radio City Music Hall") due to the film's "spectacular visual and sound quality".[^43]

[Triumph Films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Films "Triumph Films") offered to distribute the film, but Reggio turned down the offer as he wanted to work with a smaller company so he could be more involved with the release. He chose Island Alive as the distributor, a company newly formed in 1983 by [Chris Blackwell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Blackwell "Chris Blackwell") of [Island Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Records "Island Records"),[^44] and *Koyaanisqatsi* was the company's first release. Select theaters distributed a pamphlet that defined the title and the Hopi prophecies sung in the film, as well as a copy of the soundtrack from Island Records. The first theatrical run featured four-track [Dolby Stereo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Stereo "Dolby Stereo") sound, while later runs featured [monaural](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural "Monaural") sound.

The film's initial limited release began in San Francisco at the [Castro Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_Theatre "Castro Theatre") on April 27, 1983.[^45] The producers spent $6,500 on marketing the initial release, which grossed $46,000 throughout its one-week run, and was the highest-grossing film in the San Francisco Bay Area that week. It was released in Los Angeles a month later where it grossed $300,000 at two theaters within 15 weeks. Additional releases in select cities throughout the United States continued in September 1983, beginning with a release in New York City on September 15. In mid-October, *Koyaanisqatsi* was released onto 40 to 50 screens throughout the country. It was a surprise [arthouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_film "Art film") hit as well as a popular presentation at colleges and universities.[^46] [^47] [^48] Due to its Periphery Demographic fandom of [Stoners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_culture "Cannabis culture"). Alongside the traditional arthouse audience.

It ultimately grossed $3.2 million at the box office, and became the second-highest-grossing documentary of the 1980s, following *[Roger & Me](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_%26_Me "Roger & Me")* (1989).[^9]

*Koyaanisqatsi* was originally released on VHS and laserdisc by [Michael Nesmith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Nesmith "Michael Nesmith") 's [Pacific Arts Video](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Arts_Corporation "Pacific Arts Corporation").[^49] [^50] However, because of copyright issues, the film was out of print for most of the 1990s.[^51] In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [National Film Registry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry "National Film Registry") by the [Library of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") for being "culturally, aesthetically, or historically significant".[^52] [^53]

The rights to *Koyaanisqatsi* were passed through various multinational entertainment companies, which eventually prevented a home video release. IRE enforced their legal and contractual rights by creating a federal court lawsuit. IRE distributed a privately issued release of the film on DVD. The release was available to those who made a donation of at least $180 to IRE, and was distributed in a sleeve that was signed by Reggio.[^54]

[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer") eventually received the rights to the film, and *Koyaanisqatsi* was released on DVD by [MGM Home Entertainment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Home_Entertainment "MGM Home Entertainment") on September 18, 2002, coinciding with the release of *[Naqoyqatsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqoyqatsi "Naqoyqatsi")* (2002). Both films were available in a two-disc box set. Each DVD includes a documentary with interviews by Reggio and Glass and trailers for the [*Qatsi* trilogy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatsi_trilogy "Qatsi trilogy").[^55] Unlike the IRE release, which featured the film in the [open matte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_matte "Open matte") format in which it was filmed, the MGM release was cropped into a widescreen aspect as it originally was presented in theaters.[^56]

On January 13, 2012, a Blu-ray version (screen ratio 16:9) was released in Germany.[^57] The Blu-ray was also released in Australia by Umbrella Entertainment on March 22, 2012.[^58] In December 2012, [Criterion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criterion_Collection "The Criterion Collection") released a remastered DVD and Blu-ray of *Koyaanisqatsi*, as part of a box set containing the *Qatsi* Trilogy. The release features 5.1 surround sound audio and a restored digital transfer of the film in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, approved by director Godfrey Reggio.[^59]

On [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), *Koyaanisqatsi* has an approval rating of 91% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads " *Koyaanisqatsi* combines striking visuals and a brilliant score to produce a viewing experience that manages to be formally daring as well as purely entertaining." [^60] [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic") assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews".[^61] In 1983, the film was entered into the [33rd Berlin International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/33rd_Berlin_International_Film_Festival "33rd Berlin International Film Festival").[^62] Czech pedagogue [Rudolf Adler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Adler "Rudolf Adler"), in his textbook for film educators, describes *Koyaanisqatsi* as "formulated with absolute precision and congenial expression." [^63]<sup><span title="Page / location: 60">: 60 </span></sup>  It has also been described as a [postmodernist film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernist_film "Postmodernist film").[^64]
