## Notes ğŸ—’
- the GeoAPI can be used to retrieve:
	- `coordinates` - based on address
	- `street` - mapped to `street_name`
- we can create an `iris` object based on the `coordinates`
	- this can later be replaced later if needed(lead could get this)
- **fake** estima doesn't always have `address_id`
