%%  I like having this button, it communicates well and makes things easy  since I don't have to remember everything %%
%% It also nudges me to look at the broader picture ðŸ–¼ instead of just adding an new person in like I would using [[quickAdd]] %%

# People MOC
A personal CRM. People Notes are about jotting down notable information about people and linking people back to [[ðŸ—£ Meetings MOC]].

These are the different categories of People Notes:
- [[#work]]
- Creative
- **Fictional**
- **Notable**

%% the categories are interesting, I like the Fictional one in particular %%
%% This could easily be expanded to include other categories and even combine them %%

%% I like the sorting by alphabet %%

## work

```dataview
table title, work_status
from #person/work
sort file.name asc
```

## creative

```dataview
table title
from #person/creative
sort file.name asc
```

## everybody
```dataview
table title
from #person 
sort file.name asc
```
