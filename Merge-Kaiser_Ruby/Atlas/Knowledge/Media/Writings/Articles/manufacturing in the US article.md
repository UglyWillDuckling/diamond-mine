## SUMMARY

In terms of value added, the primary measure of economic activity, **the U.S. is the second largest manufacturing nation in the world behind that of China.** The U.S. ranking as a brand suggests that it tends to be a differentiator rather than a cost competitor; however, a number of nations rank higher as a brand. In terms of value added, the largest subsectors of manufacturing are chemical products; food, beverage, and tobacco products; and computer and electronic products, as shown in Figure 2.9 and Figure 2.10 of NIST AMS 600-16.

There are three primary aspects of examining U.S. manufacturing statistics on competitiveness: (1) how the U.S. industry compares to other countries, (2) the trends in the domestic industry, and (3) the industry trends compared to those in other countries. [NIST AMS 600-16](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.600-16) provides statistics on these aspects. Below are highlights from this publication. Due to the necessity to use a selection of datasets, there may be minor discrepancies between various statistics. Additional data and statistics can be estimated using NIST’s [Manufacturing Cost Guide](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/manufacturing-cost-guide).

## ***Manufacturing in Brief***

Some brief figures on U.S. manufacturing include the following:

- In 2023, Manufacturing contributed $2.3 trillion to U.S. GDP amounting to 10.2 % of total U.S. GDP, measured in chained 2017 dollars, according to BEA data.
	- Direct and indirect (i.e., purchases from other industries) manufacturing value added contributed an estimated 17.1 % of GDP (see Table 3.2 of AMS 600-16).
- According to the Current Population Survey, there were 15.6 million employees in U.S. manufacturing in 2023, representing 9.7 % of total U.S. employment.

## ***U.S. as a Brand***

Frequently, countries are discussed as brands. Two rankings provide insight into the U.S. as a brand:

- U.S. ranks 6 <sup>th</sup> in the Ipsos National Brands Index
- U.S. ranks 10 <sup>th</sup> among 49 total countries in Statistica’s Made-in-Country Index

## ***Inflation***

Inflation has increased in recent years, which diminishes purchasing power.

- The prices received by producers for all manufacturing between July 2020 and July 2022 increased 33.4 %
	- For context, in the fifteen years prior to that (i.e., June 2005 to June 2020) it increased 27.1 % in total

## ***Manufacturing Growth***

- U.S. compound real (i.e., controlling for inflation) annual growth between 1997 and 2022 (i.e., 25-year growth) was 1.7 %, which places the U.S. below the 50 <sup>th</sup> percentile.
- The compound annual growth for the U.S. between 2017 and 2022 (i.e., 5-year growth) was 1.5 %. This puts the U.S. just below the 50 <sup>th</sup> percentile and below the world average of 2.9 %.
