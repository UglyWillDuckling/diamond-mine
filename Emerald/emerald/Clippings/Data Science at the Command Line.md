## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m [Jeroen](https://jeroenjanssens.com/).

In 2021 I wrote the second edition of *Data Science at the Command Line*, which you can read entirely for free here. If you find this book helpful, consider spreading the word! You could, for instance, share it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdatascienceatthecommandline.com&via=jeroenhjanssens&text=Data%20Science%20at%20the%20Command%20Line%2C%20second%20edition), write a review on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Command-Line-Explore-dp-1492087912/dp/1492087912), or star the [Github repository](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line). Much appreciated!
