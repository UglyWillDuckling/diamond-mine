A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction is a 1977 book on architecture, urban design, and community livability. It was authored by [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Sara Ishikawa]] and [[Murray Silverstein]] of the [[Center for Environmental Structure of Berkeley]], California, with writing credits also to [[Max Jacobson]], [[Ingrid Fiksdahl-King]] and [[Shlomo Angel]]. 
Decades after its publication, it is still one of the best-selling books on architecture.[1] 

The book creates a new language, what the authors call a pattern language derived from timeless entities called patterns. As they write on page xxxv of the introduction, "All 253 patterns together form a language." Patterns describe a problem and then offer a solution. In doing so the authors intend to give ordinary people, not only professionals, a way to work with their neighbors to improve a town or neighborhood, design a house for themselves or work with colleagues to design an office, workshop, or public building such as a school.
