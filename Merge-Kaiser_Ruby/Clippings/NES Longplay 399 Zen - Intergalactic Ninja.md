This game came out towards the end of the NES life span in 1993, which is about the time Sega Geneis and the Super NES were picking up in popularity.  
It certainly was a decent send off for the system, probably being one of the last to mark Konami's farewell to the NES before moving onto bigger things.  
Despite the plot that seems it came from a B Movie and addresses the American culture at the time like Captain Planet did, this was still some good ole' fashion fun. -
