The **Indigenous peoples of the Americas** are the peoples who are native to [the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americas "The Americas"), or the [Western Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere "Western Hemisphere"). Their ancestors are among the [pre-Columbian population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_population "Pre-Columbian population") of [South](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") or [North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"), including [Central America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America") and the [Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean"). Indigenous peoples live throughout the Americas. While often minorities in their countries, Indigenous peoples are the majority in [Greenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Greenland "Indigenous peoples in Greenland") [^36] and close to a majority in [Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Bolivia "Indigenous peoples in Bolivia") [^37] and [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Guatemala "Indigenous peoples in Guatemala").[^38]

There are at least 1,000 different [Indigenous languages of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas "Indigenous languages of the Americas"). Some languages, including [Quechua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages "Quechuan languages"), [Arawak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak_language "Arawak language"), [Aymara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language "Aymara language"), [Guaraní](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani_language "Guarani language"), [Nahuatl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl "Nahuatl"), and [some Mayan languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_languages "Mayan languages"), have millions of speakers and are recognized as official by governments in [Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia"), [Peru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"), [Paraguay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay "Paraguay"), and [Greenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland").

Indigenous peoples, whether residing in rural or urban areas, often maintain aspects of their cultural practices, including [religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_religions "Native American religions"), [social organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization "Social organization"), and [subsistence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_economy "Subsistence economy") practices. Over time, these cultures have evolved, preserving traditional customs while adapting to modern needs. Some Indigenous groups remain relatively isolated from [Western culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture"), with some still classified as [uncontacted peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples "Uncontacted peoples").

The Americas also host millions of individuals of mixed Indigenous, European, and sometimes African or Asian descent, historically referred to as [mestizos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo "Mestizo") in Spanish-speaking countries.[^39] [^40] In many [Latin American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America") nations, people of partial Indigenous descent constitute a majority or significant portion of the population, particularly in [Central America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America"), [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), Peru, Bolivia, [Ecuador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador"), [Colombia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia"), [Venezuela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela "Venezuela"), [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"), and Paraguay.[^41] [^42] [^43] Mestizos outnumber Indigenous peoples in most Spanish-speaking countries, according to estimates of ethnic cultural identification. However, since Indigenous communities in the Americas are defined by [cultural identification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identification "Cultural identification") and [kinship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship "Kinship") rather than ancestry or [race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_\(human_categorization\) "Race (human categorization)"), mestizos are typically not counted among the Indigenous population unless they speak an Indigenous language or identify with a specific Indigenous culture.[^44] Additionally, many individuals of wholly Indigenous descent who do not follow Indigenous traditions or speak an Indigenous language have been classified or self-identified as mestizo due to assimilation into the dominant [Hispanic culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_culture "Hispanic culture"). In recent years, the self-identified Indigenous population in many countries has increased as individuals reclaim their heritage amid rising Indigenous-led movements for [self-determination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination") and [social justice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice").[^45]

In past centuries, Indigenous peoples had diverse societal, governmental, and subsistence systems. Some Indigenous peoples were historically [hunter-gatherers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherers "Hunter-gatherers"), while others practiced [agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") and [aquaculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture "Aquaculture"). Various Indigenous societies developed complex [social structures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure "Social structure"), including precontact monumental architecture, organized [cities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City "City"), [city-states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state"), [chiefdoms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiefdoms "Chiefdoms"), [states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_\(polity\) "State (polity)"), [kingdoms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy"), [republics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic "Republic"), [confederacies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation "Confederation"), and [empires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire "Empire").[^46] These societies possessed varying levels of knowledge in fields such as [engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_engineering_in_the_Americas "Pre-Columbian engineering in the Americas"), [architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_architecture "Pre-Columbian architecture"), [mathematics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [astronomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [writing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing "History of writing"), [physics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [medicine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_agriculture "Pre-Columbian agriculture"), [irrigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation "Irrigation"), [geology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), [mining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining"), [metallurgy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy"), [art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_art "Pre-Columbian art"), [sculpture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_American_sculpture "Indigenous American sculpture"), and [goldsmithing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldsmithing "Goldsmithing").

Application of the term " [Indian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_name_controversy#%22Indian%22_and_%22American_Indian%22_\(since_1492\) "Native American name controversy") " originated with [Christopher Columbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus"), who, when searching for [India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), made landfall in the Americas but thought he had arrived in the [East Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies "East Indies").[^47] [^48] [^49] [^50] [^51] [^52]

The islands came to be known as the " [West Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies "West Indies") " (or " [Antilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilles "Antilles") "), a name that is still used to describe the islands. This led to the blanket term "Indies" and "Indians" ([Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"): *indios*; [Portuguese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"): *índios*; [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): *indiens*; [Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language"): *indianen*) for the Indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of ethnic or cultural unity among the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of Indigenous peoples themselves but has since been embraced or tolerated by many over the last two centuries.[^53] The term *First Nations* is used in Canada to identify that type of Indigenous people.

The term "Indian" (or First Nations in Canada) generally does not include the culturally and [linguistically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo-Aleut "Eskimo-Aleut") distinct Indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas, including the [Aleuts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleut "Aleut"), [Inuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit "Inuit"), or [Yupik peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yupik_peoples "Yupik peoples"). These peoples entered the continent as a second, more recent wave of migration several thousand years later and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the [Indigenous peoples of Siberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Siberia "Indigenous peoples of Siberia"). However, these groups are nonetheless considered among the "Indigenous peoples of the Americas".[^54]

The term *Amerindian*, a [portmanteau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau "Portmanteau") of "American Indian", was coined in 1902 by the [American Anthropological Association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Anthropological_Association "American Anthropological Association"). It has been controversial ever since its creation. It was immediately rejected by some leading members of the Association, and, while adopted by many, it was never universally accepted.[^55] While never popular in Indigenous communities themselves, it remains a preferred term among some anthropologists, notably in some parts of Canada and the [English-speaking Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Caribbean "Commonwealth Caribbean").[^56] [^57] [^58] [^59]

" [Indigenous peoples in Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada "Indigenous peoples in Canada") " is used as the collective name for [First Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada "First Nations in Canada"), [Inuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit "Inuit"), and [Métis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis_\(Canada\) "Métis (Canada)").[^60] [^61] The term *Aboriginal peoples* as a [collective noun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun "Collective noun") (also describing First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) is a specific [term of art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_of_art "Term of art") used in some legal documents, including the [Constitution Act, 1982](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982 "Constitution Act, 1982").[^62] Over time, as societal perceptions and government–indigenous relationships have shifted, many historical terms have changed definitions or been replaced as they have fallen out of favor.[^63] The use of the term "Indian" is frowned upon because it represents the imposition and restriction of Indigenous peoples and cultures by the Canadian Government.[^63] The terms "Native" and " [Eskimo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo "Eskimo") " are generally regarded as disrespectful (in Canada), and so are rarely used unless specifically required.[^64] While "Indigenous peoples" is the preferred term, many individuals or communities may choose to describe their identity using a different term.[^63] [^64]

The Métis people of Canada can be contrasted, for instance, to the Indigenous-European mixed-race [mestizos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizos "Mestizos") (or *[caboclos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caboclos "Caboclos")* in Brazil) of [Hispanic America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_America "Hispanic America") whose large populations constitute outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities in most Latin American countries. They identify largely as an ethnic group distinct from Europeans and Indigenous, but consider themselves a subset of the European-derived [Hispanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanidad "Hispanidad") or [Brazilian peoplehood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilians "Brazilians") in culture and ethnicity ([cf.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf. "Cf.")*[ladinos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladino_people "Ladino people")*).

Among [Spanish-speaking countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-speaking_countries "Spanish-speaking countries"), *indígenas* or *pueblos indígenas* ("Indigenous peoples") is a common term, though *nativos* or *pueblos nativos* ('native peoples') may also be heard; moreover, *aborigen* ('aborigine') is used in [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina") and *pueblos originarios* ('original peoples') is common in [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"). In Brazil, *indígenas* and *povos originários* ("Indigenous peoples") are common formal-sounding designations, while *índio* ('Indian') is still the more often heard term (the noun for the South-Asian nationality being *indiano*), but since the early 2010s has been considered offensive and pejorative.*Aborígene* and *nativo* are rarely used in Brazil in Indigenous-specific contexts (e.g., *aborígene* is usually understood as the ethnonym for [Indigenous Australians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians "Indigenous Australians")). The Spanish and Portuguese equivalents to *Indian*, nevertheless, could be used to mean any [hunter-gatherer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, *[indios filipinos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos#Hispanized_caste_system "Filipinos")*.

Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as [Native Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States"), Indians, as well as [Alaska Natives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives "Alaska Natives"). The term "Indian" is still used in some communities and remains in use in the official names of many institutions and businesses in [Indian Country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Country "Indian Country").[^65]

[Quechua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua_people "Quechua people") women in festive dress on [Taquile Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taquile_Island "Taquile Island") on [Lake Titicaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Titicaca "Lake Titicaca"), west of [Peru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru")

The various nations, tribes, and bands of Indigenous peoples of the Americas have differing preferences in terminology for themselves.[^66] While there are regional and generational variations in which umbrella terms are preferred for Indigenous peoples as a whole, in general, most Indigenous peoples prefer to be identified by the name of their specific nation, tribe, or band.[^66] [^67]

Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming has often been based on shared language, region, or historical relationship.[^68] Many English [exonyms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exonyms "Exonyms") have been used to refer to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [endonyms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonyms "Endonyms") from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonists and Indigenous peoples.[^69]

Since the late 20th century, Indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress the use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [racist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism"). During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [Indian rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rights_movement "Indian rights movement"), the [United States federal government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") responded by proposing the use of the term " [Native American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States") ", to recognize the primacy of Indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation.[^70] As may be expected among people of over 400 different cultures in the US alone, not all of the people intended to be described by this term have agreed on its use or adopted it. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all Indigenous peoples in the Americas. Most prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations when not speaking about Native Americans/American Indians as a whole.[^71]

Since the 1970s, the word "Indigenous", which is capitalized when referring to people, has gradually emerged as a favored umbrella term. The capitalization is to acknowledge that Indigenous peoples have cultures and societies that are equal to Europeans, Africans, and Asians.[^67] [^72] This has recently been acknowledged in the *[AP Stylebook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook "AP Stylebook")*.[^73] Some consider it improper to refer to Indigenous people as "Indigenous Americans" or to append any colonial nationality to the term because Indigenous cultures existed before European colonization. Indigenous groups have territorial claims that are different from modern national and international borders, and when labeled as part of a country, their traditional lands are not acknowledged. Some who have written guidelines consider it more appropriate to describe an Indigenous person as "living in" or "of" the Americas, rather than calling them "American"; or simply calling them "Indigenous" without any addition of a colonial state.[^74] [^75]

It is believed that the [peopling of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas "Peopling of the Americas") began when [Paleolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic "Upper Paleolithic") [hunter-gatherers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") ([Paleo-Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indians "Paleo-Indians")) entered [North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") from the [North Asian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia "North Asia") [Mammoth steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe "Mammoth steppe") via the [Beringia land bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia_land_bridge "Beringia land bridge"), which had formed between northeastern [Siberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia") and western [Alaska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska") due to the lowering of [sea level](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level") during the [Last Glacial Maximum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum "Last Glacial Maximum") (26,000 to 19,000 years ago).[^77] These populations expanded south of the [Laurentide Ice Sheet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentide_Ice_Sheet "Laurentide Ice Sheet") and spread rapidly southward, occupying both [North and South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas") no later than 14,000 years ago, and possibly even before 20,000 years ago.[^78] [^79] [^80] [^81] [^82] The earliest populations in the Americas, before roughly 10,000 years ago, are known as [Paleo-Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indians "Paleo-Indians"). Indigenous peoples of the Americas have been linked to Siberian populations by proposed [linguistic factors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dene%E2%80%93Yeniseian_languages "Dene–Yeniseian languages"), the distribution of [blood types](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_types "Blood types"), and in [genetic composition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_the_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Genetic history of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas") as reflected by [molecular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") data, such as [DNA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA").[^83] [^84]

While there is general agreement that the Americas were first settled from Asia, the pattern of migration and the place(s) of origin in Eurasia of the peoples who migrated to the Americas remain unclear.[^79] The traditional theory is that [Ancient Beringians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Beringian "Ancient Beringian") moved when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the [Quaternary glaciation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation"),[^85] [^86] following herds of now-extinct [Pleistocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene") [megafauna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafauna "Megafauna") along *ice-free corridors* that stretched between the [Laurentide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentide_Ice_Sheet "Laurentide Ice Sheet") and [Cordilleran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordilleran_Ice_Sheet "Cordilleran Ice Sheet") ice sheets.[^87] Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using [boats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat#History "Boat"), they migrated down the Pacific coast to [South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") as far as [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile").[^88] Any archaeological evidence of coastal occupation during the last Ice Age would now have been covered by the [sea level rise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise"), up to a hundred metres since then.[^89]

The precise date for the peopling of the Americas is a long-standing open question. While advances in [archaeology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology"), [Pleistocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene") [geology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), [physical anthropology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_anthropology "Physical anthropology"), and [DNA analysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_analysis "DNA analysis") have progressively shed more light on the subject, significant questions remain unresolved.[^90] [^91] The [Clovis First theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_First_theory "Clovis First theory") refers to the hypothesis that the [Clovis culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture "Clovis culture") represents the earliest human presence in the Americas about 13,000 years ago.[^92] [Evidence of pre-Clovis cultures has accumulated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_the_Clovis_First_theory "Alternatives to the Clovis First theory") and pushed back the possible date of the first peopling of the Americas.[^93] [^94] [^95] [^96] Academics generally believe that humans reached North America south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at some point between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago.[^90] [^93] [^97] [^98] [^99] [^100] Some new controversial archaeological evidence suggests the possibility that human arrival in the Americas may have occurred prior to the [Last Glacial Maximum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum "Last Glacial Maximum") more than 20,000 years ago.[^93] [^101] [^102] [^103] [^104] [^105]

While technically referring to the era before [Christopher Columbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") ' voyages of 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of Indigenous cultures until Europeans either conquered or significantly influenced them.[^106] "Pre-Columbian" is used especially often in the context of discussing the pre-contact [Mesoamerican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican "Mesoamerican") [Indigenous societies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pre-Columbian_cultures "List of pre-Columbian cultures"): [Olmec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec "Olmec"); [Toltec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec "Toltec"); [Teotihuacano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan "Teotihuacan") ' [Zapotec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization "Zapotec civilization"); [Mixtec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec "Mixtec"); [Aztec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec") and [Maya civilizations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization"); and the [complex cultures of the Andes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_civilizations "Andean civilizations"): [Inca Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire "Inca Empire"), [Moche culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche_culture "Moche culture"), [Muisca Confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_Confederation "Muisca Confederation"), and [Cañari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C3%B1ari "Cañari").

Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant European and African arrivals (ca. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through [oral history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history "Oral history") and through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period and were documented in historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, [Aztec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire "Aztec Empire"), and [Nahua peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahua_peoples "Nahua peoples"), had their written languages and records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs and burned many pre-Columbian written records. Only a few documents remained hidden and survived, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

According to both Indigenous and European accounts and documents, American civilizations before and at the time of European encounter had achieved great complexity and many accomplishments.[^110] For instance, the Aztecs built one of the largest cities in the world, [Tenochtitlan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenochtitlan "Tenochtitlan") (the historical site of what would become [Mexico City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City "Mexico City")), with an estimated population of 200,000 for the city proper and a population of close to five million for the extended empire.[^111] By comparison, the largest European cities in the 16th century were Constantinople and Paris with 300,000 and 200,000 inhabitants respectively.[^112] The population in London, Madrid, and Rome hardly exceeded 50,000 people. In 1523, right around the time of the Spanish conquest, the entire population in the country of England was just under three million people.[^113] This fact speaks to the level of sophistication, agriculture, governmental procedure, and rule of law that existed in Tenochtitlan, needed to govern over such a large citizenry. Indigenous civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics, including the most accurate calendar in the world. The domestication of [maize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") or corn required thousands of years of selective breeding, and continued cultivation of multiple varieties was done with planning and selection, generally by women.

Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and Indigenous [creation myths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth") tell of a variety of origins of their respective peoples. Some were "always there" or were created by gods or animals, some migrated from a specified [compass point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass "Points of the compass"), and others came from "across the ocean".[^114]

The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the resident Indigenous peoples. Although the exact pre-colonization population count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Indigenous populations diminished by between 80% and 90% during the first centuries of European colonization. Most scholars estimate a pre-colonization population of around 50 million, with other scholars arguing for an estimate of 100 million. Estimates reach as high as 145 million.[^115] [^116] [^117] [William Denevan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Denevan "William Denevan") estimates of the pre-contact population range from 8 million to 112 million, falling to under 6 million by 1650.[^118]

Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases, such as [smallpox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox"), [measles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles"), and [cholera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera "Cholera"), which the early colonists brought from Europe. The spread of infectious diseases was slow initially, as most Europeans were not actively or visibly infected, due to inherited immunity from generations of exposure to these diseases in Europe. This changed when the Europeans began the [human trafficking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking "Human trafficking") of massive numbers of [enslaved Western and Central African people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade "Atlantic slave trade") to the Americas. Like Indigenous peoples, these African people, newly exposed to European diseases, lacked any inherited resistance to the diseases of Europe. In 1520, an African who had been infected with smallpox had arrived in Yucatán. By 1558, the disease had spread throughout South America and had arrived at the Plata basin.[^119] Colonist violence towards Indigenous peoples accelerated the loss of lives. European colonists perpetrated massacres on the Indigenous peoples and enslaved them.[^120] [^121] [^122] According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the [North American Indian Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars "American Indian Wars") of the 19th century had a known death toll of about 19,000 Europeans and 30,000 Native Americans, and an estimated total death toll of 45,000 Native Americans.[^123]

The first Indigenous group encountered by Columbus, the 250,000 [Taínos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno "Taíno") of [Hispaniola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola "Hispaniola"), represented the dominant culture in the [Greater Antilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Antilles "Greater Antilles") and the Bahamas. Within thirty years about 70% of the Taínos had died.[^124] They had no immunity to European diseases, so outbreaks of [measles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles") and [smallpox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") ravaged their population.[^125] One such outbreak occurred in a camp of enslaved Africans, where smallpox spread to the nearby [Taíno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno "Taíno") population and reduced their numbers by 50%.[^119] Increasing punishment of the Taínos for revolting against forced labor, despite measures put in place by the [encomienda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda "Encomienda"), which included religious education and protection from warring tribes,[^126] eventually led to the last great [Taíno rebellion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_rebellion "Taíno rebellion") (1511–1529).

Following years of mistreatment, the Taínos began to adopt suicidal behaviors, with women aborting or killing their infants and men jumping from cliffs or ingesting untreated [cassava](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava "Cassava"), a violent poison.[^124] Eventually, a Taíno Cacique named [Enriquillo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriquillo "Enriquillo") managed to hold out in the [Baoruco Mountain Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoruco_Mountain_Range "Baoruco Mountain Range") for thirteen years, causing serious damage to the Spanish, Carib-held plantations and their [Indian auxiliaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_auxiliaries "Indian auxiliaries").[^127] Hearing of the seriousness of the revolt, [Emperor Charles V](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor") (also King of Spain) sent Captain Francisco Barrionuevo to negotiate a peace treaty with the ever-increasing number of rebels. Two months later, after consultation with the Audencia of Santo Domingo, Enriquillo was offered any part of the island to live in peace.

The [Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Burgos "Laws of Burgos"), were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in America, particularly concerning Indigenous peoples. The laws forbade the maltreatment of them and endorsed their conversion to [Catholicism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism").[^128] The Spanish crown found it difficult to enforce these laws in distant colonies.

Epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the [population decline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline "Population decline") of the Indigenous peoples.[^129] [^130] After initial contact with Europeans and Africans, [Old World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World "Old World") diseases caused the deaths of 90 to 95% of the native population of the [New World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World") in the following 150 years.[^131] [Smallpox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") killed from one-third to half of the native population of Hispaniola in 1518.[^132] [^133] By killing the Incan ruler [Huayna Capac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayna_Capac "Huayna Capac"), smallpox caused the [Inca Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Civil_War "Inca Civil War") of 1529–1532. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. [Typhus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus "Typhus") (probably) in 1546, [influenza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza "Influenza") and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, [diphtheria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria "Diphtheria") in 1614, and [measles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles") in 1618—all ravaged the remains of Inca culture.

Smallpox killed millions of native inhabitants of Mexico.[^134] [^135] Unintentionally introduced at Veracruz with the arrival of [Pánfilo de Narváez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1nfilo_de_Narv%C3%A1ez "Pánfilo de Narváez") on 23 April 1520, smallpox ravaged Mexico in the 1520s,[^136] possibly killing over 150,000 in Tenochtitlán (the heartland of the Aztec Empire) alone, and aiding in the victory of [Hernán Cortés](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s "Hernán Cortés") over the [Aztec Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire "Aztec Empire") at Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City) in 1521.[^119]

There are many factors as to why Indigenous peoples suffered such immense losses from Afro-Eurasian diseases. Many Old World diseases, like cow pox, are acquired from domesticated animals that are not indigenous to the Americas. European populations had adapted to these diseases, and built up resistance, over many generations. Many of the Old World diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [yellow fever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever "Yellow fever"), that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult. Children could often survive the disease, resulting in immunity to the disease for the rest of their lives. But contact with the disease by adults without this childhood or inherited immunity often proved fatal.[^119] [^137]

Colonization of the Caribbean led to the destruction of the [Arawaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak "Arawak") of the [Lesser Antilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles "Lesser Antilles"). Their culture was destroyed by 1650. Only 500 had survived by the year 1550, though the bloodlines continued through to the modern populace. In Amazonia, Indigenous societies weathered centuries of colonization and genocide.[^138]

Contact with European diseases such as smallpox and measles killed between 50 and 67 percent of the Indigenous population of North America in the first hundred years after the arrival of Europeans.[^139] Some 90 percent of the native population near [Massachusetts Bay Colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony "Massachusetts Bay Colony") died of smallpox in an epidemic in 1617–1619.[^140] In 1633, in [Fort Orange (New Netherland)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Orange_\(New_Netherland\) "Fort Orange (New Netherland)"), the Native Americans there were exposed to smallpox because of contact with Europeans. As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population groups of Native Americans.[^141] It reached [Lake Ontario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ontario "Lake Ontario") in 1636, and the lands of the [Iroquois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois "Iroquois") by 1679.[^142] [^143] During the 1770s smallpox killed at least 30% of the [West Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States "West Coast of the United States") Native Americans.[^144] The [1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1775%E2%80%9382_North_American_smallpox_epidemic "1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic") and the [1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1837_Great_Plains_smallpox_epidemic "1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic") brought devastation and drastic population depletion among the [Plains Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians "Plains Indians").[^145] [^146] In 1832 the federal government of the United States established a [smallpox vaccination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine "Smallpox vaccine") program for Native Americans (*The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832*).[^147]

The [Indigenous peoples in Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil "Indigenous peoples in Brazil") declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated three million [^148] to some 300,000 in 1997.[^149]

The [Spanish Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") and other Europeans re-introduced [horses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse "Horse") to the Americas. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.[^150] The reintroduction of the [horse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse "Horse"), extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on [Indigenous cultures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_culture "Horse culture") in several regions, such as those of the [Great Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians "Plains Indians"), the [Northwest Plateau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Northwest_Plateau "Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau"), the [Great Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Great_Basin "Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin"), [Aridoamerica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aridoamerica "Aridoamerica"), the [Gran Chaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco_people "Gran Chaco people") and the [Southern Cone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cone "Southern Cone"). By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture [game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_\(hunting\) "Game (hunting)"), such as [bison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison "Bison").

According to Erin McKenna and Scott L. Pratt, the Indigenous population of the Americas was 145 million in the late 15th and by the late 17th century, had been reduced to 15 million due to [epidemics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_disease_and_epidemics "Native American disease and epidemics"), wars, massacres, [mass rapes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_rapes "Mass rapes"), starvation, and enslavement.[^117][Wikimedia](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Maps_Terms_of_Use) | © [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

**Indigenous historical trauma** (IHT) is the trauma that can accumulate across generations and develop as a result of the historical ramifications of [colonization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization "Colonization") and is linked to mental and physical health hardships and population decline.[^151] IHT affects many different people in a multitude of ways because the Indigenous community and their history are diverse.

Many studies (such as Whitbeck et al., 2014;[^152] Brockie, 2012; Anastasio et al., 2016;[^153] Clark & Winterowd, 2012;[^154] Tucker et al., 2016) [^155] have evaluated the impact of IHT on health outcomes of Indigenous communities from the United States and Canada. IHT is a difficult term to standardize and measure because of the vast and variable diversity of Indigenous people and their communities. Therefore, it is an arduous task to assign an [operational definition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition "Operational definition") and systematically collect data when studying IHT. Many of the studies that incorporate IHT measure it in different ways, making it hard to compile data and review it holistically. This is an important point that provides context for the following studies that attempt to understand the relationship between IHT and potential adverse health impacts.

Some of the methodologies to measure IHT include a "Historical Losses Scale" (HLS), "Historical Losses Associated Symptoms Scale" (HLASS), and residential school ancestry studies.[^151]<sup><span title="Page / location: 23">: 23 </span></sup>  HLS uses a survey format that includes "12 kinds of historical losses", such as loss of language and loss of land and asks participants how often they think about those losses.[^151]<sup><span title="Page / location: 23">: 23 </span></sup>  The HLASS includes 12 emotional reactions, and asks participants how they feel when they think about these losses.[^151] Lastly, the [residential school](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system "Canadian Indian residential school system") ancestry studies ask respondents if their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, or "elders from their community" went to a residential school to understand if family or community history in residential schools is associated with negative health outcomes.[^151]<sup><span title="Page / location: 25">: 25 </span></sup>  In a comprehensive review of the research literature, Joseph Gone and colleagues [^151] compiled and compared outcomes for studies using these IHT measures relative to the health outcomes of Indigenous peoples. The study defined negative health outcomes to include such concepts as [anxiety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety "Anxiety"), [suicidal ideation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation "Suicidal ideation"), [suicide attempts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attempt "Suicide attempt"), [polysubstance abuse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysubstance_dependence "Polysubstance dependence"), [PTSD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder "Post-traumatic stress disorder"), [depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_\(mood\) "Depression (mood)"), [binge eating](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating "Binge eating"), anger, and sexual abuse.[^151]

The connection between IHT and health conditions is complicated because of the difficult nature of measuring IHT, the unknown directionality of IHT and health outcomes, and because the term *Indigenous people* used in the various samples comprises a huge population of individuals with drastically different experiences and histories. That being said some studies such as Bombay, Matheson, and Anisman (2014),[^156] Elias et al. (2012),[^157] and Pearce et al. (2008) [^158] found that Indigenous respondents with a connection to residential schools have more negative health outcomes (e.g., suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and depression) than those who did not have a connection to residential schools. Additionally, Indigenous respondents with higher HLS and HLASS scores had one or more negative health outcomes.[^151] While there are many studies [^153] [^159] [^154] [^160] [^155] that found an association between IHT and adverse health outcomes, scholars continue to suggest that it remains difficult to understand the impact of IHT. IHT needs to be systematically measured. Indigenous people also need to be understood in separate categories based on similar experiences, location, and background as opposed to being categorized as one monolithic group.[^151]

A representation of the domesticated plant species cultivated by Indigenous peoples have influenced the crops that were produced globally.

The ancient [mesoamerican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican "Mesoamerican") [engraving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving "Engraving") of [maize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") now on display at the [National Museum of Anthropology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Anthropology_\(Mexico\) "National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)") in [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico")

For thousands of years, Indigenous peoples domesticated, bred, and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute between 50% and 60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[^161] In certain cases, the Indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through [artificial selection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_selection "Artificial selection"), as with the domestication and breeding of [maize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") from wild *[teosinte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teosinte "Teosinte")* grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.

The South American highlands became a center of early agriculture. Genetic testing of the wide variety of [cultivars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar "Cultivar") and wild species suggests that the [potato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato "Potato") has a single origin in the area of southern [Peru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"),[^162] from a species in the *[Solanum brevicaule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_brevicaule "Solanum brevicaule")* complex. Over 99% of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south-central [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"),[^163] *Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum*, where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago.[^164] [^165] According to [Linda Newson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Newson "Linda Newson"), "It is clear that in pre-Columbian times some groups struggled to survive and often suffered food shortages and [famines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine "Famine"), while others enjoyed a varied and substantial diet." [^166]

Persistent drought around AD 850 coincided with the collapse of the [Classic Maya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Maya_collapse "Classic Maya collapse") civilization, and the famine of One Rabbit (AD 1454) was a major catastrophe in Mexico.[^167]

The [common bean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaseolus_vulgaris "Phaseolus vulgaris") is native to Mexico and Central America and later began to be cultivated in South America.

Indigenous peoples of North America began practicing [farming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farming "Farming") approximately 4,000 years ago, late in the [Archaic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_period_in_the_Americas "Archaic period in the Americas") period of North American cultures. Technology had advanced to the point where pottery had started to become common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic [Indigenous peoples began using fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire "Native American use of fire") in a controlled manner. They carried out the intentional burning of vegetation to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important both for food and for medicines.[^168]

In the [Mississippi River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River "Mississippi River") valley, Europeans noted that Native Americans managed groves of [nut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_\(fruit\) "Nut (fruit)") and [fruit trees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_tree "Fruit tree") not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields. They would have used [prescribed burning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn "Controlled burn") farther away, in forest and prairie areas.[^169]

The tomato (jitomate, in central Mexico) was later cultivated by the pre-Hispanic civilizations of Mexico.

Many crops first domesticated by Indigenous peoples are now produced and used globally, most notably [maize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") (or "corn") arguably the most important crop in the world.[^170] Other significant crops include [cassava](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava "Cassava"); [chia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_hispanica "Salvia hispanica"); [squash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita "Cucurbita") (pumpkins, zucchini, [marrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrow_\(vegetable\) "Marrow (vegetable)"), [acorn squash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_squash "Acorn squash"), [butternut squash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash "Butternut squash")); the [pinto bean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinto_bean "Pinto bean"), *[Phaseolus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaseolus "Phaseolus")* beans including most [common beans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bean "Common bean"), [tepary beans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaseolus_acutifolius "Phaseolus acutifolius"), and [lima beans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_bean "Lima bean"); [tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato "Tomato"); [potatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato "Potato"); [sweet potatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato "Sweet potato"); [avocados](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado "Avocado"); [peanuts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut "Peanut"); [cocoa beans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean "Cocoa bean") (used to make [chocolate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate "Chocolate")); [vanilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla "Vanilla"); [strawberries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberries "Strawberries"); [pineapples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple "Pineapple"); [peppers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum "Capsicum") (species and varieties of *[Capsicum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum "Capsicum")*, including [bell peppers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_pepper "Bell pepper"), [jalapeños](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalape%C3%B1o "Jalapeño"), [paprika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika "Paprika"), and [chili peppers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper "Chili pepper")); [sunflower seeds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sunflower "Common sunflower"); [rubber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber "Natural rubber"); [brazilwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paubrasilia "Paubrasilia"); [chicle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicle "Chicle"); [tobacco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco "Tobacco"); [coca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca "Coca"); [blueberries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry "Blueberry"), [cranberries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry "Cranberry"), and some species of [cotton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton "Cotton").

Studies of contemporary Indigenous environmental management—including agro-forestry practices among [Itza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itza_people "Itza people") [Maya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples "Maya peoples") in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the [Menominee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menominee "Menominee") of Wisconsin—suggest that longstanding "sacred values" may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.[^171]

Numerous [Native American dog breeds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_dogs "Native American dogs") have been used by the people of the Americas, such as the [Canadian Eskimo dog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Eskimo_Dog "Canadian Eskimo Dog"), the [Carolina dog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Dog "Carolina Dog"), and the [Chihuahua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_\(dog\) "Chihuahua (dog)"). Some [Indigenous peoples in the Great Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians "Plains Indians") used dogs for pulling [travois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travois "Travois"), while others like the [Tahltan bear dog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahltan_Bear_Dog "Tahltan Bear Dog") were bred to hunt larger game. Some Andean cultures also bred the [Chiribaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiribaya_Dog "Chiribaya Dog") to herd [llamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama "Llama"). The vast majority of indigenous dog breeds in the Americas went extinct, due to being replaced by dogs of European origin.[^172]

The [Fuegian dog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuegian_dog "Fuegian dog") was a domesticated variation of the [culpeo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeo "Culpeo") that was raised by [several cultures in Tierra del Fuego](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuegians "Fuegians"), like the [Selkʼnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selk%CA%BCnam_people "Selkʼnam people") and the [Yahgan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahgan_people "Yahgan people").[^173] It was exterminated by Argentine and Chilean settlers, due to supposedly posing as a threat to livestock.[^174]

Several bird species, such as [turkeys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_turkey "Domestic turkey"), [Muscovy ducks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_duck "Muscovy duck"), [Puna ibis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puna_ibis "Puna ibis"), and [neotropic cormorants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropic_cormorant "Neotropic cormorant") were domesticated by various peoples in Mesoamerica and South America to be used for poultry.

In the Andean region, Indigenous peoples domesticated llamas and [alpacas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpaca "Alpaca") to produce fiber and meat. The llama was the only [beast of burden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_animal "Pack animal") in the Americas before European colonization.

[Guinea pigs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig "Guinea pig") were domesticated from wild [cavies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavia "Cavia") to be raised for meat consumption in the Andean region. Guinea pigs are now widely raised in Western society as household pets.

In [Oasisamerica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasisamerica "Oasisamerica"), several cultures raised [scarlet macaws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_macaws "Scarlet macaws") imported from [Mesoamerica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica "Mesoamerica") for their feathers.[^175] [^176]

In the [Maya civilization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization"), [stingless bees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingless_bee "Stingless bee") were [domesticated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping "Beekeeping") to produce [balché](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balch%C3%A9 "Balché").[^177]

[Cochineal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal "Cochineal") were harvested by Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations for coloring fabrics via [carminic acid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carminic_acid "Carminic acid").[^178] [^179] [^180]

Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where distinct ethnic groups adopt shared cultural traits, similar technologies, and social organizations. An example of such a [cultural area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_area "Cultural area") is [Mesoamerica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica "Mesoamerica"), where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [nomadic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad "Nomad") hunter-gatherers based primarily on bison hunting.

The major indigenous [language families](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_South_America "Indigenous languages of South America") of much of present-day [South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") and [Panama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama "Panama")

Indigenous languages in North America have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the various nations may be said to center. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area. Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the [Anishinaabe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language "Ojibwe language") and [Lenape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape "Lenape") nations.[^181]

[Maya glyphs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script "Maya script") in stucco now on display at Museo de sitio in [Palenque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palenque "Palenque"), Mexico

Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, pre-Columbian cultures in [Mesoamerica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica "Mesoamerica") developed several [Indigenous writing systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_writing_systems "Mesoamerican writing systems") (independent of any influence from the writing systems that existed in other parts of the world). The [Cascajal Block](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascajal_Block "Cascajal Block") is perhaps the earliest-known example in the Americas of what may be an extensive written text. The [Olmec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec "Olmec") hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated (from ceramic shards found in the same context) to approximately 900 BCE which is around the same time that the Olmec occupation of [San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Lorenzo_Tenochtitl%C3%A1n "San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán") began to weaken.[^182]

The [Maya writing system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script "Maya script") was [logosyllabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logosyllabic "Logosyllabic") (a combination of [phonetic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic "Phonetic") [syllabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary") symbols and [logograms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram "Logogram")). It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to have completely represented the [spoken language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language "Spoken language") of its community. It has more than a thousand different [glyphs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph"), but a few are variations on the same sign or have the same meaning, many appear only rarely or in particular localities, no more than about five hundred were in use in any given time, and, of those, it seems only about two hundred (including variations) represented a particular phoneme or syllable.[^183] [^184] [^185]

The [Zapotec writing system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_script "Zapotec script"), one of the earliest in the Americas,[^186] was [logographic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram "Logogram") and presumably [syllabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary").[^186] There are remnants of Zapotec writing in inscriptions on some of the monumental architecture of the period, but so few inscriptions are extant that it is difficult to fully describe the writing system. The oldest example of the Zapotec script, dating from around 600 BCE, is on a monument that was discovered in [San José Mogote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Mogote "San José Mogote").[^187]

[Aztec codices](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_codices "Aztec codices") (singular *[codex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex "Codex")*) are books that were written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [Aztecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec"). These codices are some of the best [primary sources](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sources "Primary sources") for descriptions of [Aztec culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_society "Aztec society"). The pre-Columbian codices are largely pictorial; they do not contain symbols that represent spoken or written language.[^188] By contrast, colonial-era codices contain not only [Aztec pictograms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_writing "Aztec writing"), but also writing that uses the [Latin alphabet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") in several languages: [Classical Nahuatl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Nahuatl "Classical Nahuatl"), Spanish, and occasionally [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin").

Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught Indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages using Latin letters, and there are a large number of local-level documents in [Nahuatl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl "Nahuatl"), [Zapotec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotecan_languages "Zapotecan languages"), [Mixtec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec "Mixtec"), and Yucatec [Maya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_languages "Mayan languages") from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught Indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.[^189] The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [New Philology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Philology_\(Latin_America\) "New Philology (Latin America)") to write histories of Indigenous peoples from Indigenous viewpoints.[^190]

The [Wiigwaasabak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiigwaasabak "Wiigwaasabak"), [birch bark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_bark "Birch bark") scrolls on which the [Ojibwa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwa "Ojibwa") ([Anishinaabe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe "Anishinaabe")) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%27kmaq_hieroglyphic_writing "Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing").

Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply **syllabics**, is a family of [abugidas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida "Abugida") used to write some Indigenous languages of the [Algonquian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages "Algonquian languages"), [Inuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo%E2%80%93Aleut_languages "Eskimo–Aleut languages"), and [Athabaskan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabaskan_languages "Athabaskan languages") language families.

[Indigenous music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_music "Native American music") can vary between cultures, however, there are significant commonalities. Traditional music often centers around [drumming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum "Drum") and singing. [Rattles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattle_\(percussion_instrument\) "Rattle (percussion instrument)"), [clapper sticks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapper_stick "Clapper stick"), and rasps are also popular percussive instruments, both historically and in contemporary cultures. [Flutes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute "Flute") are made of river cane, cedar, and other woods. The [Apache](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache "Apache") have a type of [fiddle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_fiddle "Apache fiddle"), and [fiddles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddle "Fiddle") are also found many [First Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada "First Nations in Canada") and [Métis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis "Métis") cultures.

The music of the Indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America, like that of the North American cultures, tends to be spiritual ceremonies. It traditionally includes a large variety of percussion and [wind instruments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_instrument "Wind instrument") such as drums, flutes, sea shells (used as trumpets), and "rain" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE); this jar was decorated with imagery depicting a stringed musical instrument, which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas before the introduction of European [musical instruments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument "Musical instrument"); when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.[^191]

[Visual arts by Indigenous peoples of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts_by_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Visual arts by Indigenous peoples of the Americas") comprise a major category in the world [art collection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_\(museum\) "Collection (museum)"). Contributions include [pottery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_pottery "Native American pottery"), [paintings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting "Painting"), [jewelry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery "Jewellery"), [weavings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving "Weaving"), [sculptures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture "Sculpture"), [basketry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketry "Basketry"), [carvings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carving "wikt:carving"), and [beadwork](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadwork "Beadwork").[^192] Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives [^193] to profit from the cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the [Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Arts_and_Crafts_Act_of_1990 "Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990"), requiring artists to prove that they were enrolled in a [state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_recognized_tribes "State recognized tribes") or [federally recognized tribe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_recognized_tribe "Federally recognized tribe"). To support the ongoing practice of [American Indian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States"), [Alaska Native](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives "Alaska Natives"), and [Native Hawaiian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians "Native Hawaiians") arts and cultures in the United States,[^194] the Ford Foundation, arts advocates, and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.[^195] [^196]

After the entry of the Spaniards, the process of spiritual conquest was favored, among other things, by the [liturgical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical "Liturgical") musical service to which the natives, whose musical gifts came to surprise the missionaries, were integrated. The musical gifts of the natives were of such magnitude that they soon learned the rules of counterpoint and [polyphony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony "Polyphony") and even the virtuous handling of the instruments. This helped to ensure that it was not necessary to bring more musicians from Spain, which significantly annoyed the clergy.[^197]

The solution that was proposed was not to employ but a certain number of Indigenous people in the musical service, not to teach them counterpoint, not to allow them to play certain instruments ([brass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_instrument "Brass instrument") breaths, for example, in [Oaxaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca"), Mexico) and, finally, not to import more instruments so that the Indigenous people would not have access to them. The latter was not an obstacle to the musical enjoyment of the natives, who experienced the making of instruments, particularly rubbed strings ([violins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin "Violin") and [double basses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass "Double bass")) or plucked (third). It is there where we can find the origin of what is now called traditional music whose instruments have their tuning and a typical Western structure.[^198]

[Indigenous peoples in Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada "Indigenous peoples in Canada") (also known as Aboriginals) [^200] are the Indigenous peoples within the boundaries of [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"). They comprise the [First Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada "First Nations in Canada"),[^201] [Inuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit "Inuit"),[^202] and [Métis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis#M%C3%A9tis_people_in_Canada "Métis"),[^203] representing roughly 5.0% of the total [Canadian population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_of_Canada "Population of Canada"). There are over 600 recognized [First Nations governments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_First_Nations_peoples_in_Canada "List of First Nations peoples in Canada") or [bands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_government "Band government") with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music.[^204] [^205]

[Old Crow Flats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Crow_Flats "Old Crow Flats") and [Bluefish Caves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluefish_Caves "Bluefish Caves") are some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Canada.[^206] The characteristics of Indigenous cultures in Canada prior to European colonization included permanent settlements,[^207] agriculture,[^208] civic and ceremonial architecture,[^209] complex [societal hierarchies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy"), and [trading networks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade "Trade").[^210] Métis nations of mixed ancestry originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married Europeans, primarily the [French colonizers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonization_of_the_Americas "French colonization of the Americas").[^211] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting Europeans during the [North American fur trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_fur_trade "North American fur trade").

Various [Aboriginal laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_law "Canadian Aboriginal law"), [treaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty#Canada "Treaty"), and legislation have been enacted between European immigrants and Indigenous groups across Canada. The impact of [settler colonialism in Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler_colonialism_in_Canada "Settler colonialism in Canada") can be seen in its culture, history, politics, laws, and legislatures.[^212] This led to the systematic abolishment of Indigenous languages, traditions, religion and the degradation of Indigenous communities that has been described as a [genocide of Indigenous peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_genocide_of_Indigenous_peoples "Canadian genocide of Indigenous peoples").[^213]

The modern Indigenous right to [self-government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance "Self-governance") provides for [Indigenous self-government in Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_self-government_in_Canada "Indigenous self-government in Canada") and the management of their historical, cultural, political, health care and economic control aspects within Indigenous communities. [National Indigenous Peoples Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Indigenous_Peoples_Day "National Indigenous Peoples Day") recognizes the vast cultures and contributions of Indigenous peoples to the [history of Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Canada "History of Canada").[^214] First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples of all backgrounds have become [prominent figures and have served as role models in the Indigenous community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Canadian_personalities "Indigenous Canadian personalities") and help to shape the [Canadian cultural identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Canada "Culture of Canada").[^215]

Approximately 89 percent of Greenland's population of 57,695 is Greenlandic [Inuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit "Inuit"), or 51,349 people as of 2012.[^36] [^217] [Ethnographically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnographically "Ethnographically"), they consist of three major groups:

The territory of modern-day Mexico was home to numerous Indigenous civilizations before the arrival of the Spanish *[conquistadores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador "Conquistador")*: The [Olmecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec "Olmec"), who flourished from between 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE in the coastal regions of the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico"); the [Zapotecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_peoples "Zapotec peoples") and the [Mixtecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec "Mixtec"), who held sway in the mountains of [Oaxaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca") and the [Isthmus of Tehuantepec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec "Isthmus of Tehuantepec"); the [Maya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization") in the [Yucatán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n "Yucatán") (and into neighboring areas of contemporary [Central America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America")); the [Purépecha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9pecha_people "Purépecha people") in present-day [Michoacán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac%C3%A1n "Michoacán") and surrounding areas, and the [Aztecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec") / [Mexica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexica "Mexica"), who, from their central capital at [Tenochtitlan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenochtitlan "Tenochtitlan"), dominated much of the center and south of the country (and the non-Aztec inhabitants of those areas) when [Hernán Cortés](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s "Hernán Cortés") first landed at [Veracruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz_\(city\) "Veracruz (city)").

In contrast to what was the general rule in the rest of North America, the history of the colony of [New Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain "New Spain") was one of racial intermingling (*mestizaje*). *[Mestizos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo "Mestizo")*, which in Mexico designate people who do not identify culturally with any Indigenous grouping, quickly came to account for a majority of the colony's population. Today, [Mestizos in Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizos_in_Mexico "Mestizos in Mexico") of mixed Indigenous and European ancestry (with a minor African contribution) are still a majority of the population. Genetic studies vary over whether Indigenous or European ancestry predominates in the Mexican Mestizo population.[^218] [^219] In the 2020 [INEGI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Statistics_and_Geography "National Institute of Statistics and Geography") census, 23.2 million people (19.4% of the Mexican population aged 3 years and older) self-identified as Indigenous.[^2] Somewhat contradictorily, in the same 2020 census, 11.8 million people (9.3% of the Mexican population) were determined to be Indigenous by the Mexican government based on the language spoken in their households.[^1] The Indigenous population is distributed throughout the territory of Mexico but is especially concentrated in the [Sierra Madre del Sur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_del_Sur "Sierra Madre del Sur"), the [Yucatán Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula "Yucatán Peninsula"), and the most remote and difficult-to-access areas, such as the [Sierra Madre Oriental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Oriental "Sierra Madre Oriental"), the [Sierra Madre Occidental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Occidental "Sierra Madre Occidental"), and neighboring areas.[^220] The [CDI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Development_of_Indigenous_Peoples "National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples") identifies 62 Indigenous groups in Mexico, each with a unique language.[^221] [^222]

In the states of [Chiapas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas "Chiapas") and [Oaxaca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca") and the interior of the [Yucatán Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula "Yucatán Peninsula"), a large amount of the population is of Indigenous descent with the largest ethnic group being Maya with a population of 900,000.[^223] Large Indigenous minorities, including [Aztecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs "Aztecs") or [Nahua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuas "Nahuas"), [Purépechas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9pecha_people "Purépecha people"), [Mazahua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazahua_people "Mazahua people"), [Otomi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otomi_people "Otomi people"), and [Mixtecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec "Mixtec") are also present in the central regions of Mexico. In the [Northern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mexico "Northern Mexico") and [Bajio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baj%C3%ADo "Bajío") regions of Mexico, Indigenous people are a small minority.

The [General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_General_de_Derechos_Ling%C3%BC%C3%ADsticos_de_los_Pueblos_Ind%C3%ADgenas "Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas") grants all Indigenous languages spoken in Mexico, regardless of the number of speakers, the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken, and Indigenous peoples are entitled to request some [public services](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_services "Public services") and documents in their native languages.[^224] Along with Spanish, the law has granted them—more than 60 languages—the status of "national languages". The law includes all Indigenous languages of the Americas regardless of origin; that is, it includes the Indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory. The [National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Development_of_Indigenous_Peoples "National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples") recognizes the language of the [Kickapoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickapoo_people "Kickapoo people"), who immigrated from the United States [^225] and recognizes the languages of the Indigenous refugees from Guatemala.[^226] The Mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and [secondary education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education "Secondary education") in some Indigenous rural communities. Nonetheless, of the Indigenous peoples in Mexico, 93% are either native speakers or bilingual second-language speakers of Spanish with only about 62.4% of them (or 5.4% of the country's population) speaking an Indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak Spanish (0.7% of the country's population).[^227]

The Indigenous peoples in Mexico have the right of free determination under the second article of the constitution. According to this article, the Indigenous peoples are granted:[^228]

- the right to decide the internal forms of social, economic, political, and cultural organization;
- the right to apply their normative systems of regulation as long as [human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") and [gender equality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality "Gender equality") are respected;
- the right to preserve and enrich their languages and cultures;
- the right to elect representatives before the [municipal council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_council "Municipal council") in which their territories are located;

amongst other rights.

Indigenous peoples in what is now the [contiguous United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States "Contiguous United States"), including their descendants, were commonly called American Indians, or simply Indians domestically and since the late 20th century the term Native American came into [common use](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_name_controversy#%22Native_American%22_\(since_the_1960s\) "Native American name controversy"). In Alaska, Indigenous peoples belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the [St. Lawrence Island Yupik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_Island_Yupik "St. Lawrence Island Yupik"), [Iñupiat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C3%B1upiat "Iñupiat"), [Athabaskan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaskan_Athabaskans "Alaskan Athabaskans"), [Yup'ik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yup%27ik "Yup'ik"), [Cup'ik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup%27ik "Cup'ik"), [Unangax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unangax "Unangax"), [Alutiiq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alutiiq "Alutiiq"), [Eyak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyak "Eyak"), [Haida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_people "Haida people"), [Tsimshian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsimshian "Tsimshian"), and [Tlingit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlingit "Tlingit"),[^229] and are collectively called [Alaska Natives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives "Alaska Natives"). They include Native American peoples as well as Inuit, who are distinct but occupy areas of the region.

The United States has authority over Indigenous [Polynesian people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesia "Polynesia"), which include [Hawaiians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians "Native Hawaiians"), [Marshallese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshallese_people "Marshallese people") (Micronesian), and [Samoan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoan_people "Samoan people"); politically they are classified as [Pacific Islander Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islander_Americans "Pacific Islander Americans"). They are geographically, genetically, and culturally distinct from Indigenous peoples of the mainland continents of the Americas.

In the 2020 census 2.9% of the U.S. population claimed to have some degree of Native American heritage. When answering a question about racial background, 3.7 million people identified solely as "American Indian or Alaska Native", while another 5.9 million did so in combination with other races.[^230] [Aztecs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs "Aztecs") were the largest single Native American group in the 2020 census, while [Cherokee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee "Cherokee") was the largest group in combination with any other race.[^231] Tribes have established their criteria for membership, which are often based on [blood quantum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_quantum "Blood quantum"), [lineal descent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_descent "Lineal descent"), or residency. A minority of Native Americans live in land units called [Indian reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation").

Some California and Southwestern tribes, such as the [Kumeyaay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumeyaay "Kumeyaay"), [Cocopa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocopa "Cocopa"), [Pascua Yaqui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascua_Yaqui "Pascua Yaqui"), [Tohono O'odham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohono_O%27odham "Tohono O'odham"), and [Apache](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache "Apache"), span both sides of the US–Mexican border. By treaty, [Haudenosaunee people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois "Iroquois") have the legal right to freely cross the US–Canada border. [Athabascan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabaskan_languages "Athabaskan languages"), [Tlingit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlingit "Tlingit"), [Haida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_people "Haida people"), [Tsimshian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsimshian_people "Tsimshian people"), [Iñupiat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inupiat_people "Inupiat people"), [Blackfeet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfoot_Confederacy "Blackfoot Confederacy"), [Nakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakota "Nakota"), [Cree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cree "Cree"), [Anishinaabe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe "Anishinaabe"), [Huron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people "Wyandot people"), [Lenape](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape "Lenape"), [Mi'kmaq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%27kmaq_people "Mi'kmaq people"), [Penobscot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_people "Penobscot people"), and Haudenosaunee, among others, live in both Canada and the United States, whose international border intersects their common cultural territory.

Mestizos (mixed European-Indigenous) number about 34% of the population; unmixed [Maya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples "Maya peoples") make up another 10.6% ([Kekchi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%27eqchi%27_people "Q'eqchi' people"), [Mopan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mopan_people "Mopan people"), and [Yucatec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec "Yucatec")). The [Garifuna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garifuna_people "Garifuna people"), who came to Belize in the 19th century from [Saint Vincent and the Grenadines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"), have [mixed African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambo "Zambo"), [Carib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Caribs "Island Caribs"), and [Arawak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak "Arawak") ancestry and make up another 6% of the population.[^232]

There are over 114,000 inhabitants of Native American origins, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: [Quitirrisí](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quitirris%C3%AD "Quitirrisí") (In the Central Valley), [Matambú](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matamb%C3%BA "Matambú") or [Chorotega](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorotega_people "Chorotega people") (Guanacaste), [Maleku](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleku_people "Maleku people") (Northern Alajuela), [Bribri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribri_people "Bribri people") (Southern Atlantic), [Cabécar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab%C3%A9car_people "Cabécar people") (Cordillera de Talamanca), [Boruca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruca_people "Boruca people") (Southern Costa Rica) and [Ngäbe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%A4be_people "Ngäbe people") (Southern Costa Rica along the Panamá border).

These native groups are characterized by their work in wood, like masks, drums, and other artistic figures, as well as fabrics made of cotton.

Their subsistence is based on agriculture, having corn, beans, and plantains as the main crops.

Estimates for El Salvador's Indigenous population vary. The last time a reported census had an Indigenous ethnic option was in 2007, which estimated that 0.23% of the population identified as Indigenous.[^26] Historically, estimates have claimed higher amounts. A 1930 census stated that 5.6% were Indigenous.[^233] By the mid-20th century, there may have been as much as 20% (or 400,000) that would qualify as "Indigenous". Another estimate stated that by the late 1980s, 10% of the population was Indigenous, and another 89% was mestizo (or people of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry).[^234]

Much of [El Salvador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador") was home to various Indigenous groups like the [Pipil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipil_people "Pipil people"), the [Lenca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenca_people "Lenca people"), Mayas (Chorti and Poqomam), Chorotegas, and [Xincas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xincas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Xincas (page does not exist)"). The Pipil lived in western [El Salvador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador"), spoke [Nawat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuat "Nahuat"), and had many settlements there, most notably [Cuzcatlan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuzcatlan "Cuzcatlan"). The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [fertile land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_soil "Fertile soil") that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [El Salvador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador") as they had in other lands like [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") or Mexico, but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American Indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [Pedro de Alvarado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Alvarado "Pedro de Alvarado") along with their Indigenous allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Indigenous allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the mestizo population that would make up the vast majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other Indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like [Izalco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izalco "Izalco"), [Panchimalco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchimalco "Panchimalco"), [Sacacoyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacacoyo "Sacacoyo"), and [Nahuizalco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuizalco "Nahuizalco").

[Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") has one of the largest Indigenous populations in [Central America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America"), with approximately 43.6% of the population considering themselves Indigenous.[^235] The [Indigenous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples") demographic portion of Guatemala's population consists of a majority of Maya groups and one non-Maya group. The Mayan language-speaking portion makes up 29.7% of the population and is distributed into 23 groups namely [Q'eqchi'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%CA%BCeqchi%CA%BC "Qʼeqchiʼ") 8.3%, [K'iche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC_people "Kʼicheʼ people") 7.8%, [Mam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mam_people "Mam people") 4.4%, [Kaqchikel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqchikel_people "Kaqchikel people") 3%, Q'anjob'al 1.2%, Poqomchi' 1%, and Other 4%.[^235] The non-Maya group consists of the [Xinca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinca_people "Xinca people") who are another set of Indigenous people making up 1.8% of the population.[^235] Other sources indicate that between 50% and 60% of the population could be Indigenous because part of the Mestizo population is predominantly Indigenous.

The Maya peoples cover a vast geographic area throughout Central America and expand beyond Guatemala into other countries. One could find vast groups of Maya people in Boca Costa, in the Southern portions of Guatemala, as well as the Western Highlands living together in close communities.[^236] Within these communities and outside of them, around 23 [Indigenous languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_language "Indigenous language") (or [Native American Indigenous languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas "Indigenous languages of the Americas")) are spoken as a first language. Of these 23 languages, they only received official recognition by the Government in 2003 under the Law of National Languages.[^235] The Law on National Languages recognizes 23 Indigenous languages including Xinca, enforcing that public and government institutions not only translate but also provide services in said languages.[^237] It would provide services in [Cakchiquel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqchikel_language "Kaqchikel language"), [Garifuna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garifuna_language "Garifuna language"), [Kekchi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%CA%BCeqchi%CA%BC_language "Qʼeqchiʼ language"), [Mam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mam_language "Mam language"), [Quiche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC_language "Kʼicheʼ language"), and [Xinca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xincan_languages "Xincan languages").[^238]

The Law of National Languages has been an effort to grant and protect Indigenous peoples' rights not afforded to them previously. Along with the Law of National Languages passed in 2003, in 1996 the Guatemalan Constitutional Court had ratified the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.[^239] The [ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization"), is also known as Convention 169. Which is the only International Law regarding Indigenous peoples that Independent countries can adopt. The convention establishes that governments like Guatemala must consult with Indigenous groups before any projects occur on tribal lands.[^240]

About 5 percent of the population is of full-blooded Indigenous descent, but as much as 80 percent of Hondurans are [mestizo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo "Mestizo") or part-Indigenous with European admixture, and about 10 percent are of Indigenous or [African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Hondurans "Afro-Hondurans") descent.[^241] The largest concentrations of [Indigenous communities in Honduras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Honduras "Indigenous peoples of Honduras") are in the westernmost areas facing Guatemala and along the coast of the [Caribbean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea "Caribbean Sea"), as well as on the border with Nicaragua.[^241] The majority of Indigenous people are [Lencas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenca_people "Lenca people"), [Miskitos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_people "Miskito people") to the east, [Mayas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples "Maya peoples"), [Pech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pech_people "Pech people"), [Sumos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo_people "Sumo people"), and [Tolupan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolupan_people "Tolupan people").[^241]

About 5 percent of the [Nicaraguan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan "Nicaraguan") population is Indigenous. The largest Indigenous group in Nicaragua is the [Miskito people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_people "Miskito people"). Their territory extended from [Cabo Camarón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_Camar%C3%B3n "Cabo Camarón"), Honduras, to [La Cruz de Rio Grande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cruz_de_R%C3%ADo_Grande "La Cruz de Río Grande"), Nicaragua along the [Mosquito Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_Coast "Mosquito Coast"). There is a native [Miskito language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_language "Miskito language"), but large numbers speak [Miskito Coast Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_Coast_Creole "Miskito Coast Creole"), Spanish, [Rama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama_language "Rama language"), and other languages. Their use of [Creole English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-based_creole_languages "English-based creole languages") came about through frequent contact with the British, who colonized the area. Many Miskitos are Christians. Traditional Miskito society was highly structured, politically and otherwise. It had a king, but he did not have total power. Instead, the power was split between himself, a [Miskito Governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_Governor "Miskito Governor"), a [Miskito General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_General "Miskito General"), and by the 1750s, a [Miskito Admiral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_Admiral "Miskito Admiral"). Historical information on Miskito kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi- [mythical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology").

Another major Indigenous culture in eastern Nicaragua is the [Mayangna (or Sumu) people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo_people "Sumo people"), counting some 10,000 people.[^242] A smaller Indigenous culture in southeastern Nicaragua is the [Rama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama_people "Rama people").

Other Indigenous groups in Nicaragua are located in the central, northern, and Pacific areas and they are self-identified as follows: [Chorotega](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorotega_people "Chorotega people"), [Cacaopera (or Matagalpa)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacaopera_people "Cacaopera people"), [Xiu-Subtiaba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtiaba_language "Subtiaba language"), and [Nicarao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicarao_people "Nicarao people").[^243]

**Indigenous peoples of Panama**, or **Native Panamanians**, are the native peoples of [Panama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama "Panama"). As of the 2023 census, Indigenous peoples constitute 17.2% of Panama's population of 4.5 million, totaling just over 698,000 individuals. The [Ngäbe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%A4be "Ngäbe") and [Buglé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokota_people "Bokota people") comprise half of the Indigenous peoples of Panama.[^244]

Many of the Indigenous Peoples live on *[comarca indígenas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comarca_ind%C3%ADgena "Comarca indígena")*,[^245] which are administrative regions for areas with substantial [Indigenous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerindian "Amerindian") populations. Three *comarcas* ([Comarca Emberá-Wounaan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comarca_Ember%C3%A1-Wounaan "Comarca Emberá-Wounaan"), [Guna Yala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_Yala "Guna Yala"), [Ngäbe-Buglé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%A4be-Bugl%C3%A9 "Ngäbe-Buglé")) exist as equivalent to a province, with two smaller *comarcas* (Guna de Madugandí and [Guna de Wargandí](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_de_Wargand%C3%AD "Guna de Wargandí")) subordinate to a province and considered equivalent to a *[corregimiento](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corregimiento "Corregimiento")* (municipality).

In 2005, the Indigenous population living in Argentina (known as *pueblos originarios*) numbered about 600,329 (1.6% of the total population); this figure includes 457,363 people who self-identified as belonging to an Indigenous ethnic group and 142,966 who identified themselves as first-generation descendants of an Indigenous people.[^246] The ten most populous Indigenous peoples are the [Mapuche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche "Mapuche") (113,680 people), the [Kolla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolla_people "Kolla people") (70,505), the [Toba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_people "Toba people") (69,452), the [Guaraní](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people "Guaraní people") (68,454), the [Wichi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wich%C3%AD_people "Wichí people") (40,036), the [Diaguita](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaguita "Diaguita") – [Calchaquí](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calchaqu%C3%AD "Calchaquí") (31,753), the [Mocoví](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocov%C3%AD_people "Mocoví people") (15,837), the [Huarpe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huarpe "Huarpe") (14,633), the [Comechingón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comeching%C3%B3n "Comechingón") (10,863) and the [Tehuelche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people "Tehuelche people") (10,590). Minor but important peoples are the [Quechua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua_people "Quechua people") (6,739), the [Charrúa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charr%C3%BAa "Charrúa") (4,511), the [Pilagá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilag%C3%A1 "Pilagá") (4,465), the Chané (4,376), and the Chorote (2,613). The [Selkʼnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selk%CA%BCnam_people "Selkʼnam people") (Ona) people are now virtually extinct in its pure form. The languages of the Diaguita, Tehuelche, and Selkʼnam nations have become extinct or virtually extinct: the Cacán language (spoken by Diaguitas) in the 18th century and the Selkʼnam language in the 20th century; one Tehuelche language (Southern Tehuelche) is still spoken by a handful of elderly people.

In Bolivia, the 2012 National Census reported that 41% of residents over the age of 15 are of Indigenous origin. Some 3.7% report growing up with an Indigenous mother tongue but do not identify as Indigenous.[^247] When both of these categories are totaled, and children under 15, some 66.4% of Bolivia's population was recorded as Indigenous in the 2001 Census.[^248]

The 2021 National Census, recognizes 38 cultures, each with its language, as part of a pluri-national state. Some groups, including [CONAMAQ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONAMAQ "CONAMAQ") (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu), draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of 50 Indigenous peoples native to Bolivia.

The largest Indigenous ethnic groups are [Quechua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuas "Quechuas"), about 2.5 million people; [Aymara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_people "Aymara people"), 2 million; [Chiquitano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiquitano_people "Chiquitano people"), 181,000; [Guaraní](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani_people "Guarani people"), 126,000; and [Mojeño](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moje%C3%B1o "Mojeño"), 69,000. Some 124,000 belong to smaller Indigenous groups.[^249] The [Constitution of Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Bolivia "Constitution of Bolivia"), enacted in 2009, recognizes 36 cultures, each with its language, as part of a pluri-national state. Some groups, including [CONAMAQ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONAMAQ "CONAMAQ") (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu), draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of 50 Indigenous peoples native to Bolivia.

Large numbers of Bolivian highland [peasants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant "Peasant") retained Indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of "empowered caciques" to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.[^250] While the National Revolutionary Movement government began in 1952 and discouraged people identifying as Indigenous (reclassifying rural people as *campesinos*, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the [Katarista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katarismo "Katarismo") movement beginning in the 1970s.[^251] Many lowland Indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the [CIDOB confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDOB_Confederation "CIDOB Confederation"). That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the [ILO Convention 169](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILO_Convention_169 "ILO Convention 169") and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official titles to Indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted "grassroots territorial organizations;" these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas.

Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages. The constitutional reform in 1997 recognized Bolivia as a multi-lingual, pluri-ethnic society and introduced [education reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_reform "Education reform"). In 2005, for the first time in the country's history, an Indigenous Aymara, [Evo Morales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales "Evo Morales"), was elected as president.

Morales began work on his "Indigenous autonomy" policy, which he launched in the eastern lowlands [department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_Bolivia "Departments of Bolivia") on 3 August 2009. Bolivia was the first nation in the history of South America to affirm the right of Indigenous people to self-government.[^252] Speaking in [Santa Cruz Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Department_\(Bolivia\) "Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)"), the President called it "a historic day for the peasant and Indigenous movement", saying that, though he might make errors, he would "never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people".[^252] A vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in December 2009, at the same time as general elections to office. The issue divided the country.[^253]

At that time, Indigenous peoples voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy: five departments that had not already done so voted for it;[^254] [^255] as did [Gran Chaco Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco_Province "Gran Chaco Province") in Taríja, for regional autonomy;[^256] and 11 of 12 municipalities that had referendums on this issue.[^254]

An Indigenous [Terena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terena_people "Terena people") man from present-day [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil")

[Indigenous peoples of Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Brazil "Indigenous peoples of Brazil") make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 817,000 people, but millions of Brazilians are mestizo or have some Indigenous ancestry.[^257] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although in the 21st century, the majority of them live in [Indigenous territories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_territory_\(Brazil\) "Indigenous territory (Brazil)") in the North and Center-Western parts of the country. On 18 January 2007, [Fundação Nacional do Índio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Nacional_do_%C3%8Dndio "Fundação Nacional do Índio") (FUNAI) reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different [uncontacted tribes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples "Uncontacted peoples") in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. Brazil is now the nation that has the largest number of uncontacted tribes, and the island of [New Guinea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea "New Guinea") is second.[^257]

*The Washington Post* reported in 2007, "As has been proved in the past when uncontacted tribes are introduced to other populations and the microbes they carry, maladies as simple as the common cold can be deadly. In the 1970s, 185 members of the [Panara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panar%C3%A1_people "Panará people") tribe died within two years of discovery after contracting such diseases as flu and chickenpox, leaving only 69 survivors."

A Mapuche man and woman; the Mapuche make up about 85% of Indigenous population that live in Chile.

According to the 2012 Census, 10% of the Chilean population, including the [Rapa Nui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapa_Nui_people "Rapa Nui people") (a [Polynesian people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesians "Polynesians")) of [Easter Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island "Easter Island"), was Indigenous, although most show varying degrees of mixed heritage.[^259] Many are descendants of the [Mapuche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche "Mapuche") and live in [Santiago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago,_Chile "Santiago, Chile"), [Araucanía](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucan%C3%ADa_Region "Araucanía Region"), and [Los Lagos Region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Lagos_Region "Los Lagos Region"). The Mapuche successfully fought off defeat in the first 300–350 years of Spanish rule during the [Arauco War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arauco_War "Arauco War"). Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean state decided to occupy their lands. During the [Occupation of Araucanía](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Araucan%C3%ADa "Occupation of Araucanía"), the Mapuche surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s. Their land was opened to settlement by Chileans and Europeans. [Conflict over Mapuche land rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche_conflict "Mapuche conflict") continues to the present.

Other groups include the [Aymara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_people "Aymara people"), the majority of whom live in Bolivia and Peru, with smaller numbers in the [Arica-Parinacota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica-Parinacota_Region "Arica-Parinacota Region") and [Tarapacá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarapac%C3%A1_Region "Tarapacá Region") regions, and the [Atacama people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_people "Atacama people") (*Atacameños*), who reside mainly in [El Loa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Loa "El Loa").

One of the influences is the [Muisca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_people "Muisca people") culture, a subset of the larger [Chibcha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibcha "Chibcha") [ethnic group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group"), famous for their use of [gold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), which led to the legend of *[El Dorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado "El Dorado")*. At the time of the [Spanish conquest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest "Spanish conquest"), the Muisca were the largest Indigenous civilization geographically between the [Inca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire "Inca Empire") and the [Aztec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire "Aztec Empire") empires.

[Ecuador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador") was the site of many Indigenous cultures, and civilizations of different proportions. An early sedentary culture, known as the [Valdivia culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdivia_culture "Valdivia culture"), developed in the coastal region, while the [Caras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caras_\(tribe\) "Caras (tribe)") and the [Quitus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quitu "Quitu") unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The [Cañaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C3%B1ari "Cañari") near [Cuenca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuenca,_Ecuador "Cuenca, Ecuador") were the most advanced, and most feared by the [Inca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca "Inca"), due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architectural remains were later destroyed by the Spaniards and the Incas.

Between 55% and 65% of Ecuador's population consists of Mestizos of mixed Indigenous and European ancestry while Indigenous people comprise about 25%.[^262] Genetic analysis indicates that Ecuadorian Mestizos are of predominantly Indigenous ancestry.[^263] Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendants of peoples conquered by the Incas, they are [Kichwa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kichwa "Kichwa") speakers and include the [Caranqui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca-Caranqui "Inca-Caranqui"), the [Otavalos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otavalo_people "Otavalo people"), the Cayambe, the Quitu-Caras, the [Panzaleo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzaleo "Panzaleo"), the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the [Cañari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C3%B1ari "Cañari"), and the [Saraguro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraguro_people "Saraguro people"). Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as *mitimaes*.

Coastal groups, including the [Awá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aw%C3%A1_\(kwaiker\) "Awá (kwaiker)"), [Chachi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador"), and the [Tsáchila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ts%C3%A1chila "Tsáchila"), make up 0.24% percent of the Indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the [Shuar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuar_people "Shuar people"), the [Huaorani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaorani "Huaorani"), the Siona-Secoya, the [Cofán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cof%C3%A1n_people "Cofán people"), and the [Achuar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achuar_people "Achuar people").

In 1986, Indigenous peoples formed the first "truly" national [political organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_organisation "Political organisation"). [The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONAIE "CONAIE") ([CONAIE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONAIE "CONAIE")) has been the primary political institution of Indigenous peoples since then and is now the second-largest political party in the nation. It has been influential in national politics, contributing to the ouster of presidents [Abdalá Bucaram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdal%C3%A1_Bucaram "Abdalá Bucaram") in 1997 and [Jamil Mahuad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamil_Mahuad "Jamil Mahuad") in 2000.

French Guiana is home to approximately 10,000 Indigenous peoples, such as the [Kalina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalina_people "Kalina people") and [Lokono](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokono "Lokono"). Over time, the Indigenous population has protested against various environmental issues, such as illegal gold mining, pollution, and a drastic decrease in wild game.

During the early stages of colonization, the Indigenous peoples in Guyana partook in trade relations with Dutch settlers and assisted in militia services such as hunting down escaped slaves for the British, which continued until the 19th century. Indigenous Guyanese people are responsible for the invention of the [Guyanese pepperpot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyanese_pepperpot "Guyanese pepperpot") and the foundation of the [Alleluia church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleluia_church "Alleluia church").

Guyana's Indigenous peoples have been recognized under the Constitution of 1965 and comprise 9.16% of the overall population.

The vast majority of Indigenous peoples in [Paraguay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay "Paraguay") are concentrated in the [Gran Chaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco "Gran Chaco") region in the northwest of the country, with the [Guaraní](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people "Guaraní people") making up the majority of the Indigenous population in Paraguay. The [Guaraní language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_language "Guaraní language") is recognized as an official language alongside Spanish, with approximately 90% of the population speaking Guaraní. The Indigenous population in Paraguay faces challenges such as low literacy rates and lack of safe drinking water or electricity.

According to the [2017 Census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Peruvian_census "2017 Peruvian census"), the Indigenous population in Peru makes up approximately 26%.[^5] However, this does not include [Mestizos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo "Mestizo") of mixed Indigenous and European descent, who make up the majority of the population. Genetic testing indicates that Peruvian Mestizos are of predominantly Indigenous ancestry.[^264] Indigenous traditions and customs have shaped the way Peruvians live and see themselves today. Cultural citizenship—or what Renato Rosaldo has called, "the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense" (1996:243)—is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where Indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.[^265]

According to the 2012 census, the Indigenous population of Suriname numbers around 20,000, amounting to 3.8% of the population. The most numerous Indigenous groups in Suriname primarily comprise the [Lokono](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokono "Lokono"), [Kalina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalina_people "Kalina people"), [Tiriyó](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiriy%C3%B3_people "Tiriyó people"), and [Wayana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayana "Wayana").

Approximately 6.4% of the population in Uruguay is reported to have Indigenous ancestry.[^17]

A [Warao family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warao_people "Warao people") traveling in their canoe in [Venezuela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela "Venezuela")

Most Venezuelans have some degree of Indigenous heritage even if they may not identify as such. The 2011 census estimated that around 52% of the population identified as [mestizo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo_Venezuelans "Mestizo Venezuelans"). But those who identify as Indigenous, from being raised in those cultures, make up only around 2% of the total population. The Indigenous peoples speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects. As some of the ethnic groups are very small, their native languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important Indigenous groups are the [Ye'kuana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye%27kuana "Ye'kuana"), the [Wayuu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayuu "Wayuu"), the [Kali'na](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali%27na "Kali'na"), the [Ya̧nomamö](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanomami "Yanomami"), the [Pemon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemon "Pemon"), and the [Warao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warao_people "Warao people"). The most advanced Indigenous peoples to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela are thought to have been the [Timoto-cuicas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoto-cuicas "Timoto-cuicas"), who lived in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand Indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.

The 1999 [constitution of Venezuela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Venezuela "Constitution of Venezuela") gives Indigenous peoples [special rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_rights "Special rights"), although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [primary education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education "Primary education") in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.

The Indigenous population of the Caribbean islands consisted of the [Taíno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno "Taíno") of the [Lucayan Archipelago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucayan_Archipelago "Lucayan Archipelago"), the [Greater Antilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Antilles "Greater Antilles") and the northern [Lesser Antilles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles "Lesser Antilles"), the [Kalinago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalinago "Kalinago") of the Lesser Antilles, the [Ciguayo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciguayo "Ciguayo") and [Macorix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macorix_language "Macorix language") of parts of [Hispaniola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola "Hispaniola"), and the [Guanahatabey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanahatabey "Guanahatabey") of western [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"). The overall population suffered the most adverse colonial effects out of all the Indigenous populations in the Americas, as the Kalinago have been reduced to a few islands in the Lesser Antilles such as [Dominica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica "Dominica") and the Taíno are culturally extinct, though a large proportion of populations in Greater Antillean islands such as [Puerto Rico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico") and Cuba to a lesser extent,[^266] possesses degrees of Taíno ancestry. The [Cayman Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands "Cayman Islands") were the only island group in the Caribbean to have remained unsettled by Indigenous peoples before the colonial era.[^267]

Historically, during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, the territory was ruled as a province of the Mexico-centered [Viceroyalty of New Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_New_Spain "Viceroyalty of New Spain") and thus many Mexicans including those of indgenous [Aztec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_people "Aztec people") and [Tlaxcalan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlaxcala "Tlaxcala") descent were sent as colonists there.[^268]<sup><span title="Location: Chpt. 6">: <span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180614082235/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/forced-migration-in-the-spanish-pacific-world/unruly-mexicans-in-manila/EF2599210A0715A5A91B23BB9D84B96C">Chpt. 6</a></span></span></sup> According to a genetic study by the [National Geographic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic "National Geographic"), Filipinos can trace an average of 2% of their ancestry to Native Americans.[^269] [^270]

Since the late 20th century, Indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized to achieve some sort of [self-determination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination") and preservation of their cultures. Organizations such as the [Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinator_of_Indigenous_Organizations_of_the_Amazon_River_Basin "Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin") and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunite Indigenous populations, for instance, those across the [Amazon Basin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Basin "Amazon Basin"). Similar movements for Indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [International Indian Treaty Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Indian_Treaty_Council "International Indian Treaty Council") and the accession of native Indigenous groups into the [Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrepresented_Nations_and_Peoples_Organization "Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization").

There has been a recognition of Indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") voted to adopt the [Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples "Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples"), despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.

In Colombia, various Indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [Cali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cali "Cali") in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect Indigenous lands, defend the Indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [free trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade") pact with the United States.[^271]

[Evo Morales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales "Evo Morales"), an [Aymara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_people "Aymara people") member and former [President of Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bolivia "President of Bolivia")

The first Indigenous President of the Americas was [José María Melo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Melo "José María Melo"), of [Pijao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pijao_people "Pijao people") descent, who led Colombia in 1854 starting on 17 April 1854. José was born on 9 October 1800, in [Chaparral, Tolima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral,_Tolima "Chaparral, Tolima"), and before his presidency, he fought alongside [Simon Bolivar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Bolivar "Simon Bolivar") in the [Spanish-American Wars of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_American_wars_of_independence "Spanish American wars of independence"). José María Melo led the [Republic of New Granada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_New_Granada "Republic of New Granada") during the [Colombian Civil War of 1854](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_civil_colombiana_de_1854 "es:Guerra civil colombiana de 1854") but eventually lost and was exiled on 4 December 1854.[^272]

The first Indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in the Americas was [Benito Juárez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Ju%C3%A1rez "Benito Juárez"), a [Zapotec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_peoples "Zapotec peoples") Mexican who was elected President of Mexico in 1858 and led the country until 1872 and led the country to victory during the [Second French intervention in Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_French_intervention_in_Mexico "Second French intervention in Mexico").[^273]

In 1930 [Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Miguel_S%C3%A1nchez_Cerro "Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro") became the first Peruvian President with [Indigenous Peruvian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Peruvians "Indigenous Peruvians") ancestry and the first in South America.[^274] He came to power in a military coup.

In [2005](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Bolivian_general_election "2005 Bolivian general election"), [Evo Morales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales "Evo Morales") of the [Aymara people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_people "Aymara people") was the first Indigenous candidate elected as [president of Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bolivia "President of Bolivia") and the first elected in South America.[^275]

[Genetic history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Genetic history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas") primarily focuses on [Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroups "Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups") and [Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroups "Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups"). "Y-DNA" is passed solely along the [patrilineal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineal "Patrilineal") line, from father to son, while "mtDNA" is passed down the [matrilineal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineal "Matrilineal") line, from mother to offspring of both sexes. Neither [recombines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination "Genetic recombination") and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.[^278] [Autosomal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome "Autosome") "atDNA" markers are also used but differ from mtDNA or Y-DNA in that they overlap significantly.[^279] AtDNA is generally used to measure the average continent-of-ancestry [genetic admixture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_admixture "Genetic admixture") in the entire [human genome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome "Human genome") and related [isolated populations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck "Population bottleneck").[^279]

Genetic comparisons of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome of Native Americans to that of certain [Siberian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian "Siberian") and [Central Asian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia") peoples (specifically Paleo-Siberians, Turkic, and historically the Okunev culture) have led Russian researcher I.A. Zakharov to believe that, among all the previously studied Asian peoples, it is "the peoples living between [Altai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Mountains "Altai Mountains") and [Lake Baikal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal "Lake Baikal") along the [Sayan mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayan_mountains "Sayan mountains") that are genetically closest to" Indigenous Americans.[^280]

Some scientific evidence links them to North Asian peoples, specifically the [Indigenous peoples of Siberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Siberia "Indigenous peoples of Siberia"), such as the [Ket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ket_people "Ket people"), [Selkup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selkup_people "Selkup people"), [Chukchi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukchi_people "Chukchi people"), and [Koryak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryaks "Koryaks") peoples. Indigenous peoples of the Americas have been linked to some extent to North Asian populations by the distribution of [blood types](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_types "Blood types"), and in [genetic composition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code "Genetic code") as reflected by [molecular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") data, and limited [DNA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") studies.[^281] [^282] [^283]

The common occurrence of the [Asian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people "Asian people") mtDNA haplogroups [A](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_A_\(mtDNA\) "Haplogroup A (mtDNA)"), [B](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_B_\(mtDNA\) "Haplogroup B (mtDNA)"), [C](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_C_\(mtDNA\) "Haplogroup C (mtDNA)"), and [D](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_D_\(mtDNA\) "Haplogroup D (mtDNA)") among eastern Asian and Native American populations has been noted.[^284] Some subclades of C and D that have been found in the limited populations of Native Americans who have agreed to DNA testing [^282] [^283] bear some resemblance to the C and D subclades in [Mongolian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_people "Mongolian people"), [Amur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_Oblast "Amur Oblast"), [Japanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people "Japanese people"), [Korean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_people "Korean people"), and [Ainu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people "Ainu people") populations.[^284] [^285]

Available genetic patterns lead to two main theories of genetic episodes affecting the Indigenous peoples of the Americas; first with the initial peopling of the [Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), and secondly with [European colonization of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas "European colonization of the Americas").[^286] [^287] [^288] The former is the determinant factor for the number of [gene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene") lineages, [zygosity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity "Zygosity") mutations, and founding [haplotypes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype "Haplotype") present in today's Indigenous peoples of the Americas [populations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Population history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas").[^287]

The most popular theory among anthropologists is the [Bering Strait theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Strait_theory "Bering Strait theory"), of human settlement of the [New World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World") occurring in stages from the [Bering Sea coastline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Sea "Bering Sea"), with a possible initial layover of 10,000 to 20,000 years in [Beringia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia "Beringia") for the small [founding population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect "Founder effect").[^289] [^290] [^291] The [micro-satellite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_\(genetics\) "Microsatellite (genetics)") diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicate that certain Indigenous peoples of the Americas populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.[^292] The [Na-Dené](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na-Den%C3%A9 "Na-Dené"), [Inuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit "Inuit"), and [Indigenous populations of Alaska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives "Alaska Natives") exhibit [haplogroup Q (Y-DNA)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_Q_\(Y-DNA\) "Haplogroup Q (Y-DNA)") mutations, however are distinct from other Indigenous peoples of the Americas with various mtDNA and atDNA mutations.[^293] [^294] [^295] This suggests that the earliest migrants into the northern extremes of North America and [Greenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland") derived from later migrant populations.[^296] [^297]

Multiple recent findings on autosomal DNA and full genome revealed more information about the formation, settlement, and external relationships of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas to other populations. Native Americans are very closely related to the [Paleosiberian tribes of Siberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Siberia "Indigenous peoples of Siberia"), and to the ancient samples of the [Mal'ta–Buret' culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%27ta%E2%80%93Buret%27_culture "Mal'ta–Buret' culture") ([Ancient North Eurasians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_North_Eurasians "Ancient North Eurasians")) as well as to the [Ancient Beringians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Beringians "Ancient Beringians"). Native Americans also share a relatively higher genetic affinity with [East Asian peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_peoples "East Asian peoples"). Native American genetic ancestry is occasionally dubbed as "Amerindian". This type of ancestry largely overlaps with "Paleosiberian" ancestry but is differentiated from "Neo-Siberian" ancestry which represents historical expansions from Northeast Asia and is today widespread among Siberian populations. The ancestors of Native Americans used a single migration route, most likely through Beringia, and subsequently populated all of the Americas in a time range between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago. Possible contact between Native Americans and Polynesians dates back to 1,400 years ago. Previously hypothesized "Paleo-Indian" groups turned out to be genetically identical to modern Native Americans. The controversial claim that the first peoples came from Europe via the North Atlantic, based on an ostensible similarity in stone-tool technology between the Solutrean culture of Pleistocene Europe and Clovis in North America, was undermined by the genome of the Anzick Clovis child, which sits squarely on the branch of Ancestral Native American peoples. No ancient or present-day genome (or mtDNA or Y chromosome marker) in the Americas has shown any direct affinities to Upper Palaeolithic European populations.[^298] [^299] [^300] [^301] [^302] [^303] [^304] [^305]

A qpGraph on the formation of Ancient Paleo-Siberians and Native American populations.[^306]

The date for the formation of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas gene pool ranges from 36,000 to 25,000 years ago, with their internal diverging being around 21,000 years ago, during the settlement of the Americas.[^307] Native Americans formed from the admixture of a lineage that diverged from [Ancient East Asian people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_people "East Asian people") around 36,000 years ago somewhere in [Southern China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_China "Southern China"), and subsequently migrated northwards into Siberia where they merged with a Paleolithic Siberian population known as [Ancient North Eurasians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_North_Eurasians "Ancient North Eurasians") (ANE), deeply related to European hunter-gatherers, giving rise to both [Indigenous peoples of Siberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Siberia "Indigenous peoples of Siberia") and Ancestral Native Americans. Both Paleo-Siberians and Ancestral Native Americans derive between 32 and 44% of their ancestry from Ancient North Eurasians (ANE), and 56–68% ancestry from Ancient East Asians.[^308] [^309] [^310] [^311] Based on a 2023 mitochondrial DNA study, a subsequent wave of migration from [Northern China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China "North China"), originating near the present-day cities of Beijing and Tianjin, occurred as recently as 9000 BCE, following a previously unknown coastal route from Asia to America.[^312]

The following table provides estimates for each country or territory in the Americas of the populations of Indigenous people and those with partial Indigenous ancestry, each expressed as a percentage of the overall population. The total percentage obtained by adding both of these categories is also given.

*Note:* these categories are inconsistently defined and measured differently from country to country. Some figures are based on the results of population-wide genetic surveys while others are based on self-identification or observational estimation.

Retrieved 13 September 2020. \[Page 1\] ABSTRACT: Filipinos represent a significant contemporary demographic group globally, yet they are underrepresented in the forensic anthropological literature. Given the complex population history of the Philippines, it is important to ensure that traditional methods for assessing the biological profile are appropriate when applied to these peoples. Here we analyze the classification trends of a modern Filipino sample (n = 110) when using the Fordisc 3.1 (FD3) software. We hypothesize that Filipinos represent an admixed population drawn largely from Asian and marginally from European parental gene pools, such that FD3 will classify these individuals morphometrically into reference samples that reflect a range of European admixture, in quantities from small to large. Our results show the greatest classification into Asian reference groups (72.7%), followed by Hispanic (12.7%), Indigenous American (7.3%), African (4.5%), and European (2.7%) groups included in FD3. This general pattern did not change between males and females. Moreover, replacing the raw craniometric values with their shape variables did not significantly alter the trends already observed. These classification trends for Filipino crania provide useful information for casework interpretation in forensic laboratory practice. Our findings can help biological anthropologists to better understand the evolutionary, population historical, and statistical reasons for FD3-generated classifications. The results of our study indicate that ancestry estimation in forensic anthropology would benefit from population-focused research that gives consideration to histories of colonialism and periods of admixture.

Our finding of no excess allele sharing with non-Native American populations in the ancient samples is also striking as many of these individuals—including those at Lapa do Santo—have a "Paleoamerican" cranial morphology that has been suggested to be evidence of the spread of a substructured population of at least two different Native American source populations from Asia to the Americas (von Cramon-Taubadel et al., 2017). Our finding that early Holocene individuals with such a morphology are consistent with deriving all their ancestry from the same homogeneous ancestral population as other Native Americans extends the finding of Raghavan et al., 2015 who came to a similar conclusion after analyzing Native Americans inferred to have Paleoamerican morphology who lived within the last millennium.

It is now evident that the initial dispersal involved the movement from northeast Asia. The first peoples, once south of the continental ice sheets, spread widely, expanded rapidly and branched into multiple populations. Their descendants—over the next fifteen millennia—experienced varying degrees of isolation, admixture, continuity and replacement, and their genomes help to illuminate the relationships among major subgroups of Native American populations. Notably, all ancient individuals in the Americas, save for later-arriving Arctic peoples, are more closely related to contemporary Indigenous American individuals than to any other population elsewhere, which challenges the claim—which is based on anatomical evidence—that there was an early, non-Native American population in the Americas.
