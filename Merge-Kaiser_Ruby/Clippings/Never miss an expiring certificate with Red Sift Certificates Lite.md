## FAQs

What are the risks associated with expired certificates?

When certificates expire, they lose their ability to securely encrypt data during online transactions. This opens the door for hackers to potentially eavesdrop on sensitive information or tamper with data. They can also lead to website downtime which can cause huge financial losses. [Read our blog](https://blog.redsift.com/certificates/a-real-world-view-how-expired-certificates-can-cause-service-downtime-and-financial-losses/) that gives real-world examples of the losses big name brands have experienced due to expired certificates.

Isn't automation enough to make certificate expiration monitoring obsolete?

Automation isn’t unbreakable. Red Sift Certificates Lite steps in as a critical safety net, offering visibility and alerts for gaps automation can’t cover—like missed renewals, misconfigurations, or unmanaged certificates. With 7-day alerts, we catch potential issues early, preventing downtime and keeping your systems protected.

What is the difference between Certificates Lite and the enterprise Red Sift Certificates application?

While Certificates Lite provides basic expiration monitoring, the enterprise-level

[Red Sift Certificates application](https://redsift.com/pulse-platform/certificates)

offers advanced discovery and monitoring across all your certificates, identifying expired, misused, or misconfigured certificates to prevent downtime, reputational risks, and compliance issues.

With just a single domain name, Certificates Enterprise scans your entire digital infrastructure—covering network assets, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), certificate authorities, DNS providers, and registrars. It continuously tracks certificate deployment and configuration, while also analyzing certificate transparency logs to detect any unauthorized or unexpected certificates.

A unified dashboard offers complete visibility over all active certificates, with customizable expiration alerts and daily assessments to keep you ahead of renewals, prevent PKI-related downtime, and strengthen network security.
