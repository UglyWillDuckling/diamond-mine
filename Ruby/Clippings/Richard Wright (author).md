**Richard Nathaniel Wright** (September 4, 1908 – November 28, 1960) was an American author of novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction. Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of [African Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans "African Americans") during the late 19th to mid 20th centuries suffering discrimination and violence. His best known works include the novella collection *[Uncle Tom's Children](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Children "Uncle Tom's Children")* (1938), the novel *[Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Son "Native Son")* (1940), and the memoir *[Black Boy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Boy "Black Boy")* (1945). Literary critics believe his work helped change [race relations in the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States "Racism in the United States") in the mid-20th century.

## Early life and education

In Chicago in 1932, Wright began writing with the [Federal Writer's Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Writers%27_Project "Federal Writers' Project") and became a member of the [American Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA"). In 1937, he relocated to New York and became the Bureau Chief of the communist publication, the *[Daily Worker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Worker "Daily Worker")*.[^31] He would write over 200 articles for the publication from 1937 to 1938. This allowed him to cover stories and issues that interested him, revealing depression-era America into light with well-written prose.[^32]

He worked on the Federal Writers' Project guidebook to the city, *New York Panorama* (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [Harlem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem "Harlem"). Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the *Daily Worker* and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine, *New Challenge.* The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [Ralph Ellison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Ellison "Ralph Ellison") that would last for years. He was awarded the *[Story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_\(magazine\) "Story (magazine)")* magazine first prize of $500 for his short story "Fire and Cloud".[^story-33]

After receiving the *Story* prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of *Lawd Today* and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [Paul Laurence Dunbar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laurence_Dunbar "Paul Laurence Dunbar"), to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [Harper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row "Harper & Row") all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.

Wright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled *[Uncle Tom's Children](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Children "Uncle Tom's Children")* (1938). He based some stories on [lynching](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States "Lynching in the United States") in the [Deep South](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South "Deep South"). The publication and favorable reception of *Uncle Tom's Children* improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of *New Masses.* [Granville Hicks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granville_Hicks "Granville Hicks"), a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel *[Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Son "Native Son")*, which was published in 1940.

Based on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [Guggenheim Fellowship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Fellowship "Guggenheim Fellowship"), which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete *Native Son.* During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [Communists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communists "Communists") whom Wright had known in Chicago.[^34] They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [Brooklyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn") in the [Fort Greene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Greene_Historic_District "Fort Greene Historic District") neighborhood.[^35]

After publication, *Native Son* was selected by the [Book of the Month Club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Month_Club "Book of the Month Club") as its first book by an African-American author. It was a daring choice. The lead character, [Bigger Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Thomas "Bigger Thomas"), is bound by the limitations that society places on African Americans. Unlike most in this situation, he gains his own [agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_\(philosophy\) "Agency (philosophy)") and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts. Wright's characterization of Bigger led to him being criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of *Native Son*, people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of *Native Son* was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [Edwin Rosskam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Rosskam "Edwin Rosskam"). While in Chicago he visited the *[American Negro Exposition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Negro_Exposition "American Negro Exposition")* with [Langston Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes "Langston Hughes"), [Arna Bontemps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arna_Bontemps "Arna Bontemps") and [Claude McKay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_McKay "Claude McKay").

 [Canada Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Lee "Canada Lee") as [Bigger Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Thomas "Bigger Thomas") in the [Orson Welles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles "Orson Welles") production of *[Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Son_\(play\) "Native Son (play)")* (1941)

Wright traveled to [Chapel Hill, North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"), to collaborate with playwright [Paul Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_\(playwright\) "Paul Green (playwright)") on a dramatic adaptation of *Native Son.* In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [Spingarn Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spingarn_Medal "Spingarn Medal") of the [NAACP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP "NAACP") for noteworthy achievement. His play *[Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Son_\(play\) "Native Son (play)")* opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [Orson Welles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles "Orson Welles") as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [Farm Security Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration "Farm Security Administration"). The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, *[12 Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Million_Black_Voices "12 Million Black Voices")*, was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.

Wright's memoir *[Black Boy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Boy "Black Boy")* (1945) describes his early life from [Roxie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxie,_Mississippi "Roxie, Mississippi") up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It includes his clashes with his [Seventh-day Adventist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church "Seventh-day Adventist Church") family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. *American Hunger*, which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of *Black Boy.* The [Library of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_America "Library of America") edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.[^36]

*American Hunger* details Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implies he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.[^37] In the book's restored form, Wright used the [diptych](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diptych "Diptych") structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned "bourgeois" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")'s [Great Purge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") in the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union").

 Plaque commemorating Wright's residence in Paris, at 14, [rue Monsieur le Prince](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_Monsieur-le-Prince "Rue Monsieur-le-Prince").

Following a stay of a few months in [Québec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9bec "Québec"), Canada, including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-Pétronille on the [Île d'Orléans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans "Île d'Orléans"),[^38] Wright moved to Paris in 1946. He became a permanent American [expatriate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate "Expatriate").[^39]

In Paris, Wright became friends with French writers [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre "Jean-Paul Sartre") and [Albert Camus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus "Albert Camus"), whom he had met while still in New York, and he and his wife became particularly good friends with [Simone de Beauvoir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir "Simone de Beauvoir"), who stayed with them in 1947.[^40] However, as Michel Fabre argues, Wright's existentialist leanings were more influenced by [Soren Kierkegaard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soren_Kierkegaard "Soren Kierkegaard"), [Edmund Husserl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl"), and especially [Martin Heidegger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger").[^41] In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger "directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of [existentialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism") and [Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") for Wright".[^42] His [Existentialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialist "Existentialist") phase was expressed in his second novel, *[The Outsider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_\(Richard_Wright\) "The Outsider (Richard Wright)")* (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [Chester Himes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Himes "Chester Himes") and [James Baldwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin "James Baldwin"). His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay "Everybody's Protest Novel"[^jbhe-22] (collected in *[Notes of a Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_of_a_Native_Son "Notes of a Native Son")*), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published *Savage Holiday*.

After becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology *[The God That Failed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_That_Failed "The God That Failed");* his essay had been published in the *[Atlantic Monthly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Monthly "Atlantic Monthly")* three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of *Black Boy.* He was invited to join the [Congress for Cultural Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_for_Cultural_Freedom "Congress for Cultural Freedom"), which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA"). Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [FBI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI") had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [blacklisted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist "Hollywood blacklist") by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [Argentinian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina") film version of *[Native Son](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Son_\(1951_film\) "Native Son (1951 film)").*

In mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [Gold Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_\(region\) "Gold Coast (region)"), where [Kwame Nkrumah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah "Kwame Nkrumah") was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [Ghana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana "Ghana"). Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [Accra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra "Accra") on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [U.S. State Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State"). The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah's adviser [George Padmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Padmore "George Padmore") about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [Trinidadian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad "Trinidad") living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, *[Black Power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Power_\(Richard_Wright_book\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Black Power (Richard Wright book) (page does not exist)")*, was published in 1954; its London publisher was [Dennis Dobson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Dobson "Dennis Dobson"), who also published Padmore's work.[^43]

Whatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [Addison Gayle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Gayle "Addison Gayle"), a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [Smith Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Act "Smith Act").[^44]

Historian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") during the 1950s in the United States. She found that he was under what his friend Chester Himes called "extraordinary pressure" to avoid writing about the US.[^polsgrove80-81-45] As *[Ebony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony_\(magazine\) "Ebony (magazine)")* magazine delayed publishing his essay "I Choose Exile", Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that "a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty".[^polsgrove80-81-45] He thought the *[Atlantic Monthly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Monthly "Atlantic Monthly")* was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.[^polsgrove80-81-45][^46]

In 1955, Wright visited [Indonesia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") for the [Bandung Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Conference "Bandung Conference").[^:gao-47] He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in *[The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_Curtain "The Color Curtain")*. Wright praised the conference extensively.[^:gao-47] He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [PEN Club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEN_Club "PEN Club") Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write *The Color Curtain*.[^48] Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [travel writing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_writing "Travel writing").[^49]

Other works by Wright included *White Man, Listen!* (1957) and a novel *The Long Dream* (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [Ketti Frings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketti_Frings "Ketti Frings"). It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.[^50] A collection of [short stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story "Short story"), *Eight Men*, was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.

His agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page *Island of Hallucinations* manuscript in February 1959.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.

On June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of *White Man, Listen!*, Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [amoebic dysentery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_dysentery "Amoebic dysentery"), probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959, his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and "four hassles in twelve days" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

On February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of *The Long Dream* had received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get *The Long Dream* published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of *Island of Hallucinations*, for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [Doubleday and Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleday_\(publisher\) "Doubleday (publisher)").

In June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [Sorbonne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris "University of Paris"), Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.

In spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy"). Still interested in literature, Wright helped [Kyle Onstott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Onstott "Kyle Onstott") get his novel *[Mandingo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandingo_\(novel\) "Mandingo (novel)")* (1957) published in France.

Wright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture "The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States", delivered to students and members of the [American Church in Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Church_in_Paris "American Church in Paris"). He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against *Native Son* and the quarrels that [James Baldwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin_\(writer\) "James Baldwin (writer)") and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work *Daddy Goodness* and gave him the manuscript.

 Wright's grave

Wright died of a heart attack in Paris on November 28, 1960, at the age of 52. He was interred in [Père Lachaise Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery "Père Lachaise Cemetery").[^51][^52] Wright's daughter Julia has claimed that her father was murdered.[^53]

A number of Wright's works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of *Native Son*, *Black Boy*, and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella *Rite of Passage* was published for the first time.[^54]

In the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [haiku](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English "Haiku in English") and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (*Haiku: This Other World*) with 817 of his own favorite haiku. Many of these haiku have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.

A collection of Wright's travel writings was published by the [University Press of Mississippi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Press_of_Mississippi "University Press of Mississippi") in 2001. At his death, Wright left an unfinished book, *A Father's Law*,[^55] dealing with a black policeman and the son he suspects of murder. His daughter Julia Wright published *A Father's Law* in January 2008. An omnibus edition containing Wright's political works was published under the title *Three Books from Exile: Black Power; The Color Curtain*; and *White Man, Listen!*

In August 1939, with [Ralph Ellison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Ellison "Ralph Ellison") as best man,[^56] Wright married Dhimah Rose Meidman,[^57] a modern dance teacher of Russian Jewish ancestry. The marriage ended a year later.

On March 12, 1941, he married Ellen Poplar (née Poplowitz),[^58][^family-59] a Communist organizer from Brooklyn.[^60] They had two daughters: Julia, born in 1942, and Rachel, born in 1949.[^family-59]

Ellen Wright, who died on April 6, 2004, aged 92, was the executor of Wright's estate. In this capacity, she unsuccessfully sued a biographer, the poet and writer [Margaret Walker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Walker "Margaret Walker"), in *[Wright v. Warner Books, Inc.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_v._Warner_Books,_Inc. "Wright v. Warner Books, Inc.")* She was a literary agent, and her clients included [Simone de Beauvoir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir "Simone de Beauvoir"), [Eldridge Cleaver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver "Eldridge Cleaver"), and [Violette Leduc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Leduc "Violette Leduc").[^61][^62]

[Banned Books Week](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_Books_Week "Banned Books Week") reading of *Black Boy* at [Shimer College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimer_College "Shimer College") in 2013

*Black Boy* became an instant best-seller upon its publication in 1945.[^67] Wright's stories published during the 1950s disappointed some critics who said that his move to Europe had alienated him from African Americans and separated him from his emotional and psychological roots.[^68] Many of Wright's works failed to satisfy the rigid standards of [New Criticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Criticism "New Criticism") during a period when the works of younger black writers gained in popularity.[^69]

During the 1950s Wright grew more internationalist in outlook. While he accomplished much as an important public literary and political figure with a worldwide reputation, his creative work did decline.[^70]

While interest in *Black Boy* ebbed during the 1950s, this has remained one of his best selling books. Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. *Black Boy* remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man's search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as [James Baldwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin "James Baldwin") and [Ralph Ellison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Ellison "Ralph Ellison"). [John A. Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Williams "John A. Williams") included a fictionalized version of Wright's life and death in his 1967 novel *[The Man Who Cried I Am](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Cried_I_Am "The Man Who Cried I Am")*.

It is generally agreed that the influence of Wright's *Native Son* is not a matter of literary style or technique.[^footnotecorkery200717%e2%80%9328-71] Rather, this book affected ideas and attitudes, and *Native Son* has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. "Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle," said writer [Amiri Baraka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiri_Baraka "Amiri Baraka").[^72]

During the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals. Richard Wright conferences were held on university campuses from Mississippi to New Jersey. A new film version of *Native Son*, with a screenplay by [Richard Wesley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wesley "Richard Wesley"), was released in December 1986. Certain Wright novels became required reading in a number of American high schools, universities and colleges.[^73]

Recent critics have called for a reassessment of Wright's later work in view of his philosophical project. Notably, [Paul Gilroy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gilroy "Paul Gilroy") has argued that "the depth of his philosophical interests has been either overlooked or misconceived by the almost exclusively literary inquiries that have dominated analysis of his writing".[^74][^75]

Wright was featured in a 90-minute documentary about the WPA Writers' Project entitled *Soul of a People: Writing America's Story* (2009).[^76] His life and work during the 1930s is highlighted in the companion book, *Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America*.[^77]
