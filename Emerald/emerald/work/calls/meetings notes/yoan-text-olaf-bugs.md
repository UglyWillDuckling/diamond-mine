## Yoans response to Olaf based on the All-hands meet from [[2025-06-02-Mon]] 

Hello Olaf, just to discuss about my question "What is the strategy about solving bugs"
This is obvious that teams have to reduce bugs we have in production right now and reduce the delay before solving them
But you may be missing an important piece of the current puzzle. When the team is working on the same product on which a bug has been
discovered. it's obvious that as you said. it's only priority matter to solve if ASAP
But when teams are working on White Label applications whereas the most bugs and issues we're facing today are on the legacy application
on which no one is able to work on for a lot of reasons

* Different programming language
* No knowledge at all how o launch the app
* No knowledge about how to deploy the app

So what you're saying about the prioritization is not working for some cases because o a Lack of resources and priorities that are changing
all the time by the business;

The PM and teams are split into multiple topics that are critical.
A concrete example about that is how to maintain the French CRM (named Backyard): The app is super legacy (about 15yo) implemented in
PHP etc... We lost the whole knowledge since a while and the maintenance of this app is on my team's shoulders.

We're spending a lot of time to investigate, document etc... but in a meanwhile. Solving a bug takes weeks just because we're trying to
understand how it works, and how to solve it.

**Today, only 1 person is able to code in** **PHP**, meaning that even if they're able to work on the codebase. they can't solve multiple bugs at the
same time as building a fresh new features to help the business.

Which is why I'm asking concrete solutions. It's probably not on your hands to bring me answers but if we want to reduce bugs and solve
issues. We will have to re-invest on legacy apps and allocate people on them.
Instead of just expecting that 25% of the Run is enough to handle everything, which is not the always the case.

If you need more detail. I'm available to discuss about it with you
