A playthrough of Asmik's 1990 NES game, Conquest of the Crystal Palace.  
  
Here's an absolute gem of a platformer from the 8-bit era, developed by not-yet-then-famous Quest, developer of the SRPG Ogre Battle series of games, as well as the tragically underrated (and now ludicrously overpriced - as in a compete copy goes for well over a grand) shooter, Magical Chase, for the TG16.  
  
Conquest is a really personable fantasy platformer dressed up in a fairly novel take on the whole ancient China motif, and lets you control a super cute, hyper violent, Ã¼ber-mystical attack-dog sidekick, as well as watch faux-Chun Li deliver exposition via news broadcasts at the store that appears in each stage. It looks great, the music is fantastic (like it is in nearly all of Quest's games), and it's challenging without feeling unfair. It's certainly an obscure title, but it's one that's well worth playing.
