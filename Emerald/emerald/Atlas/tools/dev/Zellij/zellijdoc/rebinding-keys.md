Zellij places great emphasis on being a keyboard-first application. As such, Zellij uses many different shortcuts in order to give users the power to control the application and do so in a way that would make sense to them - not forcing them to learn many obtuse keyboard shortcuts that make little sense and are difficult to remember.

For some users, these shortcuts may "collide" with other shortcuts they use in the terminal in other programs. For these users, Zellij offers several solutions.

1. Using a "non-colliding" [keybinding preset](keybinding-presets.html)
2. Changing the [modifier keys](changing-modifiers.html) Zellij uses for keybindings to ones that do not collide
3. Reconfiguring keybindings entirely as part of the [configuration file](keybindings.html)
