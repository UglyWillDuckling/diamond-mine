## Yesterday
> was the time of our lives

Worked again on the [[Use lead for project creation]].
Started writing tests for this and made an almost complete refactor of the
`estima_processing` action by creating a new class for it.

We also hads useful calls, Sprint planning and Sprint Review.

## today üóì

Continue working on [[Use lead for project creation]]. The plan for today is to wrap up the first set of changes and crate a PR for them. At the same time almost we will be planning on how to deploy and test [[Paulo]]'s hotfix on production.
We will need to seperate the work(changes) into two sets(branches), one for the short term test and the other for the long-term solution with refactoring and testing implemented.

### goals üè¥
- complete the [[canary test release]] and communicate to get a clear of picture
- make progress on the test front - have some tests that at least partially be trusted

### todo's ‚úî
- [ ] make the plan for the [[canary test release]] of [[Use lead for project creation]]
- [ ] make a PR for the work-in-progress for the long-term solution
- [ ] continue work on writing tests for [[Use lead for project creation]]

### notes üóí
- It is very effective to delegate work to other people
	- likewise, it is extremely useful to first do the work that will make it possible for others to do their work first
	- this also means communicating - if you can communicate clearly the situation and the solutions other people can be effective and ==help you out== too
