## explain
  Imagine you have a toy robot that you can control with a remote control. The
  robot can do different tasks, like moving around, picking up toys, or even
  dancing. Now, let's say you want to let your friend control the robot too,
  but they have a different remote control.

  To make this work, you need a way to let your friend's remote control
  communicate with your robot. This is similar to what workload identity
  federation does in the world of computers.

  Workload identity federation is a way for two different computer systems to
  trust each other and allow one system to use the other system's resources.
  This is done by creating a "federation" between the two systems, which is a
  fancy word for a agreement that lets them work together.

  In this way, a workload (which could be a piece of software or a service) on
  one system can identity itself to another system using a special identity
  token. This token is like a pass that lets the workload access resources on
  the other system.

  So, just like how your robot can do tasks for your friend because their
  remote control can communicate with your robot, workload identity federation
  lets different computer systems work together and share resources.
