Love this monitor for programming. I can say for coding it is great. It really brings out the Dark Themes in my IDE and i can tell a difference.

Finally, a hi-dpi 16:10 monitor! Crisp text, good brightness, and good reflection handling.

I've never seen a monitor soak up reflections like this one. This has massively improved eyestrain for me, allowing lower brightness and still have better clarity.

Text clarity is good and color is above average. The “coding” hotkeys seemed a bit gimmicky at first, but now I find them very handy to quickly toggle between color/sharpness/blue-filter options.

## Got Questions ?

### Why do I need a BenQ Programming Monitor?

We understand your aspiration to become a passionate programmer, constantly improving and tackling more challenging problems. To achieve this goal, you need to maintain long-term focus and immerse yourself in a state of logical thinking. With BenQ Programming Monitors, say goodbye to the frustration of losing focus due to unclear code display.

### Clarity in coding is very important. Does a matte panel affect clarity?

With BenQ's exclusive contrast optimization, the Nano Matte Panel not only offers excellent anti-glare performance but also enhances code clarity.

### What is screen glare? What damage can it cause to your eyes?

Screen glare refers to visual discomfort or reduced visibility that occurs when there is a significant difference in brightness between an object and its background. This often happens in situations where bright light sources are present near darker areas, making it difficult for the eyes to adjust. It can lead to several issues including visual fatigue, blurred vision, headaches, eye discomfort, decreased color perception, and impaired depth perception. For night hours and dark room users, we provide Night Hours Protection. Its intelligent ambient light detection and auto-switch capabilities ensure effortless and consistent eye comfort. The MoonHalo bias backlighting eliminates the contrast between the monitor and its surroundings, ensuring optimal eye protection and focus anytime, whether you're working at home or in the office.
