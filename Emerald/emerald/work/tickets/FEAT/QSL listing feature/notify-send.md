SYNOPSIS

       notify-send [OPTIONS] {summary} [body]

DESCRIPTION
       With notify-send you can send desktop notifications to the user via a notification daemon from the command line. These notifications can
       be used to inform the user about an event or display some form of information without getting in the userâ€™s way.

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
           Show help and exit.

       -a, --app-name=APP_NAME
           Specifies the app name for the notification.

       -A, --action=[NAME=]Text...
           Specifies the actions to display to the user. Implies --wait to wait for user input. May be set multiple times. The NAME of the action
           is output to stdout. If NAME is not specified, the numerical index of the option is used (starting with 1).

       -u, --urgency=LEVEL
           Specifies the urgency level (low, normal, critical).

       -t, --expire-time=TIME
           The duration, in milliseconds, for the notification to appear on screen.

           Not all implementations use this parameter. GNOME Shell and Notify OSD always ignore it, while Plasma ignores it for notifications
           with the critical urgency level.

       -i, --icon=ICON
           Specifies an icon filename or stock icon to display.

       -c, --category=TYPE[,TYPE...]
           Specifies the notification category.

       -h, --hint=TYPE:NAME:VALUE
           Specifies basic extra data to pass. Valid types are BOOLEAN, INT, DOUBLE, STRING, BYTE and VARIANT.

       -p, --print-id
           Print the notification ID.

       -r, --replace-id=REPLACE_ID
           The ID of the notification to replace.

       -w, --wait
           Wait for the notification to be closed before exiting. If the expire-time is set, it will be used as the maximum waiting time.

       -e, --transient
           Show a transient notification. Transient notifications by-pass the server's persistence capability, if any. And so it won't be
           preserved until the user acknowledges it.
