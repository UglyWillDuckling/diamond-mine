## lyrics
They came like beasts who'd tasted blood
First a few and then the flood
Coursing over hill and dale
Wet paw prints on their bloody trail
Return the peace you took from me
Give me back my community
Show us the goodwill you were shown
But leave us alone

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Yeah, restore the temple of Isis at Memphis

Their hunger like a worm inside them
No sacred place could be denied them
They who talk all day of beauty
Call all the plain things dirty
Melted holes in celluloid
Give me back what you've destroyed
You who come demanding proof
Let your God rebuild this roof

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Yeah, restore the temple of Isis at Memphis

Make it whole again if you can
Stand in the smoke and say some prayers
Wave your hand

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Restore the temple of Isis at Memphis

"Monks and zealous laymen (*philoponoi*) returned to [[Alexandria]] with the pagan priest from [[Menouthis]], whom they had arrested, along with twenty camels laden with idols.
In the capital the mob brought together quantities of statues found in the baths and in private homes -- not all of them cult idols, to be sure. 
They broke the legs and the arms of the statues, shouting, 'their gods do not have surgeons!" -- Pierre Chuvin, *A Chronicle of the Last Pagans* (p. 109).
