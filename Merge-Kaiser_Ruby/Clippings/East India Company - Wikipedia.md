The **East India Company** (**EIC**) <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> was an English, and later British, [joint-stock company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company "Joint-stock company") that was founded in 1600 and dissolved in 1874.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Times-5"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It was formed to [trade in the Indian Ocean region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_trade "Indian Ocean trade"), initially with the [East Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies "East Indies") (South Asia and Southeast Asia), and later with East Asia. The company gained [control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_India "Company rule in India") and [Hong Kong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong "British Hong Kong"). At its peak, the company was the largest corporation in the world by various measures and had its own armed forces in the form of the company's three [presidency armies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_armies "Presidency armies"), totalling about 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of the [British Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army "British Army") at certain times.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

Originally [chartered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_company "Chartered company") as the "Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies," <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-jiscuk-7"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> the company rose to account for half of the world's trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-onlinegallery-9"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> particularly in basic commodities including [cotton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton "Cotton"), [silk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk "Silk"), [indigo dye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_dye "Indigo dye"), [sugar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar "Sugar"), [salt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt "Salt"), [spices](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice "Spice"), [saltpetre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate "Potassium nitrate"), [tea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea "Tea"), and later, [opium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium "Opium"). The company also initiated the beginnings of the [British Raj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj") in the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-onlinegallery-9"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company eventually came to rule large areas of the Indian subcontinent, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company-ruled areas in the region gradually expanded after the [Battle of Plassey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey "Battle of Plassey") in 1757 and by 1858 most of modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was either ruled by the company or [princely states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state "Princely state") closely tied to it by treaty. Following the [Sepoy Rebellion of 1857](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy_Rebellion_of_1857 "Sepoy Rebellion of 1857"), the [Government of India Act 1858](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1858 "Government of India Act 1858") led to the [British Crown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown "The Crown") assuming direct control of present-day Bangladesh, Pakistan and India in the form of the new [British Indian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Empire "British Indian Empire").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Conquests-11"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company subsequently experienced recurring problems with its finances, despite frequent government intervention. The company was dissolved in 1874 under the terms of the [East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Stock_Dividend_Redemption_Act_1873 "East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873") enacted one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of the British Empire had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.

James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601

In 1577, [Francis Drake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake "Francis Drake") set out on [an expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake%27s_circumnavigation "Francis Drake's circumnavigation") from England to plunder Spanish settlements in South America in search of gold and silver. Sailing in the *[Golden Hind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Hind "Golden Hind")* he achieved this, and then sailed across the Pacific Ocean in 1579, known then only to the Spanish and Portuguese. Drake eventually sailed into the [East Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies "East Indies") and came across the [Moluccas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluku_Islands "Maluku Islands"), also known as the Spice Islands, and met [Sultan Babullah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babullah_of_Ternate "Babullah of Ternate"). In exchange for linen, gold, and silver, the English obtained a large haul of exotic spices, including cloves and nutmeg. Drake returned to England in 1580 and became a hero; his circumnavigation raised an enormous amount of money for England's coffers, and investors received a return of some 5,000 percent. Thus started an important element in the eastern design during the late sixteenth century.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Lawson2-12"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

Soon after the [Spanish Armada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Armada "Spanish Armada") 's defeat in 1588, the captured [Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") and Portuguese ships and cargoes enabled English voyagers to travel the globe in search of riches.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> London merchants presented a petition to [Elizabeth I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I "Elizabeth I") for permission to sail to the Indian Ocean.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-igi-ii-p454-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The aim was to deliver a decisive blow to the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of far-eastern trade.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Wernham-15"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Elizabeth granted her permission and in 1591, [James Lancaster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lancaster "James Lancaster") in the [*Bonaventure*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_ship_Bonaventure_\(1567\) "English ship Bonaventure (1567)") with two other ships,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Holmes-16"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> financed by the [Levant Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant_Company "Levant Company"), sailed from England around the [Cape of Good Hope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope "Cape of Good Hope") to the [Arabian Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea "Arabian Sea"), becoming the first English expedition to reach India that way.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Holmes-16"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Anarchy-17"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 5">: 5 </span></sup>  Having sailed around [Cape Comorin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Comorin "Cape Comorin") to the [Malay Peninsula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Peninsula "Malay Peninsula"), they preyed on Spanish and Portuguese ships there before returning to England in 1594.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-igi-ii-p454-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>

The biggest prize that galvanised English trade was the seizure of a large Portuguese [carrack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrack "Carrack"), the *[Madre de Deus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madre_de_Deus "Madre de Deus")*, by [Walter Raleigh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Raleigh "Walter Raleigh") and the [Earl of Cumberland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clifford,_3rd_Earl_of_Cumberland "George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland") at the [Battle of Flores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Flores_\(1592\) "Battle of Flores (1592)") on 13 August 1592.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-McCulloch-18"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> When she was brought in to [Dartmouth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth,_Devon "Dartmouth, Devon") she was the largest vessel ever seen in England and she carried chests of jewels, pearls, gold, silver coins, [ambergris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambergris "Ambergris"), cloth, tapestries, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, [benjamin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoin_\(resin\) "Benzoin (resin)") (a highly aromatic balsamic resin used for perfumes and medicines), red dye, [cochineal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal "Cochineal") and ebony.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Equally valuable was the ship's [rutter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutter_\(nautical\) "Rutter (nautical)") (mariner's handbook) containing vital information on the [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_China_Trade "Old China Trade"), India, and Japan trade routes.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-McCulloch-18"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1596, three more English ships sailed east but all were lost at sea.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-igi-ii-p454-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> A year later however saw the arrival of [Ralph Fitch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fitch "Ralph Fitch"), an adventurer merchant who, with his companions, had made a remarkable nine year overland journey to [Mesopotamia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), the [Persian Gulf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf"), the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Fitch was consulted on Indian affairs and gave even more valuable information to Lancaster.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1599, a group of prominent merchants and explorers met to discuss a potential East Indies venture under a [royal charter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter "Royal charter").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Anarchy-17"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 1–2">: 1–2 </span></sup>  Besides Fitch and Lancaster,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Anarchy-17"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 5">: 5 </span></sup>  the group included [Stephen Soame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Soame "Stephen Soame"), then [Lord Mayor of London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_London "Lord Mayor of London"); [Thomas Smythe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Smythe "Thomas Smythe"), a powerful London politician and administrator who had established the [Levant Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant_Company "Levant Company"); [Richard Hakluyt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hakluyt "Richard Hakluyt"), writer and proponent of [English colonisation of the Americas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_colonization_of_the_Americas "British colonization of the Americas"); and several other sea-farers who had served with Drake and Raleigh.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Anarchy-17"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 1–2">: 1–2 </span></sup> 

On 22 September, the group stated their intention "to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the which it may please the Lord to prosper)" and to themselves invest £30,133 (over £4,000,000 in today's money).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-british-history.ac.uk-23"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Two days later, the "Adventurers" reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the project.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-british-history.ac.uk-23"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Although their first attempt had not been completely successful, they sought the Queen's unofficial approval to continue. They bought ships for the venture and increased their investment to £68,373.

They convened again a year later, on 31 December 1600, and this time they succeeded; the Queen responded favourably to a petition by [George, Earl of Cumberland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clifford,_3rd_Earl_of_Cumberland "George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland") and 218 others,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> including James Lancaster, [Sir John Harte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harte_\(mayor\) "John Harte (mayor)"), [Sir John Spencer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Spencer_\(Lord_Mayor_of_London\) "John Spencer (Lord Mayor of London)") (both of whom had been [Lord Mayor of London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_London "Lord Mayor of London")), the adventurer [Edward Michelborne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Michelborne "Edward Michelborne"), the nobleman [William Cavendish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cavendish,_1st_Earl_of_Devonshire "William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire") and other [aldermen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldermen "Aldermen") and citizens.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-EIC-Charters-25"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> She granted her charter to their corporation named **Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies**.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-igi-ii-p454-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> For a period of fifteen years, the charter awarded the company a monopoly <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the [Straits of Magellan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straits_of_Magellan "Straits of Magellan").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> Any traders there without a licence from the company were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo (half of which would go to the Crown and half to the company), as well as imprisonment at the "royal pleasure".<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup>

In March 1604, Sir [Henry Middleton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Middleton_\(captain\) "Henry Middleton (captain)") commanded the company's [second voyage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_voyage_to_Asia "Second voyage to Asia").

Initially, the company struggled in the [spice trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_trade "Spice trade") because of competition from the [Dutch East India Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company "Dutch East India Company"). This rivalry led to military skirmishes, with each company establishing fortified trading posts, fleets, and alliances with local rulers. The Dutch, better financed and supported by their government, gained the upper hand by establishing a stronghold in the spice islands (now Indonesia), enforcing a near-monopoly through aggressive policies that eventually drove the EIC to seek trade opportunities in India instead. The English company opened a [factory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_\(trading_post\) "Factory (trading post)") (trading post) in [Bantam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banten_\(town\) "Banten (town)") on Java on its first voyage, and imports of [pepper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pepper "Black pepper") from Java remained an important part of the company's trade for twenty years.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company decided to explore the feasibility of a foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [Mughal Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire "Mughal Empire"), and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-fordham1-36"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>

However, in 1609, he renewed the East India Company's charter for an indefinite period, with the proviso that its privileges would be annulled if trade was unprofitable for three consecutive years.

In 1615, James I instructed Sir [Thomas Roe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Roe "Thomas Roe") to visit the Mughal Emperor Nur-ud-din Salim [Jahangir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir "Jahangir") (r. 1605–1627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company exclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas. In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-fordham1-36"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>

> Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure. For confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.
> 
> —  Nuruddin Salim Jahangir, Letter to James I.

The company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [Estado da Índia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_da_%C3%8Dndia "Estado da Índia"), which had established bases in [Goa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa "Goa"), [Chittagong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong "Chittagong"), and [Bombay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay "Bombay"); Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [dowry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry "Dowry") of [Catherine of Braganza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Braganza "Catherine of Braganza") on her marriage to King [Charles II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England "Charles II of England"). The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch [United East India Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_East_India_Company "United East India Company") (VOC) on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China that helped secure EIC ports in China,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-39"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> independently attacking the Portuguese in the [Persian Gulf Residencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf_Residency "Persian Gulf Residency") primarily for political reasons.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> The company established [trading posts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_post "Trading post") in [Surat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat "Surat") (1619) and [Madras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai "Chennai") (1639).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cadell1956-41"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> By 1647, the company had 23 factories and settlements in India, and 90 employees.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-42"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Many of the major factories became some of the most populated and commercially influential cities in Bengal, including the walled forts of [Fort William](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_William,_India "Fort William, India") in Bengal, [Fort St George](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_St_George "Fort St George") in Madras, and [Bombay Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Castle "Bombay Castle").

The first century of the Company, despite its original profits coming primarily from piracy in the [Spice Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluku_Islands "Maluku Islands") between competing European powers and their companies,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> saw the East India Company change focus after suffering a major setback in 1623 when their factory in [Amboyna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amboyna_massacre "Amboyna massacre") in the Moluccas was attacked by the Dutch. This compelled the company to formally abandon their efforts in the Spice Islands, and turn their attention to Bengal where, by this time, they were making steady, if less exciting, profits.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> After gaining the indifferent patronage of the [Mughal Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire "Mughal Empire"), whose cities were 'the megacities of their time' and whose wealth was unrivaled outside of Asia in the 17th century,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> the Company's first century in the Mughal-ruled areas was spent cultivating their relationship with the Mughal Dynasty, and conducting peaceful trade at great profit. At first it should be said the EIC was drawn into the Mughal system, acting as a kind of vassal to Mughal authority in present-day Bangladesh: it was from this position that the Company would ultimately outplay and outmanoeuvre all competing powers in the region, to eventually use that very system to hold power itself.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> What started as trading posts on undesirable land were developed into sprawling factory complexes with hundreds of workers sending exotic goods to England and managing protected points to export English finished goods to local merchants. The Company's initial rise in Bengal and successes generally came at the expense of competing European powers through the art of currying favours and well-placed bribes, as the Company was matched at every step with French expansion in the region (whose [equivalent company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV%27s_East_India_Company "Louis XIV's East India Company") carried substantial royal support). Throughout the entire century the company only resorted to force against the Mughals once, with terrible consequences.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> The [Anglo-Mughal war (1686–1690)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Mughal_war_\(1686%E2%80%931690\) "Anglo-Mughal war (1686–1690)") was a complete defeat, ending when the EIC effectively swore fealty to the Mughals to get their factories back.

The East India Company's fortunes changed for the better in 1707 when Bengal and other regions under Mughal rule fell into anarchy after the death of the Mughal Emperor [Aurangzeb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb "Aurangzeb").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> A series of large-scale rebellions, and the collapse of the Mughal taxation system led to the effective independence of virtually all of the pre-1707 Mughal fiefs and holdings, with their capital Delhi routinely under the control of Maratha, Afghan, or usurper generals' armies. The EIC was able to take advantage of this chaos, slowly assuming direct control of the province of [Bengal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal"), and fighting [numerous wars against the French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_wars "Carnatic wars") for control of the east coast of the subcontinent. The Company's position in the Mughal court as it fell apart made it possible to sponsor various powerful people on the subcontinent as they individually contended with others, steadily amassing more land and power in India to themselves.

In the 18th Century, the primary source of the Company's profits in Bengal became taxation in conquered and controlled provinces, as the factories became fortresses and administrative hubs for networks of tax collectors that expanded into enormous cities. The Mughal Empire was the richest in the world in 1700, and the East India Company tried to strip it bare for a century thereafter. Dalrymple calls it "the single largest transfer of wealth until the Nazis." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> What was in the 17th century the production capital of the world for textiles was forced to become a market for British-made textiles. Statues, jewels, and various other valuables were moved from the palaces of Bengal to the townhouses of the English countryside. Bengal in particular suffered the worst of Company tax farming, highlighted by the [Great Bengal famine of 1770](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bengal_famine_of_1770 "Great Bengal famine of 1770").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>

The primary tool of expansion for the company was the Sepoy. The [Sepoys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy "Sepoy") were locally raised with European training and equipment, who changed warfare in present-day South Asia. Mounted forces and their superior mobility had been king on the region's battlefields for a thousand years, with cannon so well integrated that the Mughals fought with cannon mounted on elephants; all were no match to line infantry with decent discipline supported with field cannon. Repeatedly, a few thousand company sepoys fought vastly larger Mughal forces numerically and came out victorious. Afghan, Mughal and Maratha factions started creating their own European-style forces, often with French equipment, as the chaos intensified and the stakes were raised. Ultimately, the company won out, generally through as much diplomacy and state-craft as through fraud and deception. The gradual rise of the East India Company within the Mughal network culminated in the [Second Anglo-Maratha War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Maratha_War "Second Anglo-Maratha War"), in which the Company successfully ousted the Maratha, the Empire's official protectors, at the high water point in their rise to power, and installed a young Mughal Prince as Emperor, with the Company as the de jure protectors of the Empire from their position of direct control in Bengal. This relationship was repeatedly strained as the Company continued its expansion and exploitation, however it lasted in some form until 1858, when the last Mughal Emperor was exiled as the Company was disbanded and its assets were taken over by the British Crown.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Dalrymple2019-43"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1634, the Mughal emperor [Shah Jahan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan "Shah Jahan") extended his hospitality to English traders to [Bengal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal"), the richest region of the empire,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> and in 1717 customs duties were completely waived for the English in Bengal. By then, the Company's mainstay businesses were in cotton, silk, opium, [indigo dye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_dye "Indigo dye"), [saltpetre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate "Potassium nitrate") and tea. Meanwhile, the Dutch, the Company's most aggressive competitors, had expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [Straits of Malacca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca "Straits of Malacca") by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–1641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [Anglo-Dutch wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_wars "Anglo-Dutch wars") of the 17th and 18th centuries. The British were also interested in trans-Himalayan trade routes, as they would create access to untapped markets for British manufactured goods in Tibet and China.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> This economic interest was showcased by the [Anglo-Nepalese war (1814–1816).](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Nepalese_war "Anglo-Nepalese war")

Within the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or *Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie*, (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000 employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200 ships. It specialised in the spice trade and gave its shareholders 40% annual dividend.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup>

The British East India Company was fiercely competitive with the Dutch and French throughout the 17th and 18th centuries over spices from the [Spice Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Islands "Spice Islands"). Some spices, at the time, could only be found on these islands, such as nutmeg and cloves; and they could bring profits as high as 400 per cent from one voyage.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Suijk2015-47"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>

The tension was so high between the Dutch and the British East Indies Trading Companies that it escalated into at least four Anglo-Dutch wars:<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Suijk2015-47"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> 1652–1654, 1665–1667, 1672–1674 and 1780–1784.

Competition arose in 1635 when Charles I granted a trading licence to Sir [William Courteen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Courten "William Courten"), which permitted the rival [Courteen association](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courteen_association "Courteen association") to trade with the east at any location in which the EIC had no presence.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup>

In an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, King Charles II granted the EIC (in a series of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1689, a Mughal fleet commanded by [Sidi Yaqub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Yaqub "Sidi Yaqub") attacked Bombay. After a year of resistance the EIC surrendered in 1690, and the company sent envoys to [Aurangzeb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb "Aurangzeb") 's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future. The emperor withdrew his troops, and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-50"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>

The first of the [Anglo-Indian wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Indian_wars "Anglo-Indian wars") occurred in 1686 when the company conducted naval operations against [Shaista Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaista_Khan "Shaista Khan"), the governor of [Mughal Bengal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Bengal "Mughal Bengal"). This led to the siege of Bombay and the subsequent intervention of the Mughal Emperor, [Aurangzeb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb "Aurangzeb"). Subsequently, the English company was defeated and fined.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-57"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-58"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup>

**Mughal convoy piracy incident of 1695**

In September 1695, Captain [Henry Every](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Every "Henry Every"), an English pirate on board the [*Fancy*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_\(ship\) "Fancy (ship)"), reached the Straits of [Bab-el-Mandeb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb "Bab-el-Mandeb"), where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet returning from the annual pilgrimage to [Mecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca"). The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden *[Ganj-i-Sawai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganj-i-Sawai "Ganj-i-Sawai")*, reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean, and its escort, the *Fateh Muhammed*. They were spotted passing the straits en route to [Surat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat "Surat"). The pirates gave chase and caught up with the *Fateh Muhammed* some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some £40,000 of silver.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Burgess_2009-59"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 136–137">: 136–137 </span></sup> 

Every continued in pursuit and managed to overhaul *Ganj-i-Sawai*, which resisted strongly before eventually [striking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striking_the_colours "Striking the colours"). *Ganj-i-Sawai* carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the [Grand Mughal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangazeb "Aurangazeb"), though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. The loot from the *Ganj-i-Sawai* had a total value between £325,000 and £600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-60"><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup>

When the news arrived in England it caused an outcry. To appease Aurangzeb, the East India Company promised to pay all financial reparations, while [Parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom "Parliament of the United Kingdom") declared the pirates *[hostis humani generis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostis_humani_generis "Hostis humani generis")* ("the enemy of humanity"). In mid-1696 the government issued a £500 bounty on Every's head and offered a free pardon to any informer who disclosed his whereabouts. The first worldwide manhunt in recorded history was underway.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Burgess_2009-59"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 144">: 144 </span></sup> 

The plunder of Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. The furious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Sidi Yaqub and [Nawab Daud Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab_Daud_Khan "Nawab Daud Khan") to attack and close four of the company's factories in India and imprison their officers, who were almost lynched by a mob of angry [Mughals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_\(tribe\) "Mughal (tribe)"), blaming them for their countryman's depredations, and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his [Grand Vizier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier "Grand Vizier") [Asad Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asad_Khan_\(Mughal_noble\) "Asad Khan (Mughal noble)"), Parliament exempted Every from all of the [Acts of Grace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_grace_\(piracy\) "Acts of grace (piracy)") (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-61"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup>

The British began trading with China in 1699.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-62"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> This fact is recorded from the Chinese side in *[The Draft History of the Qing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingshi_gao "Qingshi gao")* under the year Kangxi 37 (1698).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> The apparent discrepancy between the British and Chinese sources can be explained by the fact that [Chinese New Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year "Chinese New Year") of 1699 did not fall until January 31, so that any treaties entered into in January would have been logged under Kangxi 37 rather than Kangxi 38. In 1715 the Company established a permanent "factory" in [Guangzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou") (Canton).<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-64"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company started selling opium to Chinese merchants in the 1770s in exchange for goods like [porcelain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain "Porcelain") and [tea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea "Tea"),<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-65"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> causing a series of [opioid addiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_use_disorder "Opioid use disorder") outbreaks across China in 1820.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-66"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> The ruling [Qing dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") outlawed the opium trade in 1796 and 1800,<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-67"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> but British merchants continued illegally nonetheless.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-68"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-69"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> The Qing took measures to prevent the East India Company from selling opium, and destroyed tens of thousands of chests of opium already in the country.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-70"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> This series of events led to the [First Opium War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War "First Opium War") in 1839, which involved a succession of British naval attacks along the Chinese coast over the course of several months. As part of the [Treaty of Nanjing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking "Treaty of Nanking") in 1842, the Qing were forced to give British merchants special treatment and the right to sell opium. The Chinese also ceded territory to the British, including the island of [Hong Kong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island "Hong Kong Island").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-71"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup>

The prosperity that the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and establish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power, such as seats in the House of Commons.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Guha2016-72"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup> Ship captains sold their appointments to successors for up to £500. As recruits aimed to return to Britain wealthy by securing Indian money, their loyalties to their homeland increased.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Guha2016-72"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company developed a [lobby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying "Lobbying") in the English parliament. Pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former company associates (pejoratively termed *Interlopers* by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, led to the passing of the deregulating act in 1694.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-victorianweb.org-73"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup>

This act allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. When the East India Company Act 1697 ([9 Will. 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Will._3 "9 Will. 3"). c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new "parallel" East India Company (officially titled the *English Company Trading to the East Indies*) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of £2 million.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Boggart-74"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of £315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-victorianweb.org-73"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup>

It quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced scarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new *United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies* being awarded by [Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Godolphin,_1st_Earl_of_Godolphin "Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-75"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> Under this arrangement, the merged company lent a sum of £3,200,000 to the Treasury, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the *United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies*.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-victorianweb.org-73"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup>

A constant battle between the company lobby and Parliament followed for decades. The company sought a permanent establishment, while Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-76"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup>

At this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of £1 million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [Seven Years' War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War "Seven Years' War") diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [defence of its territorial possessions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War "French and Indian War") in Europe and its [colonies in North America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_colonization_of_the_Americas "English colonization of the Americas").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-oxforddnb.com-77"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup>

The war partly took place in the Indian theatre, between the company troops and the French forces. In 1757, the [Law Officers of the Crown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Officers_of_the_Crown "Law Officers of the Crown") delivered the [Pratt–Yorke opinion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt%E2%80%93Yorke_opinion "Pratt–Yorke opinion") distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [right of conquest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_conquest "Right of conquest") from those acquired by private [treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty "Treaty"). The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-oxforddnb.com-77"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup>

With the advent of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its ever-growing cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market. In 1801 [Henry Dundas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dundas,_1st_Viscount_Melville "Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville") reported to the [House of Commons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom "House of Commons of the United Kingdom") that

He knew that [Samuel Pepys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Pepys "Samuel Pepys") and [John Evelyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Evelyn "John Evelyn") had amassed a substantial fortune from the [Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant") and Indian trades.

He became a director and later, as governor of the East India Company in 1672, he arranged a contract which included a loan of £20,000 and £30,000 worth of [saltpetre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate "Potassium nitrate") —also known as potassium nitrate, a primary ingredient in [gunpowder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") —for the King "at the price it shall [sell by the candle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_auction "Candle auction") "—that is by auction—where bidding could continue as long as an inch-long candle remained alight.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-79"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup>

Outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company. So high was the demand from armed forces that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales. One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-80"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup>

The Seven Years' War (1756–1763) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories.[Robert Clive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Clive "Robert Clive"), the Governor-General, led the company to a victory against [Joseph François Dupleix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fran%C3%A7ois_Dupleix "Joseph François Dupleix"), the commander of the French forces in India, and recaptured Fort St George from the French. The company took this respite to seize [Manila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_\(1762\) "Battle of Manila (1762)") in 1762.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-81"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup>

By the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1763\) "Treaty of Paris (1763)"), France regained the five establishments captured by the British during the war ([Pondichéry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry_district "Pondicherry district"), [Mahe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C3%A9,_India "Mahé, India"), [Karaikal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikal "Karaikal"), [Yanam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanam,_French_India "Yanam, French India") and [Chandernagar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandernagar "Chandernagar")) but was prevented from erecting fortifications and keeping troops in Bengal (art. XI). Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondichéry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.

In May 1772 the EIC stock price rose significantly. In June [Alexander Fordyce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fordyce "Alexander Fordyce") lost £300,000 [shorting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_\(finance\) "Short (finance)") EIC stock, leaving his partners liable for an estimated £243,000 in debts.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-82"><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup> As this information became public, 20–30 banks across Europe collapsed during the [British credit crisis of 1772-1773](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_credit_crisis_of_1772-1773 "British credit crisis of 1772-1773").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-83"><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-84"><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup> In India alone, the company had bill debts of £1.2 million.

> In September the company took out a loan from the Bank of England, to be repaid from the sale of goods later that month. But with buyers scarce, most of the sale had to be postponed, and when the loan fell due, the company's coffers were empty. On October 29 the bank refused to renew the loan. That decision set in motion a chain of events that made the American Revolution inevitable. The East India Company had eighteen million pounds of tea sitting in British warehouses. A huge amount of tea as assets which were lying unsold. Selling it in a hurry would do wonders for its finances.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-87"><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup>

On 14 January 1773 the directors of the EIC asked for a government loan and unlimited access to the tea market in the American colonies, both of which were granted.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-88"><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup> In August 1773 the [Bank of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") assisted the EIC with a loan.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-89"><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup>

The East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [Boston Tea Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party "Boston Tea Party") of 1773 in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [Thomas Hutchinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hutchinson_\(governor\) "Thomas Hutchinson (governor)") of the [Province of Massachusetts Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay "Province of Massachusetts Bay") refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain. This was one of the incidents which led to the [American Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution") and independence of the American colonies.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-90"><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company's trade monopoly with India was abolished in the [Charter Act 1813](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Act_1813 "Charter Act 1813"). The monopoly with China was ended in [1833](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena_Act_1833 "Saint Helena Act 1833"), ending the trading activities of the company and rendering its activities purely administrative.

In the aftermath of the [Indian Rebellion of 1857](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857 "Indian Rebellion of 1857") and under the provisions of the [Government of India Act 1858](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1858 "Government of India Act 1858"), the British Government nationalised the company. The British government took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its [armed forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_armies "Presidency armies").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Conquests-11"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company had already divested itself of its commercial trading assets in India in favour of the UK government in 1833, with the latter assuming the debts and obligations of the company, which were to be serviced and paid from tax revenue raised in India. In return, the shareholders voted to accept an annual dividend of 10.5%, guaranteed for forty years, likewise to be funded from India, with a final pay-off to redeem outstanding shares. The debt obligations continued beyond dissolution and were only extinguished by the UK government during the Second World War.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-91"><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup>

The company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of [Saint Helena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena "Saint Helena")) until the [East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Stock_Dividend_Redemption_Act_1873 "East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873") came into effect, on 1 January 1874.
