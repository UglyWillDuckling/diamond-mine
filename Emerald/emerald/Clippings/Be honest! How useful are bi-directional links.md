I wanna ask you about an honest assessment of bi-directional linking (both linked and unlined) in Obsidian or any other[[ Second Brain]] you might be using.

How useful has it proven to you? I’m interested mainly in **[[serendipitous]]** discovery and creativity.

Also, is there any plug-in to push [[Obsidian]] to find more unlinked/related blocks, perhaps using AI? I’m asking because Obsidian is only able to find unlinked references when exact words are used, not with similar concepts, let alone different languages (I’m bilingual). I think AI could really help a lot here.

> I believe bidirectional links (I'll call them backlinks because that's how I'm used to call them) are great to organize your thought process and organization. I'll mention some of my uses for backlinks down below:
> 
> \- Mention project notes in my daily note (which I use as a journal) so I'll have a log of when I edited it or not
> 
> \- Mention pages that are related, so I can see them whenever I need to re-visit my notes and learn more
> 
> \- Keep MOCs (Map of Contents) of project notes that only house the tasks for a particular project and a bunch of backlinks to useful resources and previous notes that will assist on the creation of even more resources and progress on the project
> 
> \- Allow for better discoverability of concepts and thoughts
> 
> I don't use Obsidian, but I found a plugin that has the functionality that I use a lot in my notes app - [Influx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6455628/196566154-404086ad-9a6c-49b0-bb5c-f7335090e2fb.png). With it, you can add the information from backlinked notes to the note you're currently in.

> This is only my own personal opinion. To me, links and backlinks, working in the present, serve primarily as an organisation tool. The real value is found over time.
> 
> Those “happy accident” and “insight-developing” qualities of links can only be discovered over the course of time. You have to forget what you wrote and rediscover it.
> 
> As to whether they are useful to me - they are, because I can use them for organisation and the creation of structures, outlines and indexes. As to what they are useful for in terms of a “Zettelkasten”-type mindset? Not yet. Not by a long shot. Maybe not for months or years yet. There are not enough ideas for them to communicate and start to “explain” or “interpret” or “communicate with” each other, and I have not had enough time to truly forget what I wrote yet.
> 
> As to whether AI should be used to discover links, I would exercise caution. AI cannot discover different contexts to your ideas that were not related to the subjects you were initially considering them in the light of when you wrote them. AI can only work with what you have given it. (This includes the work done and material given by others to train the AI.)
> 
> There is always more value in discovering things yourself. It becomes personal to you, and that’s where the strength is. Discovering things yourself may take more effort, time and frustration to accomplish but the value gained from those connections will eventually transcend their utility, because it ceases to be just a system, and starts to be a reflection of you. And you can talk with the past you to find out what future you needs to know.

> The core of my entire note system is bi-directional backlinks in a WikiLink format. They're the only reason I use Obsidian and I'm pleased that other apps have them now too.

> AI? AI is techbro garbage, overhyped and absolutely hostile to anyone who writes, makes images, or does anything creative, to enrich the billionaires, exploit workers, and create a second public commons for oligarchs. Incorporating it into my notes would betray why I enjoy taking notes and lessen my knowledge by polluting it with bad information and weakened mental connections

> depends on the use case of course, but I rarely deal with it for my home/creative work. I use a PARA organization and have a couple index/tag type pages but mostly a loose folder structure is all i need.
>

> 
> don’t know about a plugin that fits your ask but it seems like there are new AI plugins all the time. I shy away from them because it kills the “local only” aspect.
