The **Game Boy Color** (**GBC** or **CGB**) is an 8-bit [handheld game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console "Handheld game console"), manufactured by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo "Nintendo"), which was released in Japan on October 21, 1998, and to international markets that November. Compared to the original [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "Game Boy"), the Game Boy Color features a color [TFT screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFT_screen "TFT screen") rather than [monochrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome_monitor "Monochrome monitor"), a processor that can operate twice as fast, and four times as much memory. It retains [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") with games initially developed for its predecessor.

While the handheld was slightly thicker, taller and had a smaller screen than its immediate predecessor, the [Game Boy Pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Pocket "Game Boy Pocket"), the Color was significantly smaller than the original Game Boy. As with its predecessors, the Game Boy Color has a custom [8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit "8-bit") processor made by [Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Corporation "Sharp Corporation"). The [American English spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-our,_-or "American and British English spelling differences") of the system's name, *Game Boy Color*, remains consistent throughout the world.

While it received positive reviews upon its release, the Game Boy Color was seen as more of a transitional upgrade of the original Game Boy rather than a completely new device. It would have a relatively brief lifespan, being supplanted by the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance") after less than three years on the market.

The Game Boy Color is part of the [fifth generation of video game consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_of_video_game_consoles "Fifth generation of video game consoles"). The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide, making them the fourth [best-selling system of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles "List of best-selling game consoles"). Its best-selling games are [*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver "Pokémon Gold and Silver"), which shipped 23 million units worldwide.

When the original Game Boy was first introduced in 1989, many questioned why Nintendo had chosen to develop a monochrome handheld, considering competitors like the [Atari Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx "Atari Lynx") and [Sega Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Game_Gear "Sega Game Gear") boasted color screens. However, while these color displays were visually impressive, they led to criticism that the rival devices had poor battery life and were bulky. The Game Boy, in contrast, offered superior portability and longevity, propelling it to immense popularity.[^mcfarren_2016-1][^2] Publicly, Nintendo pledged to develop a color Game Boy, but only when technology limitations could be addressed.[^day_2016-3]

Internally, a team led by [Satoru Okada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Okada "Satoru Okada"), who played a key role in the original Game Boy's design, was experimenting with color displays. Their early-1990s prototype, codenamed "[Project Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance#Project_Atlantis "Game Boy Advance")," featured a color screen and a powerful 32-bit processor from Sharp. However, the team was not satisfied with the outcome and shelved further development.[^4][^kurokawa_2022-5]

Despite the lack of color, consumer interest in the Game Boy remained strong. In 1996, Nintendo released the slimmer [Game Boy Pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Pocket "Game Boy Pocket") and the launch of the [*Pokémon* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_\(video_game_series\) "Pokémon (video game series)") that same year further boosted sales.[^day_2016-3] But developers were losing interest in creating new games for the aging platform.[^6]

Additional market pressure for Nintendo came in October 1997 when news broke about [Bandai's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai "Bandai") new handheld, the [WonderSwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WonderSwan "WonderSwan"). The project was led by [Gunpei Yokoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi "Gunpei Yokoi"), the engineer who led the development of the [Game & Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Watch "Game & Watch") series and the original Game Boy. Yokoi had left Nintendo in 1996 following the commercial failure of his final project, the [Virtual Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy "Virtual Boy"). His departure caused a stir, with investors dumping Nintendo stock, forcing a temporary halt on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yokoi was killed in a roadside accident in 1997 before the WonderSwan's release.[^7]

Faced with mounting pressure, Okada revisited Project Atlantis. Prioritizing speed to market over processing power, he dropped the 32-bit chip for a faster version of the existing Game Boy's 8-bit processor that would allow for a quicker launch and maintain compatibility with the existing library of Game Boy games.[^kurokawa_2022-5]

The Game Boy Color was announced in March 1998 and released in Japan that October.[^8] It received an international rollout throughout November (amid the busy Christmas holiday shopping season), reaching North America on the 18th, Europe on the 23rd, and Australasia on the 27th. Launching at a price of US$79.95 (equivalent to $150 in 2023),[^9] the Game Boy Color ultimately outsold the WonderSwan, which went on sale in March 1999.[^10]

The Game Boy Color had a relatively short lifespan, being on the market for only two and a half years before being succeeded by the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance") in 2001. The successor finally brought the 32-bit processing power envisioned in Project Atlantis. Despite the new arrival, the Game Boy Color remained in production, serving as a budget-friendly alternative.[^day_2016-3] The last units were reportedly sold by March 2003.[^nintendo_2016-11]

The Game Boy Color motherboard  
([Annotated version](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-Motherboard-Bottom.jpg "commons:File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-Motherboard-Bottom.jpg"))

The Game Boy Color uses a custom [system on a chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip "System on a chip") (SoC), integrating the CPU and other major components into a single package, named the CPU CGB by Nintendo and manufactured by the [Sharp Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Corporation "Sharp Corporation"). While the CPU CGB was a new design for the Game Boy Color, the technology inside was largely an evolution of the then ten-year-old DMG-CPU SoC used inside the original Game Boy.

Within the CPU CGB, the main processor is a *Sharp SM83*,[^12] a hybrid between two other [8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing "8-bit computing") processors: the [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080 "Intel 8080") and the [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80 "Zilog Z80"). The SM83 has the seven 8-bit [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register "Processor register") of the 8080 (lacking the alternate registers of the Z80) but uses the Z80's programming syntax and extra [bit manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation "Bit manipulation") instructions, along with adding new instructions to optimize the processor for certain operations related to the way the hardware was arranged.[^13][^14] The Sharp SM83 also powered the original Game Boy, where it operates at a [clock rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate "Clock rate") of 4.194304 [megahertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megahertz "Megahertz") (MHz). Games on Game Boy Color exclusive cartridges can command the processor to operate in "dual-speed mode," doubling its frequency to run twice as fast at 8.388608 MHz. This allowed developers to get double the processing power out of the device when creating games exclusively for the Game Boy Color while allowing the hardware to retain [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") with existing games.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15] 

The CPU CGB incorporates the *Picture Processing Unit*, a basic [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU "GPU") that renders visuals using 16 [kilobytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte "Kilobyte") (KB) banks of [Video RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_RAM_\(dual-ported_DRAM\) "Video RAM (dual-ported DRAM)"), twice as much as the original Game Boy.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15]  Games developed specifically for the Game Boy Color could fully utilize this additional memory, enabling enhanced effects and displaying up to 56 colors simultaneously out of a selection of 32,768 colors.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15]  Programmers later developed the "high color mode" technique, which involved rapidly switching color palettes to display over 2,000 colors at once. This feature was utilized in games such as *The Fish Files*, *The New Addams Family Series* and *Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare*.[^ign_2000-16][^2kcolours-17] When a Game Pak for original Game Boy is inserted, the additional memory is disabled.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15] 

The display itself is a 2.3-inch (diagonal) [thin-film transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_transistor "Thin-film transistor") (TFT) color [liquid-crystal display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display "Liquid-crystal display") (LCD), measuring 44 millimeters (1.7 in) wide by 40 millimeters (1.6 in) high. The screen [aspect ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_\(image\) "Aspect ratio (image)") and resolution remain identical to the original Game Boy at 160 [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel "Pixel") wide by 144 pixels high in a 10:9 format. Like the original Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket before it and the Game Boy Advance after it, the screen is passively reflective, with a surface behind the screen that sends light back through the liquid crystal pixel elements to the viewer. Because there is no [backlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight "Backlight"), the device can be hard to use in dark environments.[^total_games_guide-18][^pavlacka_1998-19]

The SoC contains a 2 KB "bootstrap" ROM which is used to start up the device,[^20] 127 B of High RAM that can be accessed faster (similar to a [CPU cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache "CPU cache")), and the *Audio Processing Unit*, a [programmable sound generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_sound_generator "Programmable sound generator") with four channels: a [pulse wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_wave "Pulse wave") generation channel with frequency and volume variation, a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation, a wave channel than can reproduce any [waveform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform "Waveform") recorded in RAM, and a [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise "White noise") channel with volume variation.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15] [^gba_service_manual-21] The motherboard of the Game Boy Color contains a 32 KB "work" [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory") chip, four times more than the original Game Boy.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15] 

The Game Boy features a [D-pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad "D-pad") (directional pad), four action buttons labeled 'A,' 'B,' 'SELECT,' and 'START,' and a sliding on-off switch on the right side of the device. The volume is adjusted by a [potentiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer "Potentiometer") dial on the left side of the device.

The left side offers a [Game Link Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable "Game Link Cable") port for connecting to up to four Game Boy devices for multiplayer games or, notably in *Pokémon* series games, trading and battling.[^22] This port can be used with a [Game Boy Printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer "Game Boy Printer"). The port used on the Game Boy Color is of a smaller design first introduced on the Game Boy Pocket, and requires an adapter to link with the original Game Boy.[^23] The Game Boy Color also offered a "high-speed" mode that could operate up 64 times faster than the original Game Boy.[^game_boy_programming_manual-15]  The Game Boy Color added an infrared communications port for wireless data transfer, which was supported by a small number of games; the infrared port was not included on the later [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "Game Boy Advance") line.[^gba_service_manual-21]

Game Boy Color Game Pak

Games are stored on cartridges called [Game Boy Game Paks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Game_Pak "Game Boy Game Pak"), using [read-only memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory "Read-only memory") (ROM) chips. Initially, due to the limitations of the 8-bit architecture of the device, ROM size was limited to 32 KB. Nintendo overcame this limitation with a *Memory Bank Controller* (MBC) inside the cartridge. This chip sits between the processor and the ROM chips. The CPU can only access 32 KB at a time, but the MBC can switch between banks of 32 KB ROM. Using this technology, Nintendo created Game Boy Color games that use up to 8 [megabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte "Megabyte") in size. Game Paks can provide additional functionality to the Game Boy system. Some cartridges include up to 128 KB of RAM to increase performance, which can be battery-backed to save progress when the handheld is off, [real-time clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock "Real-time clock") chips can keep track of time even when the device is off, and [Rumble Pak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Pak "Rumble Pak") cartridges add vibration feedback to enhance gameplay.[^31][^game_boy_programming_manual-15] 

The Game Boy Color has backward compatibility with all original Game Boy games. Three main Game Pak cartridge types for the handheld were released:

Samples of the color palettes and the key combinations to select them on an original Game Pak.

**Original Game Boy Game Pak** (Gray Case): The classic Game Boy cartridges. The Game Boy Color applies a limited color palette (often dark green) using four to ten colors to enhance games originally intended to be presented in four shades of gray.[^32] The Game Boy Color's "bootstrap" ROM was programmed with default color palettes for many of the most popular titles. For games without a default, users can choose from 12 different palettes using button combinations.[^day_2016-3] A dedicated palette option replicates the original Game Boy's grayscale experience.

**Color enhanced Game Boy Game Pak** (Black Case): These cartridges can use the full-color capabilities of the console (56 colors simultaneously out of a palette of 32,768) while remaining compatible with the original Game Boy where they are presented in four shades of gray. This compatibility comes at the expense of not being able to utilize the handheld's increased processing speed and memory.[^day_2016-3]

**Game Boy Color Game Pak** (Clear Case): Designed specifically for the Game Boy Color, these cartridges feature the full-color range (56 colors simultaneously out of a palette of 32,768) and benefit from the increased processing speed and memory of the Game Boy Color.[^day_2016-3] Because of this reliance on newer hardware, these games are incompatible with the older monochrome Game Boy models.[^33]

Atomic Purple

Nintendo had seen success selling colored variations of the Play It Loud! Game Boy and the Game Boy Pocket, so the company released the Color in several case variations.[^day_2016-3]

The logo for Game Boy Color spells out the word "COLOR" in the five original colors in which the unit was manufactured: Berry (C), Grape (O), Kiwi (L), Dandelion (O), and Teal (R). Another color released at the same time was "Atomic Purple", made of a translucent purple plastic. Other colors were sold as limited editions or in specific countries.[^34]

Due to its backward compatibility with Game Boy games, the Game Boy Color launched with a large playable library. The system amassed a library of 576 Game Boy Color games over a four-year period. While the majority of the games are Game Boy Color exclusive, approximately 30% of the games released are compatible with the original Game Boy. Most Game Boy Color games released after 1999 are not compatible with the original Game Boy.[^35][^36][^37]

*[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_\(Game_Boy\) "Tetris (Game Boy)")* for the original Game Boy is the best-selling game compatible with Game Boy Color,[^38][^39] and [*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver "Pokémon Gold and Silver") are the best-selling games developed primarily for it. The best-selling Game Boy Color exclusive game is *[Pokémon Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Crystal "Pokémon Crystal")*.[^40][^41]

The last Game Boy Color game ever released is the Japanese exclusive *[Doraemon no Study Boy: Kanji Yomikaki Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doraemon_video_games "List of Doraemon video games")*, on July 18, 2003. The last game released in North America is *[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_\(video_game\) "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)")*, released on November 15, 2002.[^42] In Europe, the last game released for the system is *[Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamtaro:_Ham-Hams_Unite! "Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite!")*, on January 10, 2003.[^day_2016-3]

Beyond officially released games for the platform, there is an active online community creating new games for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color through the use of tools like GB Studio.[^43] One such example is Dragonhym (originally Dragonborne) which was available for release on a physical cartridge which will be playable on the Game Boy Color.[^44]

The [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "Game Boy") and Game Boy Color were both commercially successful, selling 118.69 million units worldwide: 32.47 million in Japan, 44.06 million in the Americas, and 42.16 million in all other regions.[^nintendo_2016-11][^45] At the time of its discontinuation in 2003, the combined sales of all Game Boy variants made it the [best-selling game console of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles "List of best-selling game consoles"). In later years, its sales were surpassed by the [Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS "Nintendo DS"), [PlayStation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2 "PlayStation 2") and [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch "Nintendo Switch"), making it the fourth-best-selling console the second-best-selling handheld of all time, as of 2024<sup class="plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update"><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_Boy_Color&amp;action=edit">[update]</a></sup>. Sales of the device were in part driven by the success of *[Pokémon Gold and Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver "Pokémon Gold and Silver")* and *[Pokémon Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Crystal "Pokémon Crystal")*, with combined sales of 29.5 million units, making them one of the [best selling-video games of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games "List of best-selling video games").[^46][^47]

Sales of the Game Boy Color were strong at launch. [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo "Nintendo") of America reported a sale of one million units from launch to December 1998,[^gaming_intelligence_1999-48] and two million by July 1999.[^49] Retail chains in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") reported unexpectedly high demand for the console, with executives of [FuncoLand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuncoLand "FuncoLand") reporting "very pleasant and unpredicted" sales and [Electronics Boutique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_Boutique "Electronics Boutique") stating "the entire Game Boy Color line just exploded, including accessories" upon release.[^50] Faced with high worldwide demand and competitive retail pricing, retailers such as [CompUSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA "CompUSA") sold out of Game Boy Color stock in the weeks before the 1998 Christmas season.[^gaming_intelligence_1999-48]

Reception of the Game Boy Color was positive, with critics praising the addition of color and improved clarity of the display.

Affiliated publications such as *Total Games* praised the handheld for its "bright, colorful picture that can be viewed in direct light", [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") features preserving the "vast catalogue of original Game Boy games", and improved technical performance.[^total_games_guide-18] *[Computer and Video Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_Video_Games "Computer and Video Games")* praised the Game Boy Color for making the Game Boy library of games "look better than ever – everything is crystal clear, bright and in \[color\]".[^51] Writing for *[GameSpot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot "GameSpot")*, Chris Johnston stated that the display was "crystal clear" and free of motion blur, stating that *[Tetris DX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_DX "Tetris DX")* was the "killer app" of the launch titles on the platform.[^52]

Milder reviews included those by *Arcade*, who said that while that the colors were "very impressive" they were "not as eyeball-popping as you might have hoped for \[...\] it's mostly seaweed greens, rusty browns, timid yellows and the like". They concluded that "nothing about \[the Game Boy Color\] is very radical" but said the device was "Game Boy as it always should have been".[^53] Reviewers pointed out other drawbacks including that the system was still using an 8-bit architecture when competitors had moved onto 16-bit handheld systems and that the non-backlit screen required that the user be in a well lit area.[^54][^pavlacka_1998-19]

Commentary on the legacy of the Game Boy Color has been shaped by the perception that the handheld was as an incremental and transitional upgrade of the Game Boy rather than a completely new device,[^fahs_2009-55][^carroll_2018-56] and had a relatively brief lifespan, being supplanted by the Game Boy Advance after two years, five months on the market.

In a history of Nintendo, author Jeff Ryan noted the Game Boy Color had a reputation as a "legacy machine" that found success mostly due to its backward compatibility, as "few wanted to lose all the *[Dr. Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Mario "Dr. Mario")* and *[Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon "Pokémon")* cartridges they had amassed over the years."[^57] Quoted in *[Retro Gamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Gamer "Retro Gamer")*, [Blitz Games Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_Games_Studios "Blitz Games Studios") developer Bob Pape acknowledged that although "backwards compatibility more or less defined (the) Game Boy Color", the handheld "ticked all the right boxes with regards to size, battery life, reliability and most importantly backwards compatibility".[^carroll_2018-56]

Positive assessments of the legacy of the Game Boy Color have focused on the merits of its game library, particularly for its third-party and import titles. Travis Fahs for *[IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN")* noted while "the Game Boy Color's life was relatively brief", it "built up a small library of excellent games", including *[Wario Land 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_Land_3 "Wario Land 3")* and *[Pokémon Gold and Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver "Pokémon Gold and Silver")*, and a "unique" and "previously unheard of" line of successful third-party games, including *[Dragon Warrior Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters "Dragon Warrior Monsters")*, *[Metal Gear Solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_\(2000_video_game\) "Metal Gear Solid (2000 video game)")* and *[Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Dark_Duel_Stories "Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories")*.[^fahs_2009-55] Ashley Day of *Retro Gamer* noted that the handheld had an "overlooked" status, stating "the Game Boy Color (has) an unfair reputation as the one Nintendo handheld with few worthwhile titles, but this simply isn't the case...returning to the Game Boy Color now reveals a wealth of great games that you never knew existed, especially those available on import."[^58]
