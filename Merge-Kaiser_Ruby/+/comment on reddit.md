[[That Funny Feeling ]]

https://www.reddit.com/r/boburnham/comments/npeadd/what_is_that_funny_feeling/

The lines are all related to [[cognitive dissonance]]. Even the joke lines like "obeying all the laws in GTA V" are about the tickle of doing something you weren't "supposed" to do. 

There's societal cognitive dissonance. "In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap" lampoons hyper-reality.
[[Hyper-reality]] is the absence of meaning and the over-proliferation of signs.
It's essentially replacing genuine belief with positions to identify oneself with for the sole sake of signalling virtue. It's Instagramming Free Palestine and it's opposing companies using child labor to make pride flags. **Even being against "the wrong thing" supports the media machine that has rendered us useless**. 

Then there's the psychological impact of living in this dissonance. Consuming a 24/7 news cycle, experiencing the flattening of mass shootings and war and probiotic smoothies into one newsfeed, watching our eroding social institutions, fragmenting minds, and our **unwillingness to stop engaging for even a second.**
The self-awareness, that last spark of cognitive dissonance telling us something is wrong, and our total numbness to it, our helplessness against it--that is the funny feeling.
