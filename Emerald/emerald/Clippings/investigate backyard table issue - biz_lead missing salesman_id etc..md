data is missing on leads.

**possible vectors**

- deprecated route:
- `core_user`: contains the `salesman_id`, possibly transferred to the `lead` entity

# core user

## updates of `user`

share/class.user.inc
 - **only in**  in `update_salesman_affectation`

## updates of `lead`

share/class.lead.inc
- **only** `set_salesman`


# how the `salesman_id` is updated on contact(user)

The salesman info comes from the `project`.

Whenever one of the projects belonging to a contact is updated, the update of the salesman is triggered.

‚ö† Be careful, this **doesn't** mean that the `salesman` from the `project` being updated is assigned, reather, the method will take the **first** project it can find belonging to that user and assign the `salesman_id`from it to the `user`.

update triggers inside of `project`
