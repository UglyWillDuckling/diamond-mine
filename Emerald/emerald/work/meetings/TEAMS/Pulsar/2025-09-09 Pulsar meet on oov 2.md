## discussion 🗨

### what should we do on the set agency visit?


**accepted**
1. follow the old procedure
2. send the confirmation mail to agency

**rejected**
1. create BY task for Backoffice

- this might be trickier than we thought.

### update our API call

- we might remove the **director** field this
	- SMS team has issues with dynamic value
