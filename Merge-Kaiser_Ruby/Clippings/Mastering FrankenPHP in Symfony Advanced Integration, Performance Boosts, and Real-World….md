**Symfony** is one of the most powerful PHP frameworks, but when it comes to optimizing performance and deploying applications efficiently, but traditional setups with Nginx or Apache can be limiting.  
If you want **blazing-fast request handling, built-in concurrency, and a seamless deployment strategy**, integrating FrankenPHP into your Symfony project can be a game-changer. In this guide I will share with you an **advanced integration** of FrankenPHP in a Symfony application, covering **real-world use cases**, **performance optimizations**, and **deployment strategies**.

## Why FrankenPHP Will Make You Rethink Your Stack‚ùì

FrankenPHP isn‚Äôt just another PHP runtime ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full-stack powerhouse that:

- ‚úîÔ∏èEmbeds PHP directly in a Go web server (bye-bye Nginx/PHP-FPM overhead). FrankenPHP removes the traditional web server bottleneck, allowing direct request handling within the PHP runtime.  
	This results in:  
	**Lower latency** (no need for FastCGI communication)  
	**Better concurrency** (leveraging Go‚Äôs event-driven architecture) **Less overhead** (simplified request pipeline)
- ‚úîÔ∏èDelivers native HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support out of the box
- ‚úîÔ∏èFrankenPHP makes **real-time communication easy**, integrating WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE) natively without additional WebSocket servers.
- ‚úîÔ∏èOffers automatic SSL via Caddy (yes, automatic HTTPS)
- ‚úîÔ∏èProvides built-in worker mode for serious throughput, reducing cold starts and improving execution speed for high-traffic applications.
- ‚úîÔ∏èWith FrankenPHP, **Symfony apps run as self-contained binaries**, making deployment similar to Go or Rust applications. No need to manage web servers separately ‚Äî just run the binary, and your app is live.

## üõ†Ô∏èInstall and configure FrankenPHP

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- **Symfony 6 or later** installed
- **PHP 8.2+** (recommended for best performance)
