about:: [[project]] [[ticket]] [[task]]

With this organization [[ticket]]'s can be quite large as they don't have to match with a task and can instead function partly as taks containers. This can allow the ticket to function almost like a project in itself.

In a different scenario, the ticket could be matched with a task directly if the depth is not needed. This would only involve creating a new task inside the ticket itself.
