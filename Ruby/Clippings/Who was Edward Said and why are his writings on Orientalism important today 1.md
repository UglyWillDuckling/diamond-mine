As Israel’s war in Gaza rages and its settlement expansion accelerates in the West Bank, one man’s critiques of Israel, the PLO, and Orientalism have proven to be precise even twenty years after his death.  
  
The world-renowned Palestinian-American academic [[Edward Said]] was born to Christian parents in Jerusalem in 1935 but fled his home along with his family in 1947 in the lead-up to the creation of Israel in 1948.  
  
He went on to write several books on music, media representation, literature, and colonialism, including Orientalism - said to be one of the most influential texts of the 20th century.  
  
So who exactly was Edward Said and how is his legacy prevalent today?
