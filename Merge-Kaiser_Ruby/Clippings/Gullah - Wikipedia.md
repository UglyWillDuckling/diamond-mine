This article is about the Gullah people and their culture and diaspora. For other uses, see [Gullah (disambiguation)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_\(disambiguation\) "Gullah (disambiguation)").

The **Gullah** () are a subgroup of the [African American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans "African Americans") ethnic group, who predominantly live in the [Lowcountry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Lowcountry "South Carolina Lowcountry") region of the U.S. states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida within the coastal plain and the [Sea Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Islands "Sea Islands"). [Their language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_language "Gullah language") and culture have preserved a significant influence of [Africanisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanisms "Africanisms") as a result of their historical geographic isolation and the community's relation to its shared history and identity.[^2]

Historically, the Gullah region extended from the [Cape Fear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_\(headland\) "Cape Fear (headland)") area on North Carolina's coast south to the vicinity of [Jacksonville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida "Jacksonville, Florida") on Florida's coast. The Gullah people and their language are also called **Geechee**, which may be derived from the name of the [Ogeechee River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogeechee_River "Ogeechee River") near [Savannah, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia "Savannah, Georgia").[^gomez2000-3] *Gullah* is a term that was originally used to designate the [creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language "Creole language") dialect of English spoken by Gullah and Geechee people. Over time, its speakers have used this term to formally refer to their creole language and distinctive ethnic identity as a people. The Georgia communities are distinguished by identifying as either "Freshwater Geechee" or "Saltwater Geechee", depending on whether they live on the mainland or the Sea Islands.[^morgan2011-4][^baileyharris2003-5][^nps2003-6][^nps-7]

Because of a period of relative isolation from whites while working on large [plantations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South "Plantations in the American South") in rural areas, the Africans, enslaved from a variety of Central and West African ethnic groups, developed a creole culture that has preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural heritage from various peoples; in addition, they absorbed new influences from the region. According to the Gullah/Geechee Nation website, many Gullah/Geechees also have some native American or indigenous American ancestry. The Gullah people speak an [English-based creole language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-based_creole_language "English-based creole language") containing many African [loanwords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanwords "Loanwords") and influenced by [African languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_languages "African languages") in grammar and sentence structure. Sometimes referred to as "Sea Island Creole" by linguists and scholars, the Gullah language is sometimes considered as being similar to [Bahamian Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamian_Creole "Bahamian Creole"), [Barbadian Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbadian_Creole "Barbadian Creole"), [Guyanese Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyanese_Creole "Guyanese Creole"), [Belizean Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belizean_Creole "Belizean Creole"), [Jamaican Patois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Patois "Jamaican Patois"), [Trinidadian Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidadian_Creole "Trinidadian Creole"), [Tobagonian Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobagonian_Creole "Tobagonian Creole"), and the [Sierra Leone Krio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krio_language "Krio language") language of [West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa"). Gullah crafts, farming and fishing traditions, folk beliefs, music, rice-based cuisine and story-telling traditions all exhibit strong influences **from Central and West African cultures**.[^prahlad2016-9][^shujaashujaa2015-10][^berry2012-11][^nps200350%e2%80%9358-12]

The origin of the word *Gullah* can be traced to the Kikongo language, spoken around the [Congo River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_River "Congo River")'s mouth, from which the [Gullah language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_language "Gullah language") dialects spoken by black Americans today come. Some scholars suggest that it may be [[cognate]] with the name *[Angola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola "Angola")*, where the ancestors of many of the Gullah people originated.[^gomez2000-3][^sumpter2006-13] Shipping records from the [Port of Charleston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Charleston "Port of Charleston") revealed that Angolans accounted for 39% of all enslaved Africans shipped to the port.[^:0-14] The story of [Gullah Jack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_Jack "Gullah Jack") (an African slave trafficked from Angola to the United States) further supports the theory that the word *Gullah* originated in Angola.[^rodriguez1997-15]

Some scholars also have suggested that it may come from the name of the [Gola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gola_people "Gola people"), an ethnic group living in the border area between present-day Sierra Leone and [Liberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia "Liberia") in West Africa, another area of enslaved ancestors of the Gullah people.[^opala2006-16][^gomez2000-3] British planters in the Caribbean and the Southern colonies of North America referred to this area as the "Grain Coast" or "Rice Coast"; many of the tribes are of [Mandé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mand%C3%A9 "Mandé") or Manding origins. The name "Geechee", another common name for the Gullah people, may derive from the name of the [Kissi people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissi_people "Kissi people"), an ethnic group living in the border area between Sierra Leone, [Guinea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea "Guinea"), and Liberia.[^gomez2000-3]

Another possible linguistic source for "Gullah" are the [Dyula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyula_people "Dyula people") ethnic group of West Africa, from whom the American Gullah might be partially descended.[^17] The [Dyula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyula_people "Dyula people") civilization had a large territory that stretched from Senegal through Mali to Burkina Faso and the rest of what was [French West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_West_Africa "French West Africa"). These were vast savanna lands with lower population densities. Slave raiding was easier and more common here than in forested areas with natural forms of physical defenses. The word "[Dyula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyula_people "Dyula people")" is pronounced "Gwullah" among members of the [Akan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akan_people "Akan people") ethnic group in [Ghana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana "Ghana") and [Côte d'Ivoire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire "Côte d'Ivoire").[^18] The primary land route through which captured [Dyula people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyula_people "Dyula people") then came into contact with European slavers was the "Grain Coast" and "Rice Coast" (present-day Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegambia, and Guinea).

One scholar suggested that the Gullah-Geechee name could have also been adopted from the [Ogeechee River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogeechee_River "Ogeechee River").[^matory2015-19] [Sapelo Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapelo_Island "Sapelo Island"), the site of the last Gullah community of [Hog Hammock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hog_Hammock "Hog Hammock"), was also a principal place of refuge for Guale people who fled slavery on the mainland.[^20]

The Gullah language has several West African words.

According to Port of Charleston records, African slaves shipped to the port came from the following areas: [Angola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola "Angola") (39%), [Senegambia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegambia "Senegambia") (20%), the [Windward Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Coast "Windward Coast") (17%), the [Gold Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_\(region\) "Gold Coast (region)") (13%), [Sierra Leone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone "Sierra Leone") (6%), the [Bight of Benin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_of_Benin "Bight of Benin") and [Bight of Biafra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_of_Biafra "Bight of Biafra") (5% combined), [Madagascar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar") and [Mozambique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique "Mozambique").[^:0-14][^21]

Particularly along the western coast, the local peoples had cultivated [African rice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_rice "African rice"), related to but distinct from [Asian rice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_rice "Asian rice"), for what is estimated to approach 3,000 years. It was originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper [Niger River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_River "Niger River").[^linares-22][^genome-23] Once Carolinian and Georgian planters in the American South discovered that African rice would grow in that region, they often sought enslaved Africans from rice-growing regions because they had the skills and knowledge needed to develop and build irrigation, dams and earthworks.[^opala2006b-24]

His counterpart in Britain was the Scottish merchant and slave trader [Richard Oswald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Oswald_\(merchant\) "Richard Oswald (merchant)"). Many of the enslaved Africans taken in West Africa were processed through Bunce Island, a prime export site for slaves to South Carolina and Georgia. Slave castles in Ghana, by contrast, shipped many of the people they traded to ports and markets in the Caribbean islands.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

After Freetown, Sierra Leone, was founded in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor black people from London and [black Loyalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Loyalists "Black Loyalists") from Nova Scotia resettled after the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"). The British did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone, protecting the people from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States prohibited the African [slave trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery "History of slavery"). After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to [intercept slave ships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Africa "Blockade of Africa") off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at [Liberia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia "Liberia"), a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the [American Colonization Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society "American Colonization Society").

### Origin of Gullah culture

 The Gullah region once extended from SE North Carolina to NE Florida

The Gullah people have been able to preserve much of their African cultural heritage because of climate, geography, cultural pride, and patterns of importation of enslaved Africans. The peoples who contributed to Gullah culture included the [Bakongo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongo_people "Kongo people"), [Mbundu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambundu "Ambundu"), [Vili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vili_people "Vili people"), [Yombe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yombe_people "Yombe people"), [Yaka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaka_people "Yaka people"), [Pende](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pende_people "Pende people"),[^25] [Mandinka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandinka_people "Mandinka people"), [Kissi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissi_people "Kissi people"), [Fulani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_people "Fula people"), [Mende](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mende_people "Mende people"), [Wolof](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolof_people "Wolof people"), [Kpelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kpelle_people "Kpelle people"), [Temne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temne_people "Temne people"), [Limba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limba_people_\(Sierra_Leone\) "Limba people (Sierra Leone)"), [Dyula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyula_people "Dyula people"), [Susu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susu_people "Susu people"), and the [Vai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vai_people "Vai people").[^:0-14]

By the middle of the 18th century, thousands of acres in the [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(U.S._state\) "Georgia (U.S. state)") and [South Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina "South Carolina") Lowcountry, and the Sea Islands were developed as [African rice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_rice "African rice") fields. African farmers from the "Rice Coast" brought the skills for cultivation and tidal irrigation that made rice farming one of the most successful industries in early America.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The subtropical climate encouraged the spread of [malaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria "Malaria") and [yellow fever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever "Yellow fever"), which were both carried and transmitted by mosquitoes. These tropical diseases were [endemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_\(epidemiology\) "Endemic (epidemiology)") in Africa and might have been carried by enslaved Africans to the colonies.[^26] Mosquitoes in the swamps and inundated rice fields of the Lowcountry picked up and spread the diseases to European [settlers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler "Settler"), as well. Malaria and yellow fever soon became endemic in the region.

Because they had acquired some [immunity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_\(medical\) "Immunity (medical)") in their homeland, Africans were more resistant to these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import enslaved Africans. By about 1708, South Carolina had a black majority.[^27] [Coastal Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Isles_of_Georgia "Golden Isles of Georgia") developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant.[^opala2006b-24] Others lived mostly in cities such as Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The planters left their European or African "rice drivers", or overseers, in charge of [the rice plantations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_production_in_the_United_States#Early_history "Rice production in the United States").[^opala2006b-24] These had hundreds of laborers, with African traditions reinforced by new imports from the same regions. Over time, the Gullah people developed a creole culture in which elements of African languages, cultures, and community life were preserved to a high degree. Their culture developed in a distinct way, different from that of the enslaved African Americans in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, where the enslaved lived in smaller groups, and had more sustained and frequent interactions with whites and British American culture.[^cassidy2020-28]

In late 2024 underwater [sonar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar "Sonar") was used to map 45 previously unknown irrigation devices used to control water flow for rice fields in conjunction with earthen dams and levees, developed by the Gullah Geechee over an area of 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of the northern end of Eagles Island, North Carolina, US. This provided evidence of the Gullah Geechee engineering and technological skills used for rice cultivation.[^29]

When the [U.S. Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") began, the Union rushed to blockade [Confederate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America") shipping. White planters on the Sea Islands, fearing an invasion by the US naval forces, abandoned their plantations and fled to the mainland. When Union forces arrived on the Sea Islands in 1861, they found the Gullah people eager for their freedom, and eager as well to defend it. Many Gullah served with distinction in the [Union Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army "Union Army")'s [First South Carolina Volunteers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_South_Carolina_Volunteers "First South Carolina Volunteers"). The Sea Islands were the first place in the South where slaves were freed. Long before the War ended, [Unitarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Unitarian_Association "American Unitarian Association") missionaries from [Pennsylvania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania") came to start schools on the islands for the newly freed slaves. [Penn Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Center_\(Saint_Helena_Island,_South_Carolina\) "Penn Center (Saint Helena Island, South Carolina)"), now a Gullah community organization on [Saint Helena Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena_Island,_South_Carolina "Saint Helena Island, South Carolina"), South Carolina, was founded as the first school for freed slaves.[^30]

After the Civil War ended, the Gullahs' isolation from the outside world increased in some respects. The rice planters on the mainland gradually abandoned their plantations and moved away from the area because of labor issues and hurricane damage to crops. Free blacks were unwilling to work in the dangerous and disease-ridden rice fields. A series of [hurricanes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_Sea_Islands_Hurricane "1893 Sea Islands Hurricane") devastated the crops in the 1890s. Left alone in remote rural areas of the Lowcountry, the Gullah continued to practice their traditional culture with little influence from the outside world well into the 20th century.[^31][^32][^33][^34]

### Since late 20th century

In the 20th century, some plantations were redeveloped as resort or hunting destinations by wealthy whites.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Gradually more visitors went to the islands to enjoy their beaches and mild climate. Since the late 20th century, the Gullah people—led by Penn Center and other determined community groups—have been fighting to keep control of their traditional lands. Since the 1960s, resort development on the Sea Islands greatly increased property values, threatening to push the Gullah off family lands which they have owned since [emancipation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation "Emancipation Proclamation"). They have fought back against uncontrolled development on the islands through community action, the courts, and the political process.[^35]

The Gullah have also struggled to preserve their traditional culture in the face of much more contact with modern culture and media. In 1979, a translation of the [New Testament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") into the Gullah language was begun.[^36] The [American Bible Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bible_Society "American Bible Society") published *De Nyew Testament* in 2005. In November 2011, *Healin fa de Soul*, a five-CD collection of readings from the Gullah Bible, was released.[^37][^38] This collection includes *Scipcha Wa De Bring Healing* ("Scripture That Heals") and the [Gospel of John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") (*De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa John Write*). This was the most extensive collection of Gullah recordings, surpassing those of [Lorenzo Dow Turner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Dow_Turner "Lorenzo Dow Turner"). The recordings have helped people develop an interest in the culture, because they get to hear the language and learn how to pronounce some words.[^39]

The Gullah achieved another victory in 2006 when the U.S. Congress passed the "[Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah/Geechee_Cultural_Heritage_Corridor "Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor")"; it provided [US$](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%24 "US$")10 million over 10 years for the preservation and interpretation of historic sites in the Low Country relating to Gullah culture.[^40] The Act provides for a [Heritage Corridor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Heritage_Area "National Heritage Area") to extend from southern North Carolina to northern Florida in a project administered by the US [National Park Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service "National Park Service") with extensive consultation with the Gullah community.

The Gullah have also been in contact with [West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa"). Gullah groups made three celebrated "homecomings" to [Sierra Leone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone "Sierra Leone") in 1989, 1997, and 2005. Sierra Leone is at the heart of the traditional rice-growing region of West Africa where many of the Gullahs' ancestors originated. [Bunce Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunce_Island "Bunce Island"), the British slave castle in Sierra Leone, sent many African captives to Charleston and Savannah during the mid- and late 18th century. These dramatic homecomings were the subject of three documentary films—*Family Across the Sea* (1990), *The Language You Cry In* (1998), and *Priscilla's Legacy*.[^41]

- Gullah beliefs about "[hags](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_Hag "Boo Hag")" and "haunts" are similar to African beliefs about malevolent ancestors, [witches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft "Witchcraft"), and "devils" (forest spirits).
- Gullah "[root doctors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_\(folk_magic\) "Hoodoo (folk magic)")" protect their clients against dangerous spiritual forces by using [ritual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual "Ritual") objects similar to those employed by African [traditional healers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_doctor "Witch doctor").

- An African song, preserved by a Gullah family in coastal Georgia, was identified in the 1940s by linguist Lorenzo Turner and found to be a [Mende](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mende_people "Mende people") song from Sierra Leone. It is probably the longest text in an African language to survive the transatlantic crossing of enslaved Africans to the present-day United States. Later, in the 1990s, researchers Joseph Opala, Cynthia Schmidt, and Taziff Koroma located a remote village in Sierra Leone where the song is still sung today, and determined it is a funeral hymn. This research and the resulting reunion between a Gullah family and a Mende family that have both retained versions of the song is recounted in the documentary *The Language You Cry In* (1998).[^43]

 [Sea Island red peas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Island_red_pea "Sea Island red pea"), an heirloom variety of cowpeas grown by the Gullah

The Gullah have preserved many of their west African food ways growing and eating crops such as [Sea island red peas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Island_red_pea "Sea Island red pea"), [Carolina Gold rice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Gold "Carolina Gold"), Sea island Benne, Sea island Okra, [sorghum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum_bicolor "Sorghum bicolor"), and [watermelon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon "Watermelon") all of which were brought with them from [West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa").[^47][^48] Rice is a staple food in Gullah communities and continues to be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures.

Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah [food system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_system "Food system"): a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.[^49]

The first high-profile book on Gullah cooking[^50] was published in 2022 by [Emily Meggett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Meggett "Emily Meggett"), an 89-year-old Gullah cook.[^51]

### Celebrating Gullah culture

Over the years, the Gullah have attracted study by many [historians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian "Historian"), [linguists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist "Linguist"), [folklorists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklorist "Folklorist"), and [anthropologists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist "Anthropologist") interested in their rich cultural heritage. Many academic books on that subject have been published. The Gullah have also become a symbol of cultural pride for blacks throughout the United States and a subject of general interest in the media.[^52] Numerous newspaper and magazine articles, documentary films, and children's books on Gullah culture, have been produced, in addition to popular novels set in the Gullah region. In 1991 [Julie Dash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Dash "Julie Dash") wrote and directed *[Daughters of the Dust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_the_Dust "Daughters of the Dust")*, the first feature film about the Gullah, set at the turn of the 20th century on St. Helena Island. Born into a Gullah family, she was the first African-American woman director to produce a feature film.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Gullah people now organize cultural [festivals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival "Festival") every year in towns up and down the Lowcountry. [Hilton Head Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Head_Island,_South_Carolina "Hilton Head Island, South Carolina"), for instance, hosts a "Gullah Celebration" in February. It includes "De Aarts ob We People" show; the "Ol’ Fashioned Gullah Breakfast"; "National Freedom Day," the "Gullah Film Fest", "A Taste of Gullah" food and entertainment, a "Celebration of Lowcountry Authors and Books," an "Arts, Crafts & Food Expo," and "De Gullah Playhouse". [Beaufort](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort,_South_Carolina "Beaufort, South Carolina") hosts the oldest and the largest celebration, "The Original Gullah Festival" in May. The nearby Penn Center on [St. Helena Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Helena_Island,_South_Carolina "St. Helena Island, South Carolina") holds "Heritage Days" in November. Other Gullah festivals are celebrated on [James Island, South Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Island,_South_Carolina "James Island, South Carolina"), and [Sapelo Island, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapelo_Island "Sapelo Island").<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Gullah culture is also being celebrated elsewhere in the United States. The [High Art Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Art_Museum "High Art Museum") in Atlanta has presented exhibits about Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center at [Purdue University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University "Purdue University") in [West Lafayette, Indiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lafayette,_Indiana "West Lafayette, Indiana") conducted a research tour, cultural arts festival, and other related events to showcase the Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center Library maintains a bibliography of Gullah books and materials, as well. [Metro State College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_State_College "Metro State College") in [Denver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver "Denver"), [Colorado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado"), hosted a conference on Gullah culture, called *The Water Brought Us: Gullah History and Culture,* which featured a panel of Gullah scholars and cultural activists. These events in Indiana and Colorado are typical of the attention Gullah culture regularly receives throughout the United States.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Gullah culture has proven to be particularly resilient. Gullah traditions are strong in the rural areas of the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and among their people in urban areas such as Charleston and Savannah. Gullah people who have left the Lowcountry and moved far away have also preserved traditions; for instance, many Gullah in New York, who went North in the [Great Migration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_\(African_American\) "Great Migration (African American)") of the first half of the 20th century, have established their own neighborhood churches in [Harlem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem "Harlem"), [Brooklyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn"), and [Queens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens "Queens"). Typically they send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia during the summer months to live with grandparents, uncles, and aunts. Gullah people living in New York frequently return to the Lowcountry to retire. Second- and third-generation Gullah in New York often maintain many of their traditional customs and many still speak the Gullah language.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The Gullah custom of painting porch ceilings [haint blue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haint_blue "Haint blue") to deter haints, or [ghosts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost "Ghost"), survives in the American South. It has also been adopted by [White Southerners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Southerners "White Southerners").[^53]

*[Gullah Gullah Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_Gullah_Island "Gullah Gullah Island")* is an American musical children's television series that was produced by and aired on the Nick Jr. programming block on the Nickelodeon network from October 24, 1994, to April 7, 1998. The show was hosted by Ron Daise—now the former vice president for Creative Education at Brookgreen Gardens in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina—and his wife Natalie Daise, both of whom also served as cultural advisors, and were inspired by the Gullah culture of Ron Daise's home of St. Helena Island, South Carolina, part of the Sea Islands.
