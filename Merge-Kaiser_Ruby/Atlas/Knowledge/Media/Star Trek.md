***Star Trek*** is an American [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") [media franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise "Media franchise") created by [[Gene Roddenberry]], which began with the [series of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series "Star Trek: The Original Series") and became a worldwide [pop-culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture "Popular culture") [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_influence_of_Star_Trek "Cultural influence of Star Trek"). Since its creation, the franchise has expanded into [various films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_films "List of Star Trek films"), [television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_television_series "List of Star Trek television series"), [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_games "List of Star Trek games"), [novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_novels "List of Star Trek novels"), and [comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_\(comics\) "Star Trek (comics)"), and it has become one of the most recognizable and [highest-grossing media franchises of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises "List of highest-grossing media franchises").[^9] [^10] [^11]

The franchise began with *[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series "Star Trek: The Original Series")* (*The Original Series*), which premiered on September 6, 1966, on Canada's [CTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network "CTV Television Network") network.[^12] In the US it debuted on September 8, 1966, on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC"). The series followed the voyages of the crew of the [starship USS *Enterprise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise "Starship Enterprise"), a space exploration vessel built by the [United Federation of Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets "United Federation of Planets") in the 23rd century, on a mission "to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go [where no man has gone before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_no_man_has_gone_before "Where no man has gone before") ". In creating *Star Trek*, Roddenberry was inspired by [C. S. Forester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Forester "C. S. Forester") 's [Horatio Hornblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Hornblower "Horatio Hornblower") series of novels, [Jonathan Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift "Jonathan Swift") 's 1726 novel *[Gulliver's Travels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels "Gulliver's Travels")*, the 1956 film *[Forbidden Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Planet "Forbidden Planet")*, and television [westerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_\(genre\) "Western (genre)") such as *[Wagon Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_Train "Wagon Train")*.

The [*Star Trek* canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_canon "Star Trek canon") includes the *Original Series*, 11 spin-off television series, and [a film franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_\(film_series\) "Star Trek (film series)"); further adaptations also exist in several media. After the conclusion of the *Original Series*, the adventures of its characters continued in *[The Animated Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Animated_Series "Star Trek: The Animated Series")*, and six feature films. A television revival beginning in the late 1980s and concluding in the mid 2000s saw four spinoff series: *[The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation "Star Trek: The Next Generation")*, following the crew of a new starship *Enterprise* a century after the original series; *[Deep Space Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Nine "Deep Space Nine")* and *[Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager "Star Trek: Voyager")*, set in the same era as the *Next Generation*; and *[Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise "Star Trek: Enterprise")*, set a century before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The adventures of the *Next Generation* crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_\(fiction\) "Reboot (fiction)"), creating an alternate continuity known as the *Kelvin* timeline; three films have been set in this continuity. The newest *Star Trek* television revival, beginning in 2017 and set in the original continuity, includes the series *[Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery "Star Trek: Discovery")*, *[Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard "Star Trek: Picard")*, *[Short Treks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Short_Treks "Star Trek: Short Treks")*, *[Lower Decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Lower_Decks "Star Trek: Lower Decks")*, *[Prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Prodigy "Star Trek: Prodigy")*, and *[Strange New Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Strange_New_Worlds "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds")*, [streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television "Streaming television") on digital platforms.

*Star Trek* has been a [cult phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_phenomenon "Cult phenomenon") for decades.[^13] Fans of the franchise are called " [Trekkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie "Trekkie") " or "Trekkers". The franchise spans a wide range of [spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_spin-off_fiction "Star Trek spin-off fiction") including [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_games "Star Trek games"), figurines, [novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_novels "List of Star Trek novels"), toys, and [comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_\(comics\) "Star Trek (comics)"). From 1998 to 2008, there was [a *Star Trek* –themed attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Experience "Star Trek: The Experience") in [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley "Las Vegas Valley"). At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language") [Klingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language "Klingon language") was created for the franchise. Several *Star Trek* parodies have been made, and viewers have produced several [fan productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_fan_productions "Star Trek fan productions").

*Star Trek* is noted for [its cultural influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_influence_of_Star_Trek "Cultural influence of Star Trek") beyond works of science fiction.[^14] The franchise is also notable for its progressive stances on [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights "Civil rights").[^15] *The Original Series* included one of the first multiracial casts on US television.

As early as **1964**, [Gene Roddenberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry "Gene Roddenberry") drafted a proposal for the science fiction series that would become *Star Trek*. Although he publicly marketed it as a [Western in outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Western "Space Western") —a so-called " *[Wagon Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_Train "Wagon Train")* to the stars"—he privately told friends that he was modeling it on [Jonathan Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift "Jonathan Swift") 's *[Gulliver's Travels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels "Gulliver's Travels")*, intending each episode to act on two levels: as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale.[^16] [^17] [^18] [^19]

Most *Star Trek* stories depict the adventures of humans and aliens who serve in [Starfleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet "Starfleet"), the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the [United Federation of Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets "United Federation of Planets"). The protagonists have [altruistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism "Altruism") values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas.

Many of the conflicts and political dimensions of *Star Trek* are [allegories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory "Allegory") of contemporary cultural realities. *The Original Series* addressed issues of the 1960s, just as later spin-offs have tackled issues of their respective decades.[^20] Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, [authoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism "Authoritarianism"), [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, [sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism "Sexism"), feminism, and the role of technology.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 57">: 57 </span></sup>  Roddenberry stated: "\[By creating\] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on *Star Trek*: we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 79">: 79 </span></sup>  If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the television network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing." [^22]

Roddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted *Star Trek* to show what humanity might develop into, if it would learn from the lessons of the past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species known as the [Vulcans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_\(Star_Trek\) "Vulcan (Star Trek)"), who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave *Star Trek* an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations.[^23] His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that *Enterprise* have a racially diverse crew.[^24]

In early 1964, Roddenberry presented a brief [treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_treatment "Film treatment") for a television series to [Desilu Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desilu_Productions "Desilu Productions"), calling it "a *[Wagon Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_Train "Wagon Train")* to the stars".[^25] Desilu studio head [Lucille Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball "Lucille Ball") was instrumental in approving production of the series.[^26] The studio worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay "Screenplay"), which was then pitched to NBC.[^27]

[NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC") paid to make a pilot, " [The Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cage_\(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series\) "The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)") ", starring [Jeffrey Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Hunter "Jeffrey Hunter") as *Enterprise* [Captain Christopher Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Pike_\(Star_Trek\) "Christopher Pike (Star Trek)"). NBC rejected "The Cage", but the executives were still impressed with the concept, and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: " [Where No Man Has Gone Before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_No_Man_Has_Gone_Before "Where No Man Has Gone Before") ".[^27]

While the show initially enjoyed high ratings, the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd out of 94 programs. Unhappy with the show's ratings, NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season.[^28] The show's [fan base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_base "Fan base"), led by [Bjo Trimble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjo_Trimble "Bjo Trimble"), conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, petitioning the network to keep the show on the air.[^28] [^29] NBC renewed the show, but moved it from primetime to the " [Friday night death slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot "Friday night death slot") ", and substantially reduced its budget.[^30] In protest, Roddenberry resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in *Star Trek*, which led to [Fred Freiberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Freiberger "Fred Freiberger") becoming producer for the show's third and final season.[^2] Despite another letter-writing campaign, NBC canceled the series after three seasons and 79 episodes.[^27]

After the original series was canceled, Desilu, which by then had been renamed [Paramount Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Television "Paramount Television"), licensed the [broadcast syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication "Broadcast syndication") rights to help recoup the production losses. Reruns began in late 1969, and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. This helped *Star Trek* develop a [cult following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following "Cult following") among [Trekkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie "Trekkie") greater than during its original run;[^31] by 1976, the cast described *Star Trek* as "the most popular series in the world".[^32]

One sign of the series' growing popularity was the first [*Star Trek* convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_convention "Science fiction convention"), which occurred on January 21–23, 1972 in New York City. Although the original expectation was that a few hundred fans would attend, several thousand turned up. Fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide.[^33]

The series' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise.[^34] [Filmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmation "Filmation") with [Paramount Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Television "Paramount Television") produced the first post–original series show, *[Star Trek: The Animated Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Animated_Series "Star Trek: The Animated Series")*, featuring the cast of the original series reprising their roles. It ran on NBC for 22 half-hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974.[^35]<sup><span title="Page / location: 208">: 208 </span></sup>  Although short-lived, typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period, the series garnered the franchise's only [Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award "Emmy Award") in a "Best Series" category—specifically [Outstanding Entertainment Children's Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Children%27s_Series "Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Series"); later Emmy awards for the franchise would be in technical categories. [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") and Roddenberry began developing a new series, *[Star Trek: Phase II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Phase_II "Star Trek: Phase II")*, in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity. Work on the series ended when the proposed [Paramount Television Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Television_Service "Paramount Television Service") folded.[^36]

Following the success of the science fiction movies *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_\(film\) "Star Wars (film)")* and *[Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind "Close Encounters of the Third Kind")*, Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of *Phase II* into the feature film *[Star Trek: The Motion Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture "Star Trek: The Motion Picture")*. The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.[^37]

The success of the sequel, *[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan")*, reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, *The Wrath of Khan* ' s lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six *Star Trek* feature films between 1979 and 1991, each featuring the *Original Series* cast in their original roles.[^38]

By 1983 Paramount saw *Star Trek* as a [media franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise "Media franchise") that it could use across mediums beyond television and film, such as books through its publisher [Simon & Schuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Schuster "Simon & Schuster"), and video games through its video game studio [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega "Sega").[^39] In 1987 it brought the franchise back to television with *[Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation "Star Trek: The Next Generation")*. Paramount chose to distribute the new series as a [first-run syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-run_syndication "First-run syndication") show rather than a network program.[^18] The series was set a century after the original, following the adventures of a new starship *Enterprise* with a new crew.[^40]

Following *Star Trek: The Motion Picture*, Roddenberry's role was changed from producer to creative consultant, with minimal input to the films, while being heavily involved with the creation of *[The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation "Star Trek: The Next Generation")*. Roddenberry died on October 24, 1991, giving executive producer [Rick Berman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Berman "Rick Berman") control of the franchise.[^21]<sup><span title="Page / location: 268">: 268 </span></sup>  [^18]<sup><span title="Page / location: 591–593">: 591–593 </span></sup>  *Star Trek* had become known to those within Paramount as "the franchise", because of its great success and recurring role as a [tent pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent-pole_programming "Tent-pole programming") for the studio when other projects failed.[^41] *The Next Generation* had the highest ratings of any *Star Trek* series and became the most syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run.[^42] In response to the *Next Generation* 's success, Paramount released a spin-off series, *[Deep Space Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine")*, in 1993. While never as popular as the *Next Generation*, the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons.

In January 1995, a few months after the *Next Generation* ended, Paramount released a fourth television series, *[Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager "Star Trek: Voyager")*. *Star Trek* production reached a peak in the mid-1990s with *Deep Space Nine* and *Voyager* airing concurrently and three of the four *Next Generation* -based feature films released in 1994, 1996, and 1998. By 1998, *Star Trek* was Paramount's most important property and the profits of "the franchise" funded a significant portion of the studio's operations.[^43] *Voyager* became the flagship show of the new [United Paramount Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPN "UPN") (UPN) and thus the first major network *Star Trek* series since the original.[^44]

After *Voyager* ended, UPN produced *[Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise "Star Trek: Enterprise")*, a prequel series. *Enterprise* did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the *Original Series*. Paramount renewed *Enterprise* for a fourth season, but moved it to the [Friday night death slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot "Friday night death slot").[^45] Like the *Original Series*, *Enterprise* ' s ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN canceled *Enterprise* at the end of its fourth season. *Enterprise* aired its final episode on May 13, 2005.[^46] A fan group, "Save *Enterprise* ", attempted to save the series and tried to raise $30 million to privately finance a fifth season of *Enterprise*.[^47] Though the effort garnered considerable press, the fan drive failed to save the series. The cancellation of *Enterprise* ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of *Star Trek* programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film *[Nemesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Nemesis "Star Trek: Nemesis")* cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of *Star Trek*.

In 2007, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise on the big screen. Writers [Roberto Orci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Orci "Roberto Orci") and [Alex Kurtzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kurtzman "Alex Kurtzman") and producer [J. J. Abrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams "J. J. Abrams") had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise. The team created the franchise's eleventh film, *[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_\(2009_film\) "Star Trek (2009 film)")*, releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. *Star Trek* was a prequel of the original series set in an [alternate timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history "Alternate history"), later named the [*Kelvin* Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Timeline "Kelvin Timeline"). This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline and minimized the impact these films would have on CBS's portion of the franchise. The eleventh *Star Trek* film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, stating in the film's advertisements that "this is not your father's *Star Trek* ".[^48]

The film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous *Star Trek* film.[^49] The plaudits include the franchise's first [Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award "Academy Award") (for [makeup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Makeup_and_Hairstyling "Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling")). Two sequels were released. The first sequel, *[Star Trek Into Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Into_Darkness "Star Trek Into Darkness")*, premiered in the spring of 2013.[^3] [^50] While the film did not earn as much in the North American box office as its predecessor, internationally, in terms of box office receipts, *Into Darkness* is the most successful of the franchise.[^51] The thirteenth film, *[Star Trek Beyond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Beyond "Star Trek Beyond")*, was released on July 22, 2016.[^52] The film had many pre-production problems and its script went through several rewrites. While receiving positive reviews, *Star Trek Beyond* disappointed in the box office.[^53]

[CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") turned down several proposals in the mid-2000s to restart the franchise on the small screen. Proposals included pitches from film director [Bryan Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Singer "Bryan Singer"), *[Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5 "Babylon 5")* creator [J. Michael Straczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski "J. Michael Straczynski"), and *Trek* actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner.[^54] [^55] [^56] While CBS was not creating new *Star Trek* for network television, the ease of access to *Star Trek* content on new streaming services such as [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") and [Amazon Prime Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video "Amazon Prime Video") introduced a new set of fans to the franchise. CBS eventually sought to capitalize on this trend, and brought the franchise back to the small screen with the series *[Star Trek: Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery "Star Trek: Discovery")* to help launch and draw subscribers to its streaming service [CBS All Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_All_Access "CBS All Access").[^57] *Discovery's* [first season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery_\(season_1\) "Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)") premiered on September 24, 2017.[^58] While the first three seasons of the show are shown in the United States exclusively on the service, which changed its name to [Paramount+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B "Paramount+"), Netflix, in exchange for funding the production costs of the show, owned the international screening rights for the show.[^59] This Netflix distribution and production deal ended right before the fourth season premiere of *Discovery* in November 2021.[^60] *Discovery* has since been exclusive to Paramount Global owned platforms.

In June 2018, after becoming sole showrunner of *Discovery*, Kurtzman signed a five-year overall deal with CBS Television Studios to expand the *Star Trek* franchise beyond *Discovery* to several new series, miniseries, and animated series.[^61] Kurtzman wanted to "open this world up" and create multiple series set in the same universe but with their own "unique storytelling and distinct cinematic feel",[^62] an approach that he compared to the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe "Marvel Cinematic Universe").[^63] However, the franchise would not tell a single story across multiple series, allowing audiences to watch each series without having to see all of the others.[^64] CBS and Kurtzman refer to this expanded franchise as the ***Star Trek* Universe**.[^65]

The second series of the expansion of the *Star Trek* Universe, *[Star Trek: Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard "Star Trek: Picard")*, features [Patrick Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Stewart "Patrick Stewart") reprising the character [Jean-Luc Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard "Jean-Luc Picard") from *The Next Generation*. *Picard* premiered on CBS All Access on January 23, 2020. Unlike *Discovery*, Amazon Prime Video streams *Picard* internationally.[^66] CBS has also released two seasons of *[Star Trek: Short Treks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Short_Treks "Star Trek: Short Treks")*, a series of standalone mini-episodes which air between *Discovery* and *Picard* seasons. A new live-action series, *[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Strange_New_Worlds "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds")*, a spinoff of the second season of *Discovery* and prequel to the original series, premiered on May 5, 2022. *[Lower Decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Lower_Decks "Star Trek: Lower Decks")*, an animated adult [comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy "Comedy") series, was released on August 6, 2020, on CBS All Access. Another animated series, *[Star Trek: Prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Prodigy "Star Trek: Prodigy")*, premiered on the rebranded service [Paramount+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B "Paramount+") first on October 28, 2021, and on December 17, 2021, on [Nickelodeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon "Nickelodeon").[^67] *Prodigy* is the first *Star Trek* series to specifically target younger audiences, and is the franchise's first fully computer animated series. Star Trek's television presence would reach a new peak in 2022, with five *Star Trek* series airing simultaneously that year.[^4]

The *Star Trek: Picard* series finale aired in April 2023.[^68] Discovery's series finale aired in May 2024.[^69] A *[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet_Academy_\(2024_TV_series\) "Starfleet Academy (2024 TV series)")* series is in pre-production to take the place of one of these series.[^70] *Star Trek: Prodigy* was removed from Paramount+ in June 2023.[^71] The series was picked up by Netflix, and season 1 was made available on December 25, 2023. A second season aired later in 2024.[^72]

Paramount is also planning to create television films for Paramount+ every two years.[^73] The first of these movies, *[Section 31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Section_31 "Star Trek: Section 31")*, stars [Michelle Yeoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Yeoh "Michelle Yeoh"), reprising her role as [Empress Georgiou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Georgiou "Philippa Georgiou") from *Discovery*,[^74] and was given a release date of January 24, 2025.[^75]

## Films

Paramount Pictures has produced thirteen *Star Trek* feature films. The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of the *Original Series*; the seventh film, *Generations*, was intended as a transition from original cast to the cast of the *Next Generation*; the next three films focused completely on the *Next Generation* cast.[^6] The eleventh film was widely considered to be a [reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_\(fiction\) "Reboot (fiction)") of the franchise, despite being a continuation set in an [alternate timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_timeline "Alternate timeline") known as the "Kelvin Timeline". Additionally, streaming service Paramount+ intends to release a television film every two years starting with *Section 31*.

In May 2022, Alex Kurtzman said there were discussions about expanding the *Star Trek* Universe to dramatic podcasts.[^79] The next month, [Nicholas Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Meyer "Nicholas Meyer") said he was negotiating a deal to make a podcast based on a television series he had planned about [Khan Noonien Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh "Khan Noonien Singh") before the events of *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan*.[^80] The project was confirmed in February 2025 as an [audio drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_drama "Audio drama") series titled *Star Trek: Khan*.[^81]

## Cultural impact

The *Star Trek* media franchise is a multibillion-dollar industry, owned by Paramount Global.[^93] Gene Roddenberry sold *Star Trek* to [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC") as a classic adventure drama; he pitched the show as " *Wagon Train* to the Stars" and as *[Horatio Hornblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Hornblower "Horatio Hornblower") in Space*.[^94] The opening line, "to boldly go where no man has gone before", was taken almost verbatim from a U.S. [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") booklet on space produced after the [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik "Sputnik") flight in 1957.[^95]

*Star Trek* and its spin-offs have proven highly popular in syndication and was broadcast worldwide.[^96] The show's cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability. *Star Trek* [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_convention "Science fiction convention") have become popular among its fans, who call themselves " [trekkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie "Trekkie") " or "trekkers".[^97] An entire subculture has grown up around the franchise, which was documented in the film *[Trekkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkies_\(film\) "Trekkies (film)")*. *Star Trek* was ranked most popular cult show by *[TV Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide "TV Guide")*.[^98] The franchise has also garnered [many comparisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Star_Trek_and_Star_Wars "Comparison of Star Trek and Star Wars") of the *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars")* franchise being rivals in the science fiction genre with many fans and scholars.[^99] [^100] [^101]

The *Star Trek* franchise inspired some designers of technologies, the [Palm PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_OS "Palm OS") and the handheld mobile phone.[^102] [^103] Michael Jones, Chief technologist of [Google Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth "Google Earth"), has cited the [tricorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder "Tricorder") 's mapping capability as one inspiration in the development of Keyhole/Google Earth.[^104] The [Tricorder X Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder_X_Prize "Tricorder X Prize"), a contest to build a medical tricorder device was announced in 2012. Ten finalists were selected in 2014, and the winner was to be selected in January 2016. However, no team managed to reach the required criteria. *Star Trek* also brought [teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation "Teleportation") to popular attention with its depiction of "matter-energy transport", with the famously misquoted phrase " [Beam me up, Scotty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_me_up,_Scotty "Beam me up, Scotty") " entering the vernacular.[^105] The *Star Trek* replicator is credited in the scientific literature with inspiring the field of [diatom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom") [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology").[^106] In 1976, following a letter-writing campaign, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") named its prototype [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program") [*Enterprise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise "Space Shuttle Enterprise"), after the [fictional starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\(NCC-1701\) "USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)").[^107] Later, the introductory sequence to *Star Trek: Enterprise* included footage of this shuttle which, along with images of a naval sailing vessel called *[Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Enterprise_\(1705\) "HMS Enterprise (1705)")*, depicted the advancement of human transportation technology.

Beyond *Star Trek* 's fictional innovations, its contributions to television history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While more common in subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an *Enterprise* crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, and a black female communications officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode " [Plato's Stepchildren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_Stepchildren "Plato's Stepchildren") ", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses (*e.g.* on *[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smothers_Brothers_Comedy_Hour "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour")* [^108]) predated this one. Nichelle Nichols, who played the communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry of her plan to leave the series, she was told a big fan wanted to meet her while attending an [NAACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP "NAACP") dinner party:

> I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.") walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that *Star Trek* was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. \[She told King about her plans to leave the series.\] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.'
> 
> —  [Nichelle Nichols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols "Nichelle Nichols"), *[Detroit Free Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press "Detroit Free Press")* (2016) [^109]

After the show, Nichols used this public standing to speak for women and [people of color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_color "People of color") and against their exclusion from the US human space program; NASA reacted by asking her to find people for its future Space Shuttle program. Nichols proceeded and successfully brought the first non-white people and [women into the US space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space "Women in space"), working in this quality for NASA from the late 1970s until the late 1980s.[^110] [^111]

In 2020, the US effort to develop a vaccine to protect against [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") was named [Operation Warp Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed "Operation Warp Speed"), which was suggested by a *Star Trek* fan, Peter Marks. Marks leads the unit at the [Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration "Food and Drug Administration") which approves vaccines and therapies.[^112]

### Parodies

Early parodies of *Star Trek* included a famous sketch on *[Saturday Night Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live "Saturday Night Live")* titled " [The Last Voyage of the Starship *Enterprise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Voyage_of_the_Starship_Enterprise "The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise") ", with [John Belushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Belushi "John Belushi") as Kirk, [Chevy Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase "Chevy Chase") as Spock and [Dan Aykroyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Aykroyd "Dan Aykroyd") as McCoy.[^113] In the 1980s, *Saturday Night Live* did a sketch with William Shatner reprising his Captain Kirk role in *The Restaurant Enterprise*, preceded by a sketch in which he played himself at a *Trek* convention angrily telling fans to "Get a Life", a phrase that has become part of *Trek* folklore.[^114] *[In Living Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Living_Color "In Living Color")* continued the tradition in a sketch where Captain Kirk is played by fellow Canadian [Jim Carrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey "Jim Carrey").[^115]

A feature-length film that indirectly parodies *Star Trek* is *[Galaxy Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Quest "Galaxy Quest")*. This film is based on the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based television series called *Galaxy Quest*, modeled heavily on *Star Trek*, believe that what they are seeing is real.[^116] Many *Star Trek* actors have been quoted saying that *Galaxy Quest* was a brilliant parody.[^117] [^118]

*Star Trek* has been blended with [Gilbert and Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan "Gilbert and Sullivan") at least twice. [The North Toronto Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Toronto_Players "North Toronto Players") presented a *Star Trek* adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan titled *H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation* in 1991 and an adaptation by [Jon Mullich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Mullich "Jon Mullich") of Gilbert and Sullivan's *[H.M.S. Pinafore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore "H.M.S. Pinafore")* that sets the operetta in the world of *Star Trek* has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold.[^119] A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and *Star Trek* was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was titled *Star Drek: The Generation After That*. It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies.[^120]

*[The Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons "The Simpsons")* and *[Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama "Futurama")* television series and others have had many individual episodes parodying *Star Trek* or with *Trek* allusions.[^121] *[Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror "Black Mirror") 's* *Star Trek* parody episode, " [USS Callister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Callister "USS Callister") ", won four [Emmy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award "Emmy Award"), including the [Outstanding Television Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Television_Movie "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie") and [Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or Drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Writing_for_a_Limited_Series,_Movie,_or_Dramatic_Special "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"), and was nominated for three more.[^122] A sequel, " [USS Callister: Into Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Callister:_Into_Infinity "USS Callister: Into Infinity") " was released on 2025.[^123]

In August 2010, the members of the [Internal Revenue Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service "Internal Revenue Service") created a *Star Trek* themed training video for a conference. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds in a congressional investigation.[^124] [^125]

*Star Trek* has been parodied in several non-English movies, including the German *[Traumschiff Surprise – Periode 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumschiff_Surprise_%E2%80%93_Periode_1 "Traumschiff Surprise – Periode 1")* which features a gay version of the *Original Series* bridge crew and a Turkish film that spoofs that same series' episode " [The Man Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Trap "The Man Trap") " in one of the series of films based on the character [Turist Ömer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turist_%C3%96mer "Turist Ömer").

### Fan productions

Until 2016, Paramount Pictures and CBS permitted fan-produced films and episode-like clips to be produced. Several veteran *Star Trek* actors and writers participated in many of these productions. Several producers turned to [crowdfunding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding "Crowdfunding"), such as [Kickstarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter "Kickstarter"), to help with production and other costs.[^128]

Popular productions include: [*New Voyages*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_New_Voyages "Star Trek: New Voyages") (2004–2016) and *[Star Trek Continues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Continues "Star Trek Continues")* (2013–2017). Additional productions include: [*Of Gods and Men*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Of_Gods_and_Men "Star Trek: Of Gods and Men") (2008), originally released as a three-part web series, and *[Prelude to Axanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Axanar "Prelude to Axanar")*. Audio dramatizations such as *The Continuing Mission* (2007–2016) have also been published by fans.

In 2016, CBS published guidelines which restricted the scope of fan productions, such as limiting the length of episodes or films to fifteen minutes, limiting production budgets to $50,000, and preventing actors and technicians from previous *Star Trek* productions from participating.[^129] A number of highly publicized productions have since been canceled or have gone abeyant.[^130]

Of the various science fiction awards for drama, only the [Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation "Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation") dates back as far as the original series.[^7] In 1968, all five nominees for a Hugo Award were individual episodes of *Star Trek*, as were three of the five nominees in 1967, one of which won.[^8] [^35]<sup><span title="Page / location: 231">: 231 </span></sup>  *The Next Generation* won Hugo awards in 1993 and 1995. Nominations have also been received by *Deep Space Nine*, *Enterprise*, *Discovery*, and *Lower Decks*, as well as several of the *Star Trek* feature films and, in 2008, an episode of the [fan-made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_film "Fan film") series *[Star Trek: Phase II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_New_Voyages "Star Trek: New Voyages")*.

One of the most successful films was *Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home*, which grossed a global total of $133 million against a $21 million budget.[^9] [^161] *The Voyage Home* garnered 11 nominations at the 14th annual [Saturn Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award "Saturn Award"), tying *[Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_\(film\) "Aliens (film)")* for number of nominations. Nimoy and Shatner were nominated for best actor for their roles,[^162] and Catherine Hicks was nominated for best supporting actress. At the [59th Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/59th_Academy_Awards "59th Academy Awards"), *The Voyage Home* was nominated for Best Cinematography, Sound ([Terry Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Porter_\(sound_engineer\) "Terry Porter (sound engineer)"), [David J.

Hudson"), [Mel Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Metcalfe "Mel Metcalfe") and [Gene Cantamessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Cantamessa "Gene Cantamessa")), Sound Effects Editing, and Original Score.[^163]

In 2024, the entire *Star Trek* franchise was awarded the Peabody Institutional Award for its enduring body of work and lasting impact on media and society at large.[^166]

## Corporate ownership

*Star Trek* began as a joint-production of [Norway Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_Productions "Norway Productions"), owned by Roddenberry, and [Desilu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desilu_Productions "Desilu Productions"), owned by [Desi Arnaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi_Arnaz "Desi Arnaz") and [Lucille Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball "Lucille Ball"). The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu (later [Paramount Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Television_\(original\) "Paramount Television (original)")), William Shatner's production company, and the broadcast network, [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC"). However, *Star Trek* lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount. With NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 (equivalent to $1,214,524 in 2024) offered by the studio.[^27] Paramount would go on to license the series to television syndicators worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount and Roddenberry sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become *[The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation "Star Trek: The Next Generation")*.

As for Desilu, the studio was acquired by [Gulf+Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_and_Western_Industries "Gulf and Western Industries"). It was then reorganized as the [television production division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Television_\(original\) "Paramount Television (original)") of [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures"), which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications. Sometime before 1986, [Sumner Redstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner_Redstone "Sumner Redstone") had acquired a controlling stake of [Viacom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_\(1952%E2%80%932006\) "Viacom (1952–2006)") via his family's theater chain, [National Amusements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Amusements "National Amusements"). Viacom was established in 1952 as a division of [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") responsible for syndicating the network's in-house productions, originally called [CBS Films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Films "CBS Films"). In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications were merged.[^27] Viacom then merged with its former parent, [CBS Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation "Westinghouse Electric Corporation"), in 1999. National Amusements and the Redstone family increased their stake in the combined company between 1999 and 2005.

In 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [Viacom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_\(2005%E2%80%932019\) "Viacom (2005–2019)"), and the new [CBS Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Corporation "CBS Corporation"). National Amusements and the Redstone family retained approximately 80% ownership of both CBS and Viacom.[^167] *Star Trek* was split between the two entities. The terms of this split were not known. However, CBS held all copyrights, marks, production assets, and film negatives, to all *Star Trek* television series. CBS also retained the rights to all likenesses, characters, names and settings, and stories, and the right to license *Star Trek*, and its spin-offs, to merchandisers, and publishers, etc.[^168] The rights were exercised via the new [CBS Television Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Television_Studios "CBS Television Studios"), which was carved out of the former [Paramount Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Television_\(original\) "Paramount Television (original)").

[Viacom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_\(2005%E2%80%93present\) "Viacom (2005–present)"), which housed [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures"), retained the feature film library, and exclusive rights to produce new feature films for a limited time. Viacom also retained home video distribution rights for all television series produced before 2005.[^27] [^169] However, home video editions of the various television series released after the split, as well as streaming video versions of episodes available worldwide, carried variants of the new CBS Television Studios livery in addition to the original Paramount Television Studios livery. It was unclear who retained the [synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_rights "Synchronization rights") or [streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media") rights.

Rights and distribution issues, and the fraught relationship between the leadership at CBS, Viacom, and the National Amusements' board of directors, resulted in a number of delayed and canceled *Star Trek* productions between 2005 and 2019.[^170] Additionally, the development and release of the new *[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_\(2009_film\) "Star Trek (2009 film)")* film, in 2009, was met with resistance by executives at CBS, as was *[Into Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Into_Darkness "Star Trek Into Darkness")* (2013) and *[Beyond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Beyond "Star Trek Beyond")* (2016), which affected merchandising, tie-in media, and promotion for the new films.[^171] During this period, both CBS and Viacom continued to list *Star Trek* as an important asset in their prospectus to investors, and in corporate filings made to the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission").

On August 13, 2019, CBS and Viacom boards of directors reached an agreement to [reunite the conglomerates as a single entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_merger_of_CBS_and_Viacom "2019 merger of CBS and Viacom") called ViacomCBS.[^172] National Amusements' board of directors approved the merger on October 28, 2019, which was finalized on December 4, bringing the *Star Trek* franchise back under one roof.[^173] [^174] [^175] ViacomCBS was renamed [Paramount Global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global "Paramount Global") on February 16, 2022.[^176]

On July 7, 2024, Paramount Global's board approved a deal to merge with [Skydance Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skydance_Media "Skydance Media"), the resulting company was being referred to at that time as "New Paramount".[^177] [^178] As of April 2025, the deal is awaiting FCC approval and facing a series of lawsuits.[^179]

[^1]: Published as *Star Trek Monthly* from 1995 until 2003

[^2]: Roddenberry co-authored two scripts for the third season.

[^3]: Star Trek Into Darkness premiered in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2013, but the film did not release in the United States until May 17, 2013

[^4]: While 2022 had the most Star Trek series, each series had fewer episodes per season than when TNG, DS9 and Voyager where airing together.

[^5]: The episode count includes all completed and released episodes. The count also includes the *Original Series* 's unaired pilot, "The Cage". Multi-part episodes not originally broadcast as one presentation are counted individually. Ten feature-length episodes are counted as two episodes each, as they were split for foreign broadcast and syndication.

[^6]: Film titles of the North American and UK releases of the films no longer contained the number of the film following the sixth film (the sixth was *Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country* but the seventh was *Star Trek Generations*). However, European releases continued using numbers in the film titles until *Nemesis*.

[^7]: Although the [Hugo Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award "Hugo Award") is mainly given for print-media science fiction, its "best drama" award is usually given to film or television presentations. The Hugo does not give out awards for best actor, director, or other aspects of film production. Before 2002, films and television series competed for the same Hugo, before the split of the drama award into short drama and long drama.

[^8]: Other nominees for the 1967 [Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation "Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation") were *[Fahrenheit 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451_\(1966_film\) "Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)")* and *[Fantastic Voyage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage "Fantastic Voyage")*.

Ten years after "Star Trek" was cancelled, almost to the day, I was invited to join the board of directors of the newly formed National Space Society. They flew me to Washington and I gave a speech called "New Opportunities for the Humanization of Space" or "Space, What's in it for me?" In \[the speech\], I'm going where no man or woman dares go. I took NASA on for not including women and I gave some history of the powerful women who had applied and, after five times applying, felt disenfranchised and backed off. \[At that time\] NASA was having their fifth or sixth recruitment and women and ethnic people \[were\] staying away in droves. I was asked to come to headquarters the next day and they wanted me to assist them in persuading women and people of ethnic backgrounds that NASA was serious \[about recruiting them\]. And I said you've got to be joking; I didn't take them seriously.... John Yardley, who I knew from working on a previous project, was in the room and said 'Nichelle, we are serious.' I said OK. I will do this and I will bring you the most qualified people on the planet, as qualified as anyone you've ever had and I will bring them in droves. And if you do not pick a person of color, if you do not pick a woman, if it's the same old, same old, all-white male astronaut corps, that you've done for the last five years, and I'm just another dupe, I will be your worst nightmare.
