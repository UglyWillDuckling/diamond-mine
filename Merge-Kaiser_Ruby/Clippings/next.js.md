## Security

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Next.js, we encourage you to ***responsibly disclose this and NOT open a public issue***. We will investigate all legitimate reports.

Our preference is that you make use of GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to disclose potential security vulnerabilities in our Open Source Software. To do this, please visit [https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security) and click the "Report a vulnerability" button.
