### Tags

Tags give a way of forming abstract hierarchies, especially when the system, like Obsidian, supports hierarchies within tags themselves, e.g. #call/work/me/very/deep/note [^1]

Using multiple tags is even better as the tag can then exist in multiple hierarchies at once.
For example, a note can be both a #tool and a #program.
### Saved Searches

Really useful for finding notes quickly without having to remember **each** tag or folder path.

The searches are available globally which makes them super easy to access unlike dataview queries which are scoped to a single note.
