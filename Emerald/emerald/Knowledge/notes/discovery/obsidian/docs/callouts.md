Callouts

Use callouts to include additional content without breaking the flow of your notes.

To create a callout, add `[!info]` to the first line of a blockquote, where `info` is the _type identifier_. The type identifier determines how the callout looks and feels. To see all available types, refer to [Supported types](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Supported types).

```markdown
> [!info]
> Here's a callout block.
> It supports **Markdown**, [[Internal link|Wikilinks]], and [[Embed files|embeds]]!
> ![[Engelbart.jpg]]
```

Here's a `callout` block.
It supports **Markdown**, [Wikilinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) and [embeds](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embed+files)!

Callouts are also supported natively on [Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Introduction+to+Obsidian+Publish).

Note

If you're also using the Admonitions plugin, you should update it to at least version 8.0.0 to avoid problems with the new callout feature.

### Change the title

By default, the title of the callout is its type identifier in title case. You can change it by adding text after the type identifier:

```markdown
> [!tip] Callouts can have custom titles
> Like this one.
```

You can even omit the body to create title-only callouts:

```markdown
> [!tip] Title-only callout
```

### Foldable callouts

You can make a callout foldable by adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) directly after the type identifier.

> [!faq]+ Are callout foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hiddeen when the callout is collapsed.

### Nested callouts
> You can `nest` callouts in **multiple** levels.

```markdown
> [!question] Can callouts be nested?
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> > > [!example]  You can even use multiple layers of nesting.
```
