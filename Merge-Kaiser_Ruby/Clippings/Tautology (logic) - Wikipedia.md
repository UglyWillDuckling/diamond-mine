In [mathematical logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), a **tautology** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): ταυτολογία) is a [formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") that is true regardless of the interpretation of its component [terms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_\(logic\) "Term (logic)"), with only the [logical constants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_constant "Logical constant") having a fixed meaning. For example, a formula that states, "the ball is green or the ball is not green," is always true, regardless of what a ball is and regardless of its colour. Tautology is usually, though not always, used to refer to valid formulas of [propositional logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic").

The philosopher [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein "Ludwig Wittgenstein") first applied the term to redundancies of [propositional logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") in 1921, borrowing from [rhetoric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric"), where a [tautology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_\(rhetoric\) "Tautology (rhetoric)") is a repetitive statement. In logic, a formula is [satisfiable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_and_validity "Satisfiability and validity") if it is true under at least one interpretation, and thus a tautology is a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable. In other words, it cannot be false.

Unsatisfiable statements, both through negation and affirmation, are known formally as [contradictions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction "Contradiction"). A formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is said to be [logically contingent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_\(philosophy\) "Contingency (philosophy)"). Such a formula can be made either true or false based on the values assigned to its propositional variables.

The [double turnstile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_turnstile "Double turnstile") notation ${\displaystyle \vDash S}$ is used to indicate that *S* is a tautology. Tautology is sometimes symbolized by "V*pq*", and contradiction by "O*pq*". The [tee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_\(symbol\) "Tee (symbol)") symbol ${\displaystyle \top }$ is sometimes used to denote an arbitrary tautology, with the dual symbol ${\displaystyle \bot }$ ([falsum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsum "Falsum")) representing an arbitrary contradiction; in any symbolism, a tautology may be substituted for the truth value "[true](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth")", as symbolized, for instance, by "1".[^1]

Tautologies are a key concept in [propositional logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic"), where a tautology is defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible [Boolean valuation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_valuation "Boolean valuation") of its [propositional variables](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_variable "Propositional variable").[^:0-2] A key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that an [effective method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method "Effective method") exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied (equiv., whether its negation is unsatisfiable).

The definition of tautology can be extended to sentences in [predicate logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic "Predicate logic"), which may contain [quantifiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_\(logic\) "Quantification (logic)")—a feature absent from sentences of propositional logic. Indeed, in propositional logic, there is no distinction between a tautology and a [logically valid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") formula. In the context of predicate logic, many authors define a tautology to be a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic, and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable). The set of such formulas is a [proper subset](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_subset "Proper subset") of the set of logically valid sentences of predicate logic (i.e., sentences that are true in every [model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_\(mathematical_logic\) "Structure (mathematical logic)")).
