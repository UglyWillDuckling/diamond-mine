  In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), workload identity federation allows
  workloads running in external systems (like on-premises or other clouds) to
  use their own identities to access resources in GCP. Here's how it works:

  1. A workload in an external system requests a short-lived token from a
  **trusted identity provider** (IdP). The **IdP** could be a system like Google
  Workspace, **Okta**, or Azure AD.
  2. The workload sends this token to the GCP metadata server, which verifies
  the token with the **IdP**.
  3. If the token is valid, the metadata server generates ==a new GCP token== that
  the workload can use to access GCP resources.
  4. The workload uses the GCP token to authenticate itself to GCP APIs or
  services.

  This process allows the workload to use its own identity to access GCP
  resources, without the need for managing individual service account keys. It
  also provides a secure and flexible way to manage access control for
  external workloads, and it helps to ensure that only authorized workloads
  can access GCP resources.

  Workload identity federation on GCP uses open standards like OpenID Connect
  (OIDC) and JSON Web Token (JWT) to enable interoperability with various
  identity providers and external systems. This makes it easy to integrate
  with existing systems and workflows.
