 “Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.” (Dune)

“What do such machines really do? They increase the number of things we can do without thinking. Things we do without thinking-there’s the real danger.” (God Emperor of Dune)
