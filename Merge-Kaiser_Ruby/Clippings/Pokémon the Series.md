It is divided into series and storyline arcs, which are then dubbed into [seasons](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_the_Series_series_and_seasons "List of Pokémon the Series series and seasons"), which are divided and aired according to the [English opening](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_the_Series_opening_and_ending_songs "List of Pokémon the Series opening and ending songs") of each episode (with the exception of Seasons [1](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Season_1 "Season 1") through [6](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Season_6 "Season 6"), which were divided and aired by 52 episode segments).

## Trivia

### Dub differences

- All of the Japanese opening and ending themes are replaced with all-new ones made for an international audience. International dubs based on the English dub generally translate and dub these openings. The footage for the English dub openings is generally taken from the Japanese themes. Also, the vast majority of English ending themes are replays or instrumental versions of the opening theme.
- The dub occasionally [skips episodes](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_banned_and_skipped_episodes "List of banned and skipped episodes") deemed inappropriate for an international audience. These episodes then get skipped in the vast majority of countries that produce dubs translated from the English dub. They are still shown in Asian countries such as South Korea, China, Vietnam, and Thailand that produce dubs translated from the original Japanese version.
- The placing of cold openings in the dub is different from the original Japanese version. For example, during series that placed the opening theme first, followed by the first part of the episode and then the title card, for example, during *Gold & Silver*, in the English dub, the first part of the episode played first as the "cold opening", and then the opening theme, and then the title card.
	- Nowadays, the cold opening comes first, followed by the opening theme and then the title card in both the Japanese version and dub.
- Background music is typically removed or replaced in the dub.
- The eyecatches are replaced. For example, the original has a segment called *Dare da?* (Who is it?) that is replaced by "Who's That Pokémon?". All pre-episode and post-episode segments like the Professor Oak ones and the Poké Problem from *Sun & Moon* are removed completely.
	- In Asia, a few countries use the original Japanese version as the base of their own dub (for example, the Korean and Mandarin Chinese dubs) and therefore retain these segments.
- The English dub removes the [next episode previews](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Next_Episode_Preview "Next Episode Preview") from every episode, cutting off every episode at the credits. Most dubs around the world translate and dub the English version of the series and therefore do not feature them either.
	- In Asia, a few countries use the original Japanese version as the base of their own dub (for example, the Korean and Mandarin Chinese dubs) and therefore retain the previews and dub them.
