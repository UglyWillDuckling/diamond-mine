This is a list of the world's countries and their [dependencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory "Dependent territory"), ranked by total area, including land and water.

[Dymaxion map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map "Dymaxion map") of the world with the 30 largest countries and territories by area

This list includes entries that are not limited to those in the [ISO 3166-1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1 "ISO 3166-1") standard, which covers [sovereign states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state") and [dependent territories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory "Dependent territory"). All 193 [member states of the United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations") plus the two observer states are given a rank number. [Largely unrecognised states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition "List of states with limited recognition") not in ISO 3166-1 are included in the list in ranked order. The areas of such largely unrecognised [states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_\(polity\) "State (polity)") are in most cases also included in the areas of the more widely recognised states that claim the same territory; see the notes in the "Notes" column for each country for clarification.

Not included in the list are [individual country claims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_claims_in_Antarctica "Territorial claims in Antarctica") to parts of the continent of [Antarctica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") or entities such as the [European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union")[^2] that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign countries or dependent territories.

This list includes three measurements of area:

- **Total area:** the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines.
- **Land area:** the aggregate of all land within international boundaries and coastlines, excluding water area.
- **Water area:** the sum of the surface areas of all inland water bodies (lakes, [reservoirs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir "Reservoir"), and rivers) within international boundaries and coastlines.[^3] Coastal [internal waters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_waters "Internal waters") may be included. [Territorial seas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters#Territorial_sea "Territorial waters") are not included unless otherwise noted. Contiguous zones and [exclusive economic zones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone "Exclusive economic zone") are not included.

Total area is taken from the [United Nations Statistics Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Statistics_Division "United Nations Statistics Division") unless otherwise noted.[^4] Land and water are taken from the [Food and Agriculture Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization "Food and Agriculture Organization") unless otherwise noted.[^5] The [CIA *World Factbook*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook "CIA World Factbook") is most often used when different UN departments disagree.[^ciastats-1] Other sources and details for each entry may be specified in the relevant footnote.
