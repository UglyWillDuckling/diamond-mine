# **A new approach to advice columns**

**Wednesday, February 26, 2025 at 7:30:06 PM**

### Welcome to another Vox Explainer

Hi Members,

Last year, Future Perfect, Vox's section devoted to finding the best ways to do good in the world, tried something different: We launched **Your Mileage May Vary**, a nontraditional advice column by senior reporter Sigal Samuel.

### Q&A with Marina Bolotnikova and Sigal Samuel

**Marina:** Editing your column every two weeks, I'm awed by the depth of your philosophical and religious knowledge. Where did you get that background? How much of it is already in your brain, and how much is new research unique to each column?

**Sigal:** I did my undergraduate degree in philosophy and Western religions, so that definitely helps! But to be honest, my entire life has basically been a degree program in philosophy and Western religions. I grew up in Orthodox Judaism. My dad was a professor of comparative mysticism (Jewish and Islamic), and the kind of parent who gives his daughter a book on Presocratic philosophers for her 16th birthday. And before joining Vox, I was a religion reporter.

### More Q&A

**Marina:** What made you want to combine your philosophical background with practical advice? Do you have experience giving advice in real life?

**Sigal:** Part of me has always felt really drawn to service — to helping people with the intellectual and spiritual problems they wrestle with. In fact, when I was younger, I had a secret dream of becoming a rabbi. I ended up becoming a writer, but I think that actually lets me do pretty similar work!

**Marina:** Many of your reader questions, naturally, deal with problems that are unique to modern life, like your columns about whether or not to have kids or on whether to raise kids with religion. What do you think ancient philosophy (or even hundred-year-old philosophy) has to offer people today?

**Sigal:** As postmoderns, we like to think we're so special. We imagine we're really different from ancient people. But they grappled with almost all the same questions as us!

### More Q&A

**Marina:** What makes a great reader question for your column?

**Sigal:** The ideal question touches on a theme that's likely to resonate with others, but also comes with enough concrete detail that I can get a real sense of your struggle.

**Marina:** How do you drill down into a reader's specific question while also making the answer interesting to a large audience?

**Sigal:** In addition to choosing questions that I know will resonate with other people, I make sure to include in every column at least one little-known but fantastic philosophical nugget.

### Philosophical Reading Recommendations

**Marina:** What are your top three philosophical reading recommendations for people looking for frameworks for living a better life?

**Sigal:** I'm going to recommend three short-and-sweet things that have influenced me a lot.

1. This conversation I had with neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland.
2. The contemporary philosopher Susan Wolf's essay, "Moral Saints," which argues that you shouldn't actually strive to be "a person whose every action is as morally good as possible … who is as morally worthy as can be."
3. This Aeon essay introduced me to Bernard Williams's idea of "moral luck." Trust me, it's worth the read: The concept of moral luck will blow your mind.
