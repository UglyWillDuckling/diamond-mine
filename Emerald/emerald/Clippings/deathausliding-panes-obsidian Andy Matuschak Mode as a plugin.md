## Sliding Panes (Andy Matuschak Mode) Obsidian Plugin

Sliding Panes (Andy Matuschak Mode) as a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

[![Screenshot](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian/raw/master/screenshot.gif)](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian/raw/master/screenshot.gif)

This plugin changes the way panes in the main workspace are handled â€” inspired by the UI of [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/).  
Instead of shrinking the workspace to fit panels, the panels will remain a fixed width (but resizable) and stack so you can scroll between them. Note headers are rotated and added to the left of the pane like a spine (optional), and will stack up as you scroll (also optional), allowing easy navigation between them.

(Note: To open links in a new pane in Obsidian, ctrl/cmd click them)

### Other Features

- Note headers stack up on the right *as well as* the left.
- Changing an active pane scrolls that pane into view.
- Togglable without having to copy CSS into your theme.
- Togglable features, such as the rotated headers and stacking

### Settings

- **Toggle Sliding Panes** - Turns sliding panes on or off globally *(also available via command/hotkey)*
- **Leaf Auto Width** - If on, the width of the pane should fill the available space *(also available via command/hotkey)*
- **Leaf Width** - The default width of a single pane
- **Toggle rotated headers** - Rotates headers to use as spines *(also available via command/hotkey)*
- **Swap rotated header direction** - Swaps the direction of rotated headers *(also available via command/hotkey)*
- **Toggle stacking** - Panes will stack up to the left and right *(also available via command/hotkey)*
- **Spine Width** - The width of the rotated header (or gap) for stacking

### Compatibility

Custom plugins are only available for Obsidian v0.9.7+.

The current API of this repo targets Obsidian **v0.10.9**.

### Notes

This is all very expermental at the moment, so parts might not work, etc.

It still gets a bit slow if you're loading a lot of documents, so try not to load too many at once.

## Installation

### From within Obsidian

From Obsidian v0.9.8, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

- Open Settings > Third-party plugin
- Make sure Safe mode is **off**
- Click Browse community plugins
- Search for this plugin
- Click Install
- Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin

#### Updates

You can follow the same procedure to update the plugin

### From GitHub

- Download the Latest Release from the Releases section of the GitHub Repository
- Extract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`  
Note: On some machines the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
- Reload Obsidian
- If prompted about Safe Mode, you can disable safe mode and enable the plugin. Otherwise head to Settings, third-party plugins, make sure safe mode is off and enable the plugin from there.

## Development

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.  
The repo depends on the latest [plugin API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

If you want to contribute to development and/or just customize it with your own tweaks, you can do the following:

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile.
- Copy `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `styles.css` to a subfolder of your plugins folder (e.g, `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-name>/`)
- Reload obsidian to see changes

Alternately, you can clone the repo directly into your plugins folder and once dependencies are installed use `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.  
You may have to reload obsidian (`ctrl+R`) to see changes.

## Version History

## 3.2.2

- Fixed closing notes activating the leftmost note

- Added the note title to the icon, so if your panes are stacked, but you're not rotating headers, you can hover over the icon to see the note title.

## 3.2.0
