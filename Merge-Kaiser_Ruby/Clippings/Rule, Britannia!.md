"**Rule, Britannia!**" is a British [patriotic song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism "Patriotism"), originating from the 1740 poem "Rule, Britannia" by [James Thomson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thomson_\(poet,_born_1700\) "James Thomson (poet, born 1700)")[^odnb-1] and set to music by [Thomas Arne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Arne "Thomas Arne") in the same year.[^2] It is most strongly associated with the [Royal Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy"), but is also used by the [British Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army "British Army").[^3]

> When Britain first, at Heaven's command  
> Arose from out the azure main;  
> This was the charter of the land,  
> And guardian angels sung this strain:
> 
> "Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:  
> "Britons never will be slaves."
> 
> The nations, not so blest as thee,  
> Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall;  
> While thou shalt flourish great and free,  
> The dread and envy of them all.
> 
> "Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:  
> "Britons never will be slaves."
> 
> Still more majestic shalt thou rise,  
> More dreadful, from each foreign stroke;  
> As the loud blast that tears the skies,  
> Serves but to root thy native oak.
> 
> "Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:  
> "Britons never will be slaves."
> 
> Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame:  
> All their attempts to bend thee down,  
> Will but arouse thy generous flame;  
> But work their woe, and thy renown.
> 
> "Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:  
> "Britons never will be slaves."
> 
> To thee belongs the rural reign;  
> Thy cities shall with commerce shine:  
> All thine shall be the subject main,  
> And every shore it circles thine.
> 
> "Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:  
> "Britons never will be slaves."
> 
> The Muses, still with freedom found,  
> Shall to thy happy coast repair;  
> Blest Isle! With matchless beauty crown'd,  
> And manly hearts to guard the fair.
> 
> "Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:  
> "Britons never will be slaves."

"Rule, Britannia!" soon developed an independent life of its own, separate from the masque of which it had formed a part. First heard in London in 1745, it achieved instant popularity. It quickly became so well known that [Handel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel "George Frideric Handel") quoted it in his *[Occasional Oratorio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occasional_Oratorio "Occasional Oratorio")* in the following year. Handel used the first phrase as part of the Act II soprano aria, "Prophetic visions strike my eye", when the soprano sings it at the words "War shall cease, welcome peace!"[^7] The song was seized upon by the [Jacobites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism "Jacobitism"), who altered Thomson's words to a pro-Jacobite version.[^8]

According to Armitage[^9] "Rule, Britannia" was the most lasting expression of the conception of Britain and the British Empire that emerged in the 1730s, "predicated on a mixture of adulterated mercantilism, nationalistic anxiety and libertarian fervour". He equates the song with [Bolingbroke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_St_John,_1st_Viscount_Bolingbroke "Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke")'s *On the Idea of a Patriot King* (1738), also written for the private circle of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in which Bolingbroke had "raised the spectre of permanent standing armies that might be turned against the British people rather than their enemies".[^10] Hence British naval power could be equated with civil liberty, since an island nation with a strong navy to defend it could afford to dispense with a [standing army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_army "Standing army") which, since the time of [Cromwell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell "Oliver Cromwell"), was seen as a threat and a source of tyranny.

At the time it appeared, the song was not a celebration of an existing state of naval affairs, but an exhortation. Although the [Dutch Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic"), which in the 17th century presented a major challenge to English sea power, was obviously past its peak by 1745, Britain did not yet "rule the waves", although, since it was written during the [War of Jenkins' Ear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Jenkins%27_Ear "War of Jenkins' Ear"), it could be argued that the words referred to the alleged Spanish aggression against British merchant vessels that caused the war. The time was still to come when the Royal Navy would be an unchallenged dominant force on the oceans. The jesting lyrics of the mid-18th century would assume a material and patriotic significance by the end of the 19th century.

*Britannia rule the waves*: decorated plate made in [Liverpool](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool "Liverpool") circa 1793–1794 ([Musée de la Révolution française](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_de_la_R%C3%A9volution_fran%C3%A7aise "Musée de la Révolution française")).

"Rule, Britannia!" is often written as simply "Rule Britannia", omitting both the comma and the exclamation mark, which changes the interpretation of the lyric by altering the punctuation. [Richard Dawkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins") recounts in his 1976 book *[The Selfish Gene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene "The Selfish Gene")* that the repeated exclamation "Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!" is often rendered as "Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule**s** the waves!", changing the meaning of the verse. This addition of a terminal 's' to the lyrics is used as an example of a successful [meme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme "Meme").[^11]

Maurice Willson Disher notes that the change from "Britannia, rule the waves" to "Britannia rules the waves" occurred in the Victorian era, at a time when the British did rule the waves and no longer needed to be exhorted to rule them. Disher also notes that the Victorians changed ["will" to "shall"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shall_and_will "Shall and will") in the line "Britons never shall be slaves".[^12]

The song assumed extra significance in 1945 at the conclusion of [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") when it was played at the ceremonial surrender of the [Japanese imperial army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_imperial_army "Japanese imperial army") in [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"). A massed military band of [Australian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Australian_Imperial_Force "Second Australian Imperial Force"), [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army "British Army") and [American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army "US Army") forces played as Supreme Allied Commander [Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma "Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma") arrived.[^13]

"Rule, Britannia!" (in an orchestral arrangement by Sir [Malcolm Sargent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Sargent "Malcolm Sargent")) is traditionally performed at the [BBC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC")'s [Last Night of the Proms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Proms#Last_Night_of_the_Proms "The Proms"), normally with a guest soloist (past performers have included [Jane Eaglen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eaglen "Jane Eaglen"), [Bryn Terfel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Terfel "Bryn Terfel"), [Thomas Hampson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hampson_\(baritone\) "Thomas Hampson (baritone)"), [Joseph Calleja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Calleja "Joseph Calleja"), and [Felicity Lott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicity_Lott "Felicity Lott")). It has always been the last part of Sir [Henry Wood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wood "Henry Wood")'s 1905 [Fantasia on British Sea Songs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_on_British_Sea_Songs "Fantasia on British Sea Songs"), except that for many years up until 2000, the Sargent arrangement has been used. However, in recent years the inclusion of the song and other patriotic tunes has been much criticised—notably by [Leonard Slatkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Slatkin "Leonard Slatkin")—and the presentation has been occasionally amended.[^14] For some years the performance at the Last Night of the Proms reverted to Sir Henry Wood's original arrangement. When Bryn Terfel performed it at the Proms in 1994 and 2008 he sang the third verse in [Welsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language"). The text is available at *[Rule Britannia](https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_Britannia "cy:Rule Britannia")* (in Welsh).
