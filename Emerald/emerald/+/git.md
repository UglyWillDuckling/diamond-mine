**Git** is a popular version control system used for  source code management
 and coordinating work among programmers collaborating on a project. 
  It allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without
 overwriting each other's changes, and provides a way to track and manage
 changes to the codebase over time.

Git is free and open-source, and is widely used in software development, and other fields  where version control is important. 
It is known for its speed, efficiency, and powerful features, such as [[git branching|branching]]
  and [[git merging]], that make it a popular choice among developers.
