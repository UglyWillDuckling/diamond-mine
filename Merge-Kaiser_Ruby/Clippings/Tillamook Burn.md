The **Tillamook Burn** was a series of [forest fires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_fire "Forest fire") in the [Northern Oregon Coast Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Oregon_Coast_Range "Northern Oregon Coast Range") of [Oregon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon "Oregon") in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") that destroyed a total area of 350,000 acres (140,000 hectares) of [old growth timber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_growth_forest "Old growth forest") in what is now known as the [Tillamook State Forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillamook_State_Forest "Tillamook State Forest"). There were four wildfires in this series, which spanned the years of 1933–1951. By association, the name Tillamook Burn also refers to the location of these fires. This event is an important part of Oregon's history.

The first fire started in a ravine at the headwaters of [Gales Creek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gales_Creek_\(Oregon\) "Gales Creek (Oregon)") on August 14, 1933. The exact cause of the first fire is unknown; however, the common narrative states that as logging crews were wrapping up operations early due to fire hazard restrictions, a steel cable dragging a fallen [Douglas fir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_fir "Douglas fir") rubbed against the dry bark of a wind-fallen [snag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snag_\(ecology\) "Snag (ecology)"). The snag burst into flame, and the wildfire that grew out of this burned 350,000 acres (140,000 ha) before it was extinguished by seasonal rains on September 5.[^argus-1] An oppressive, acrid smoke filled the neighboring valleys; ashes, and cinders, and the charred needles of trees fell in the streets of [Tillamook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillamook,_Oregon "Tillamook, Oregon"); and debris from the fire reached ships 500 miles (800 km) at sea. A [Civilian Conservation Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps "Civilian Conservation Corps") member was the only known human casualty of fighting the fire.[^argus-1] The loss in processed lumber was estimated to have been $442.4 million in contemporary (1933) dollars—a serious loss not only to the [timber industry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_industry "Timber industry") at the time, but also to a nation struggling with the [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). A massive salvage operation was immediately begun to harvest usable portions of the burned wilderness.

The speed with which a forest fire can spread in heavy fuels under the most hazardous conditions is well illustrated by this fire. From August 14 at 1 p.m. until the early morning of August 24 the fire had burned about 40,320 acres (16,320 ha) and it appeared that it might be brought under control soon. Thus, for over 10 days it had burned at an average rate of about 3,840 acres (1,550 ha) a day. On August 24, the humidity dropped rapidly to 26 percent and hot gale-force winds from the east sprang up. During the next 20 hours of August 24 and 25 the fire burned over an additional 268,800 acres (108,800 ha), or at a rate of 13,440 acres (5,440 ha) per hour along a 15-mile (24 km) front. The fire was stopped only by the fact that the wind ceased and a thick, wet blanket of fog drifted in from the ocean.[^2]

The second fire was started in 1939, allegedly by another logging operation. It burned 190,000 acres (77,000 ha) before being extinguished, and was contained within the bounds of the earlier fire.

A third fire started on the morning of July 9, 1945, near the [Salmonberry River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonberry_River "Salmonberry River"), and was joined two days later by a second blaze on the [Wilson River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_River_\(Oregon\) "Wilson River (Oregon)"), started by a discarded [cigarette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette "Cigarette"). This fire burned 180,000 acres (73,000 ha) before it was put out. The cause of the blaze on the Salmonberry River was mysterious, and many believed it had been set by an [incendiary balloon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendiary_balloon "Incendiary balloon") launched by the [Japanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") (due to the fire occurring in the waning days of [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")), which had been carried to Oregon by the [jet stream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream").

The third fire was perhaps the best known, after the initial wildfire, because it affected much of the forested mountains along the popular highways between [Portland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon "Portland, Oregon") and the recreational destinations of the [ocean beaches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Coast "Oregon Coast"). This devastation remained visible to any traveler through the area as late as the mid-1970s.

The last fire started in 1951, and burned only 32,000 acres (13,000 ha). It was also confined within the burned-over area.

Poet and author [Albert Drake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Drake&action=edit&redlink=1 "Albert Drake (page does not exist)") titled a 1970s book of poems and essays, *Tillamook Burn*, from his experiences growing up in [Oregon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon "Oregon").[^7]

Folk singer [Sufjan Stevens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens "Sufjan Stevens") references the Tillamook Burn in his song "Fourth of July" from his album *[Carrie & Lowell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_%26_Lowell "Carrie & Lowell")*.[^8]

[Martin Milner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Milner "Martin Milner") mentioned the Tillamook Burn in the 1960 *[Route 66](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_66_\(TV_series\) "Route 66 (TV series)")* episode “Legacy for Lucia.”
