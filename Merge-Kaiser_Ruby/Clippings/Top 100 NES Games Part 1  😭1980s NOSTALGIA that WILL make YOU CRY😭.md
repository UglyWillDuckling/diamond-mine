Thinking about NES Calssic Games that people's played in the 80'/90' brings good vibes and nice memories.. I think Some people still enjoy filling their free time with some good old NES classics games.  
  
There are more than 1000 games (All Region) on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES),, and here are the Top 100 NES Games \[Part 1\] that (maybe) WILL make YOU CRIED while watching this.😭  
  
Actually, It's not about the top or best list of NES games, but maybe when you watch this video you'll remember some of the forgotten games from a lost childhood and want to play it again (Nostalgia), and this list is based on my own choice (Cuphu Version) just for the sake of a cool throwback.. ^-^
