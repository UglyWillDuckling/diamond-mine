Let's add a few more tools to our Boolean algebra toolbox. One of the more important tools we'll add is DeMorgan's Theorem, which allows us to move inverters back and forth through the logic gates of our expressions.  
  
Takeaways: At the completion of this lesson, each student should be able to:  
• prove DeMorgan's Theorem and other theorems of Boolean algebra and  
• use DeMorgan's Theorem to distribute inverses back to the inputs.
