Body:

My client has chosen a hosting plan with your hosting service and would now like to point her domain to her VPS IP.
As her domain register servce doesnâ€™t provide the ability to edit DNS records directly, we would like to use your DNS servers instead.
Do you think this makes sense?

How and where would we manage the domain after the transfer?
How long do you think the transfer would take?
