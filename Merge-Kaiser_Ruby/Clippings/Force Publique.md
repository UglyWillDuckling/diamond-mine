The ***Force Publique*** (French: [\[fɔʁs pyblik\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French "Help:IPA/French"), "Public Force"; [Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language"): *Openbare Weermacht*) was the [military](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military") of the [Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State "Congo Free State") and the [Belgian Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo "Belgian Congo") from 1885 to 1960. It was established after [Belgian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Land_Component "Belgian Land Component") officers travelled to the Free State to found an armed force in the colony on [Leopold II of Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium "Leopold II of Belgium")'s orders. The *Force Publique* was heavily involved in [atrocities in the Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State "Atrocities in the Congo Free State"), and also saw action in the [Congo Arab war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Arab_war "Congo Arab war"), [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). It was renamed to the [Congolese National Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo") in July 1960 after Congo gained independence from Belgian colonial rule.

To command his *Force Publique*, Leopold II was able to rely on a mixture of volunteers (regular officers detached from the Belgian Army), mercenaries[^footnoteabbott200910,_11-4] and former officers from the armies of other European nations, especially those of Scandinavia, Italy and Switzerland. To these men, service in the Congo Free State offered military experience, adventure and—as they saw it—an opportunity to participate in a humanitarian endeavour. From 1885 to 1908 the officer corps consisted of hundreds of Belgians and dozens of Scandinavians, with smaller numbers recruited from other nations.[^5]

Serving under these European officers was an ethnically-mixed African soldiery, who eventually became comparable to the [askaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askari "Askari") fielded by other European colonial powers. Many were recruited or conscripted from “warrior tribes” in the [Haut-Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haut-Congo "Haut-Congo"), others were mercenaries[^footnoteosterhammel2015441-6] drawn from [Zanzibar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Zanzibar "Sultanate of Zanzibar") and [West Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Africa "British West Africa")[^footnoteabbott200910,_11-4] ([Nigerian Hausas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_people "Hausa people")). The role required of the *Force Publique* was that of both defending [Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State "Congo Free State") territory and of internal pacification.[^7] In the 1890s, the *Force Publique* defeated the [African and Arab slavers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_slave_trade "Indian Ocean slave trade") in the course of the [Congo Arab war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Arab_war "Congo Arab war") (1892–1894), which resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.[^footnoteosterhammel2015441-6]

As time went on, the *Force Publique* began to increasingly recruit and to rely on Belgian officers and native Congolese soldiers, so that the white and black foreign mercenaries had been mostly phased out by 1908.[^footnoteabbott200910,_11-4]

Under Leopold II the *Force Publique* was described as an "exceptionally brutal army".[^footnoteosterhammel2015441-6] One major purpose of the Force was to enforce the rubber quotas and other forms of forced labour. Armed with modern weapons and the [chicote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicote "Chicote")—a bull whip made of [hippopotamus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus "Hippopotamus") hide—soldiers of the FP often took and mistreated hostages. Reports from foreign missionaries and consular officials detail a number of instances where Congolese men and women were [flogged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation "Flagellation") or raped by soldiers of the Force Publique, unrestrained by their officers and [NCOs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCOs "NCOs"). They burned villages they viewed as recalcitrant. There is evidence, including photographs, that FP soldiers cut off human hands, either as trophies, or to show that bullets had not been wasted,[^8] or (by cutting off the limbs of children) to punish parents viewed as not working hard enough in the rubber plantations.[^9]

During the Free State period, the *Force Publique* suffered from institutional problems. During the early years of the force, mutinies of black soldiers occurred several times. By the early 1890s, much of the eastern portion of the Free State was under the control of Arab ivory and slave traders (though the Government was able to re-establish control over the east by the mid-1890s).[^10] Organizational problems were also quite prevalent during the Free State era. With many *Force Publique* detachments being stationed in remote areas of the territory, some officers took to using soldiers under their control to further private economic agendas rather than focusing on military concerns.[^11] By the end of 1891, the force had 60 officers, 60 non-commissioned officers, and 3,500 black soldiers. Friendly tribes and militias were often used to help exert control over the outermost parts of the Free State.[^12] By 1900, the Force Publique numbered 19,000 men.[^13]

### Organisation and role

![[~/×/10b4723a44cae3ecccf174991daa93f6_MD5.jpg]]

*Force Publique* soldiers some time after 1910

Following the takeover of the Free State by the Belgian government in 1908, the new authorities reorganised the *Force Publique*. This process was rather slow, however, and was only completed during the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War").[^footnoteabbott20099%e2%80%9311-14] Though the new Belgian administration was "more enlightened" than its predecessor, it still tried to keep the cost of the colonial army low. As result, the proportion of commissioned Belgian officers to askaris (about one to a hundred) was very low by the standards of most colonial armies of this period.[^footnoteabbott200910,_11-4] The weaponry of the *Force Publique* also remained mostly outdated due to the tight budgetary constraints on the colonial administration. Most askaris were armed with single shot 11 mm [Albini-Braendlin rifles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albini-Braendlin_rifle "Albini-Braendlin rifle"), though the white cadres and units in [Katanga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katanga_Province "Katanga Province") were given better [Mauser Model 1889](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser_Model_1889 "Mauser Model 1889") rifles. Other weapons included [Maxim machine guns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun "Maxim gun"), smaller numbers of [Madsen machine guns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madsen_machine_gun "Madsen machine gun"), [Nordenfelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordenfelt_gun "Nordenfelt gun") 4.7 cm and [Krupp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krupp "Krupp") 7.5 cm cannons.[^footnoteabbott200911-15]

The uniforms of the old Free State remained in use among the *Force Publique* until the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"): Belgian officers wore white uniforms until late 1914,[^footnoteabbott200911,_31,_46-16] while the blue uniform (with red trim around the neck and down the front opening), red [fez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_\(clothing\) "Fez (clothing)") and [sash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sash "Sash") of the askaris was phased out in a series of changes during 1915–1917.[^footnoteabbott200931,_47-17] Thereafter, officers and askaris wore a variety of khaki uniforms.[^footnoteabbott200931,_46,_47-18]

The *Force Publique*, 1928

The *Force Publique* was organised into 21 separate companies (originally numbered but later known only by their names) each between 225 and 950 men strong, along with an artillery and an engineers unit. The entire force numbered over 12,100 men. The companies were as follows: Aruwimi, Bangala, [Bas-Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas-Congo "Bas-Congo"), Cateracts, [Équateur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89quateur_\(former_province\) "Équateur (former province)"), [Ituri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ituri_Interim_Administration "Ituri Interim Administration"), [Kasai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasai_region "Kasai region"), [Kwango](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwango "Kwango"), [Lac Léopold II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mai-Ndombe "Lake Mai-Ndombe"), [Lualaba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lualaba_District "Lualaba District"), Lulongo, Makrakas, Makua-Bomokandi, [Ponthiérville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponthi%C3%A9rville "Ponthiérville"), Rubi, [Ruzizi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruzizi_River "Ruzizi River")\-[Kivu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Kivu "Lake Kivu"), [Stanley Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyoma_Falls "Boyoma Falls"), [Stanley Pool](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Pool "Stanley Pool"), [Ubangi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubangi_River "Ubangi River"), and Uele-Bili. There were also six recruit training camps containing over 2,400 men.[^auto-19]

The separate companies comprising the *Force Publique* eventually grew to over 600 men each. Their constituent units, known as detachments, were so widely scattered that the force had no real military value. Rather the bulk of these sub-units consisted of small garrisons in fixed locations, with local policing functions.[^auto-19] It was intended that each administrative company form a *Compagnie Marche* of 150 men. Each *Marche* or field company was intended to have four Belgian officers and NCOs plus between 100 and 150 askaris. In principle, companies comprised two or three 50-man platoons. There were supposed to be enough companies to form three *Marche* battalions. Eight Congolese soldiers were promoted to NCO.[^auto-19]

The 2,875 men of the *Troupes du Katanga* constituted a semi-autonomous force of six companies: four *de marche* and two other infantry, plus a cyclist company and a battalion headquarters.

Lastly, there was the *Compagnie d'Artillerie et de Génie* (Artillery and Engineers Company) manning [Fort de Shinkakasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_de_Shinkakasa "Fort de Shinkakasa") at the mouth of the [Congo River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_River "Congo River") in [Boma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boma,_Kongo_Central "Boma, Kongo Central"). The fort contained eight 160mm guns manned by 200 men,[^auto-19] plus an equal-sized auxiliary force, which saw little or no service during the war.

Map of the 1916 campaign by the *Force Publique* during the [East African campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_campaign_\(World_War_I\) "East African campaign (World War I)")

In 1914, the *Force Publique*, including the Katanga companies, totalled about 17,000 [askaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askari "Askari") with 178 white officers and 235 white NCOs. The majority served in small static garrisons called *poste* with primarily a police role. With the outbreak of the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"), the Katangese units were organised in battalions (Ie, IIe, and IIIme) for military service in [Northern Rhodesia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rhodesia "Northern Rhodesia") and the eastern frontier districts of the [Belgian Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo "Belgian Congo"). The *Force Publique* was able to assemble another battalion from smaller units; originally called the IIIe, but changed to the 11e to avoid confusion with the Katanga IIIme battalion.

During the First World War (1914–18), an expanded *Force Publique* served against [German colonial forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutztruppe "Schutztruppe") in [Kamerun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamerun "Kamerun") and [German East Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa "German East Africa") ([Tanzania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania"), [Rwanda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda "Rwanda"), [Burundi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi "Burundi")), as part of the [East African campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_campaign_\(World_War_I\) "East African campaign (World War I)"). The *Force Publique* performed well on the battlefield, winning the respect of their British and Portuguese allies, as well as that of their German opponents.

The *Force Publique* in [German East Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa "German East Africa") during the First World War.

From 1916 onwards, the *Force Publique* grew to reach a strength of three mobile *Groupes* (brigades), Kivu, Ruzizi, and [Tanganyika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanganyika_\(territory\) "Tanganyika (territory)"), comprising a total of 15 battalions, from the static garrison and police force of 1914. However, it did take until late 1915 for the *Force Publique* to finish preparations for a large scale offensive on German East Africa. The [allied powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I"), the [British Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") and Belgium, launched a coordinated attack on the German colony; by 1916 the Belgian commander of the *Force Publique*, [Lieutenant-General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_military_ranks "Belgian military ranks") [Charles Tombeur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Tombeur "Charles Tombeur"), had assembled an army of 15,000 men supported by local bearers and advanced to [Kigali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali "Kigali"). Kigali was taken by 6 May 1916. The German army stationed in [Urundi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urundi "Urundi") was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army, and by 17 June 1916, [Ruanda-Urundi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruanda-Urundi "Ruanda-Urundi") was occupied. The *Force Publique* and the British [Lake Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Force "Lake Force") then started a thrust to capture [Tabora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabora "Tabora"), an administrative centre of central German East Africa. The army went on to take Tabora on 19 September after heavy fighting.[^20][^dvr-21] At the time of the [Battle of Tabora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tabora "Battle of Tabora") in September 1916, about 25,000 men were under arms; during the war their actions were supported by more than 260,000 local bearers.[^dvr-21] In 1916, Tombeur was made Military Governor of the Belgian Occupied East African Territories. After the [Mahenge offensive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahenge_offensive "Mahenge offensive") and the capture of [Mahenge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahenge "Mahenge") in 1917, the Belgian Congolese army controlled roughly one-third of German East Africa.[^dvr-21]

After the [First World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"), as outlined in the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles"), [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former [German East Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa "German East Africa") to Belgium. On 20 October 1924, [Ruanda-Urundi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruanda-Urundi "Ruanda-Urundi") (1924–1945), which consisted of modern-day [Rwanda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda "Rwanda") and [Burundi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi "Burundi"), became a [League of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") [mandate territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate "League of Nations mandate") under Belgian administration, with [Usumbura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bujumbura "Bujumbura") as its capital.[^22]

On 10 May 1919, the Belgian colonial administration issued a decree formally reorganising the *Force Publique* into two branches. The *troupes campées* was tasked with guarding the border and protecting the colony from external aggression, while the *troupes en service territoriale* was responsible for maintaining internal security. Battalions from the latter were assigned to every provincial capital, while companies were stationed at each district headquarters.[^footnotethomas2012305-23]

Congolese enlisting in the *Force Publique* during the Second World War, c. 1943.

After Belgium had surrendered to [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") on 28 May 1940, Governor-General [Pierre Ryckmans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Ryckmans_\(governor-general\) "Pierre Ryckmans (governor-general)") decided that the colony would continue to fight on the side of the Allies.[^24] With Belgium occupied, the contribution to the Allied cause by the [Free Belgian forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Belgian_forces "Free Belgian forces") from the [Belgian Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo "Belgian Congo") was primarily an economic one providing copper, wolfram, zinc, tin, rubber, cotton and more. Already prior to the war [uranium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") from the [Shinkolobwe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkolobwe "Shinkolobwe") mine had been shipped to New York; it was later used in the [Manhattan Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project "Manhattan Project") to produce the atomic bomb for [Hiroshima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima "Hiroshima").[^dvr-21] The military contribution was also important: the *Force Publique* grew to 40,000 in the course of the War, formed into three brigades, a river force and support units.[^25] It provided detachments to fight Italian forces during the [East Africa campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_campaign_\(World_War_II\) "East African campaign (World War II)") and serve as garrisons in West Africa and the Middle East.

At the end of 1940, the XI<sup>th</sup> Battalion of the *Force Publique* was placed at the disposal of the British forces in the [Anglo-Egyptian Sudan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_Sudan "Anglo-Egyptian Sudan"). The 3rd Brigade of the *Force Publique*, together with the XI<sup>th</sup> battalion (5,700 men), took part in the campaign in [Abyssinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinia "Abyssinia") in [Italian East Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_East_Africa "Italian East Africa"), arriving from the Congo via the Sudan. The troops took [Asosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asosa "Asosa") and [Gambela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambela,_Ethiopia "Gambela, Ethiopia") with little resistance, and shelled Italian forces at [Saïo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dembidolo "Dembidolo") on 8 June 1941.[^dvr-21] Their retreat [cut off](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sa%C3%AFo "Siege of Saïo"), the Italian troops surrendered to General [Auguste-Édouard Gilliaert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste-%C3%89douard_Gilliaert "Auguste-Édouard Gilliaert") on 7 July 1941, and included nine generals, among them General [Pietro Gazzera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Gazzera "Pietro Gazzera") and Count [Arconovaldo Bonaccorsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arconovaldo_Bonaccorsi "Arconovaldo Bonaccorsi"), 370 officers, and 2,574 NCOs and 1,533 native soldiers.[^dvr-21] About 2,000 additional native irregulars were sent home. The *Force Publique* lost about 500 men during the East Africa Campaign,[^26] among them 4 Belgians.[^dvr-21]

The *Force Publique* then helped to establish an overland route from [Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Colony "Lagos Colony") through [Fort Lamy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Djamena "N'Djamena") and the [Sudan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan") to [Cairo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo"). Between 1942 and 1943, an expeditionary force of 13,000 was sent to Nigeria. Nine thousand of these troops served in Egypt and [Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"). They returned to the [Belgian Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo "Belgian Congo") at the end of 1944 without having seen active service.[^27]

The *Force Publique* also sent the 10th Belgian Congo Casualty Clearing Station to the battle zone. Between 1941 and 1945, some 350 Congolese and 20 Belgians, under the command of Medical Colonel Thomas, worked together with the British medical services in Abyssinia, [Somaliland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaliland "Somaliland"), Madagascar and Burma. They especially proved their value serving with the Indian [XXXIII Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXIII_Corps_\(British_India\) "XXXIII Corps (British India)") on the [Upper Chindwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chindwin_River "Chindwin River"), where they were attached to the [11th (East Africa) Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_\(East_Africa\)_Division "11th (East Africa) Division").[^28] During the confusion inherent in jungle fighting, the Belgian medical unit found itself on one occasion in advance of the front line troops. This incident was later used by British officers to motivate the fighting troops to greater efforts ("even a hospital can do better").[^29]

### Final stages of Belgian rule

At the end of 1940, the *FP* headquarters, recognising the need for aviation support for the force, began forming the *Aviation militaire de la Force Publique* equipped with requisitioned civilian machines and based at [N'Dolo Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Dolo_Airport "N'Dolo Airport") in Leopoldville. The first machine purchased for the force was a [de Havilland DH.85 Leopard Moth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Leopard_Moth "De Havilland Leopard Moth") that entered service on 9 October 1940.[^baudoux-30]

For the remainder of the period of Belgium's rule, the *Force Publique* continued its joint military and police role, split into territorial units, charged with maintaining public order, and mobile units (between the wars known as *unites campees*) charged with territorial defence. There was a mutiny by the XIV battalion at [Luluabourg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kananga "Kananga") in 1944.

In 1945, the *FP* mobile units consisted of 6 battalions of infantry (the V battalion at [Stanleyville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanleyville,_Belgian_Congo "Stanleyville, Belgian Congo"), the VI battalion at [Watsa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watsa "Watsa"), the VIII battalion at Luluabourg, the XI battalion at [Rumangabo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumangabo "Rumangabo"), the XII battalion at [Elizabethville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubumbashi "Lubumbashi"), and the XIII battalion at [Léopoldville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9opoldville "Léopoldville")), 3 reconnaissance units, military police units, a brigade under training at Camp Hardy, still under construction at [Thysville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thysville "Thysville"), 4 coastal defence guns, and a small aviation element including 2 [De Havilland DH.104 Doves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.104_Dove "De Havilland DH.104 Dove").[^31]

[King Baudouin of the Belgians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudouin_of_the_Belgians "Baudouin of the Belgians") reviews the *Force Publique* on 29 June 1960, the penultimate day of Belgian rule

Between 1945 and 1960, Belgium continued to organise the *Force Publique* as an entity cut off from the people that it policed, with recruits serving in tribally mixed units and no more than a quarter of each company coming from the province in which they served. Tightly disciplined and drilled, the *Force Publique* impressed visitors to the [Belgian Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo "Belgian Congo") with its smart appearance, but a culture of separateness, encouraged by its Belgian officers, led to brutal and unrestrained behaviour when the external restraints of colonial administration were lifted in 1960. The infamous *[chicote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicote "Chicote")* was abolished in only 1955. The Belgian Government made no effort to train Congolese commissioned officers until the very end of the Colonial period, and there were only about 20 African officer cadets at military schools in Belgium on the eve of Independence. A separate [gendarmerie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie "Gendarmerie") was organised in 1959 drawn from the Territorial Service Troops of the *FP*. By July 1959, a total of 40 companies and 28 platoons of gendarmerie were either formed or in training.[^32]

In 1960, the *Force Publique* comprised 3 *groupements* (Groups) each of which covered two provinces.[^33] The 1st *groupement* had its headquarters at [Elisabethville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabethville "Elisabethville") in Katanga Province, according to Louis-Francois Vanderstraeten.[^34] The 2nd groupement covered Léopoldville and [Equateur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equateur "Equateur"). The 3rd groupement, commanded by a colonel whose headquarters was at [Stanleyville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisangani "Kisangani"), grouped F.P. units in [Kivu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu "Kivu") and [Orientale Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientale_Province "Orientale Province") (PO). It comprised 3 infantry battalions (each of approximately 800 men), seemingly including 6 Battalions at [Watsa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watsa "Watsa") (under Lieutenant Colonel Merckx in 1960),[^35] 2 battalions of [Gendarmerie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie "Gendarmerie") (each of approximately 860 men), a reconnaissance squadron (jeeps, trucks and armoured [M8 Greyhound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M8_Greyhound "M8 Greyhound") vehicles – approximately 300 men), a transport company, a military police company (approximately 100 men), a heavy mortar platoon, a combat engineer company and a training centre at Lokandu.[^36]

Vanderstraeten reported the dispositions of the *Force Publique* in July 1960 as:[^37]
