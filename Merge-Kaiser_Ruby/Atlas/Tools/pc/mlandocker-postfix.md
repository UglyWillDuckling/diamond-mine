## Tags

The MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH [SemVer](https://semver.org/) is used. In addition to the three number version number you can use two or one number versions numbers, which refers to the latest version of the sub series. The tag `latest` references the build based on the latest commit to the repository.

The `mlan/postfix` repository contains a multi staged built. You select which build using the appropriate tag from `base` and `full`. The image `base` only contain Postfix. The image built with the tag `full` extend `base` to include [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/), which provides mail delivery via IMAP and POP3 and SMTP client authentication as well as integration of [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates using [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/).

To exemplify the usage of the tags, lets assume that the latest version is `1.0.0`. In this case `latest`, `1.0.0`, `1.0`, `1`, `full`, `full-1.0.0`, `full-1.0` and `full-1` all identify the same image.

## Usage

Often you want to configure Postfix and its components. There are different methods available to achieve this. Many aspects can be configured using [environment variables](https://github.com/mlan/#environment-variables) described below. These environment variables can be explicitly given on the command line when creating the container. They can also be given in an `docker-compose.yml` file, see the [docker compose example](https://github.com/mlan/#docker-compose-example) below. Moreover docker volumes or host directories with desired configuration files can be mounted in the container. And finally you can `docker exec` into a running container and modify configuration files directly.

You can start a `mlan/postfix` container using the destination domain `example.com` and table mail boxes for [info@example.com](https://github.com/mlan/) and [abuse@example.com](https://github.com/mlan/) by issuing the shell command below.

```
docker run -d --name mta --hostname mx1.example.com -e MAIL_BOXES="info@example.com abuse@example.com" -p 127.0.0.1:25:25 mlan/postfix
```

One convenient way to test the image is to clone the [github](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix) repository and run the [demo](https://github.com/mlan/#demo) therein, see below.

## Docker compose example

An example of how to configure an web mail server using docker compose is given below. It defines 5 services, `app`, `mta`, `filt`, `db` and `auth`, which are the web mail server, the mail transfer agent, the SQL database and LDAP authentication respectively.

## Demo

This repository contains a [demo](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix/blob/master/demo) directory which hold the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix/blob/master/demo/docker-compose.yml) file as well as a [Makefile](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix/blob/master/demo/Makefile) which might come handy. Start with cloning the [github](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix) repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix.git
```

From within the [demo](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix/blob/master/demo) directory you can start the containers by typing:

```
make init
```

Then you can assess WebApp on the URL [`http://localhost:8008`](http://localhost:8008/) and log in with the user name `demo` and password `demo` .

```
make web
```

You can send yourself a test email by typing:

```
make test
```

When you are done testing you can destroy the test containers by typing

```
make destroy
```

## Persistent storage

By default, docker will store the configuration and run data within the container. This has the drawback that the configurations and queued and quarantined mail are lost together with the container should it be deleted. It can therefore be a good idea to use docker volumes and mount the run directories and/or the configuration directories there so that the data will survive a container deletion.

To facilitate such approach, to achieve persistent storage, the configuration and run directories of the services has been consolidated to `/srv/etc` and `/srv/var` respectively. So if you to have chosen to use both persistent configuration and run data you can run the container like this:

```
docker run -d --name mta -v mta:/srv -p 127.0.0.1:25:25 mlan/postfix
```

When you start a container which creates a new volume, as above, and the container has files or directories in the directory to be mounted (such as `/srv/` above), the directory’s contents are copied into the volume. The container then mounts and uses the volume, and other containers which use the volume also have access to the pre-populated content. More details [here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#populate-a-volume-using-a-container).

## Configuration / seeding procedure

The `mlan/postfix` image contains an elaborate configuration / seeding procedure. The configuration is controlled by environment variables, described below.

The seeding procedure will leave any existing configuration untouched. This is achieved by the using an unlock file: `DOCKER_UNLOCK_FILE=/srv/etc/.docker.unlock`. During the image build this file is created. When the the container is started the configuration / seeding procedure will be executed if the `DOCKER_UNLOCK_FILE` can be found. Once the procedure completes the unlock file is deleted preventing the configuration / seeding procedure to run when the container is restarted.

The unlock file approach was selected since it is difficult to accidentally *create* a file.

In the rare event that want to modify the configuration of an existing container you can override the default behavior by setting `FORCE_CONFIG=OVERWRITE` to a no-empty string.

## Environment variables

When you create the `mlan/postfix` container, you can configure the services by passing one or more environment variables or arguments on the docker run command line. Once the services has been configured a lock file is created, to avoid repeating the configuration procedure when the container is restated.

To see all available Postfix configuration variables you can run `postconf` within the container, for example like this:

```
docker-compose exec mta postconf
```

If you do, you will notice that configuration variable names are all lower case, but they will be matched with all uppercase environment variables by the container initialization scripts.

Similarly Dovecot configuration variables can be set. One difference is that, to avoid name clashes, the variables are prefixed by `DOVECOT_PREFIX=DOVECOT_`. You can list all Dovecot variables by typing:

```
docker-compose exec mta doveconf
```

## Milter support

Postfix communicates with external applications like mail filters (Milters), providing spam filtering, using the Milter protocol, which is similar to SMTP.

[Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/) is a fast, free and open-source spam filtering system, which has been tested with `mlan/postfix`. The [docker-postfix](https://github.com/mlan/docker-rspamd) repository provides a dockerized version of the Rspamd mail filter.

#### `SMTPD_MILTERS`

Communication with the [Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/) milter is configured by setting `SMTPD_MILTERS=inet:flt:11332`, which assumes that a Rspamd container, named `flt`, is reachable on the custom network.

#### `MILTER_DEFAULT_ACTION`

The [milter\_default\_action](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#milter_default_action) parameter specifies how Postfix handles Milter application errors. You can set `MILTER_DEFAULT_ACTION=accept` to proceed as if the mail filter was not present, when there are errors.

## Outgoing SMTP relay

Sometimes you want outgoing email to be sent to a SMTP relay and *not* directly to its destination. This could for instance be when your ISP is blocking port 25 or perhaps if you have a dynamic IP and are afraid of that mail servers will drop your outgoing emails because of that.

#### `SMTP_RELAY_HOSTAUTH`

This environment variable simplify a SMTP relay configuration. The SMTP relay host might require SASL authentication in which case user name and password can also be given in variable. The format is `"host:port user:passwd"`. Example: `SMTP_RELAY_HOSTAUTH="[example.relay.com]:587 e863ac2bc1e90d2b05a47b2e5c69895d:b35266f99c75d79d302b3adb42f3c75f"`

#### `SMTP_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL`

You can enforce the use of TLS, so that the Postfix SMTP server announces STARTTLS and accepts no mail without TLS encryption, by setting `SMTP_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL=encrypt`. Default: `SMTP_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL=none`.

#### `SMTP_TLS_WRAPPERMODE`

To configure the Postfix SMTP client connecting using the legacy SMTPS protocol instead of using the STARTTLS command, set `SMTP_TLS_WRAPPERMODE=yes`. This mode requires `SMTP_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL=encrypt` or stronger. Default: `SMTP_TLS_WRAPPERMODE=no`

## Forwarding rewrite

[PostSRSd](https://github.com/roehling/postsrsd), implementing a sender rewriting scheme (SRS), offer optional forwarding rewrite to avoid receiving servers flagging messages as spam.

## Incoming SMTPS and submission client authentication

Postfix achieves client authentication using SASL provided by [Dovecot](https://dovecot.org/). Client authentication is the mechanism that is used on SMTP relay using SASL authentication, see the [`SMTP_RELAY_HOSTAUTH`](https://github.com/mlan/#smtp_relay_hostauth). Here the client authentication is arranged on the [smtps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTPS) port: 465 and [submission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_submission_agent) port: 587.

To avoid the risk of being an open relay the SMTPS and submission ([MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_submission_agent)) services are only activated when at least one SASL method has activated. Four methods are supported; LDAP, MySQL, IMAP and password file. Any combination of methods can simultaneously be active. If more than one method is active, all authentication methods are attempted one after another.

A method is activated when its required variables has been defined. For LDAP, `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS` is needed in addition to the LDAP variables discussed in [LDAP mailbox lookup](https://github.com/mlan/#ldap-mailbox-lookup). MySQL needs `MYSQL_QUERY_PASS` in addition to the MySQL variables discussed in [MySQL mailbox lookup](https://github.com/mlan/#mysql-mailbox-lookup). And IMAP needs the [`SMTPD_SASL_IMAPHOST`](https://github.com/mlan/#imap-sasl-client-authentication-smtpd_sasl_imaphost) variable and password file require [`SMTPD_SASL_CLIENTAUTH`](https://github.com/mlan/#password-file-sasl-client-authentication-smtpd_sasl_clientauth).

Additionally clients are required to authenticate using TLS to avoid password being sent in the clear. The configuration of the services are the similar with the exception that the SMTPS service uses the legacy SMTPS protocol; `SMTPD_TLS_WRAPPERMODE=yes`, whereas the submission service uses the STARTTLS protocol.

### Authentication (SASL) Mechanisms

There are unavoidable limitations with [non-plaintext authentication mechanisms](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/password_schemes/#non-plaintext-authentication-mechanisms) and password storage schemes. If more than one non-plaintext authentication mechanism, e.g. CRAM-MD5, are enabled then the passwords must be stored in plain text.

### Password file SASL client authentication `SMTPD_SASL_CLIENTAUTH`

You can list clients and their passwords in a space separated string using the format: `"username:{scheme}passwd"`. Example: `SMTPD_SASL_CLIENTAUTH="client1:{plain}passwd1 client2:{plain}passwd2"`. For security you might want to use encrypted passwords. One way to encrypt a password (`{plain}secret`) is by running

```
docker exec -it mta doveadm pw -p secret

{CRYPT}$2y$05$Osj5ebALV/bXo18H4BKLa.J8Izn23ilI8TNA/lIHz92TuQFbZ/egK
```

for use in `SMTPD_SASL_CLIENTAUTH`.

### LDAP SASL client authentication `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS`

Using [LDAP with authentication binds](https://wiki.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/LDAP/AuthBinds), Dovecot, binds, using the SMTPS client credentials, to the LDAP server which that verifies the them. See [LDAP](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/ldap/) for more details.

The LDAP client configurations described in [LDAP mailbox lookup](https://github.com/mlan/#ldap-mailbox-lookup) are also used here. In addition to these, the binding `<user>` attribute needs to be specified using `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS`. The `<user>` attribute is defined in this way `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS=<user>=user`. To exemplify, if `uid` is the desired `<user>` attribute define `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS=uid=user`.

#### `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_PASS`

Dovecot sends a LDAP request defined by `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_PASS` to lookup the DN that will be used for the authentication bind. Example: `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_PASS=(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(uid=%u))`.

`LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_PASS` can be omitted in which case the filter is being reconstructed from `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_USER`. The reconstruction tries to replace the string `(mail=%s)` in `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_USER` with `(<user>=%u),` where `<user>` is taken from `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS`. Example: `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_USER=(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(mail=%s))` and `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_PASS=uid=user` will result in this filter `(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(uid=%u))`.

### IMAP SASL client authentication `SMTPD_SASL_IMAPHOST`

Dovecot, can authenticate users against a remote IMAP server (RIMAP). For this to work it is sufficient to provide the address of the IMAP host, by using `SMTPD_SASL_IMAPHOST`. Examples `SMTPD_SASL_IMAPHOST=app`, `SASL_IMAP_HOST=192.168.1.123:143`.

For more details see [Authentication via remote IMAP server](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/protocols/imap).

## Incoming destination domain

Postfix is configured to be the final destination of the virtual/hosted domains defined by the environment variable `MAIL_DOMAIN`. If the domains are not properly configured Postfix will be rejecting the emails. When multiple domains are used the first domain in the list is considered to be the primary one.

#### `MAIL_DOMAIN`

The default value of `MAIL_DOMAIN=$(hostname -d)` is to use the host name of the container minus the first component. So you can either use the environment variable `MAIL_DOMAIN` or the argument `--hostname`. So for example, `--hostname mx1.example.com` or `-e MAIL_DOMAIN="example.com secondary.com" `.

## Incoming TLS support

Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly called SSL) provides certificate-based authentication and encrypted sessions. An encrypted session protects the information that is transmitted with SMTP mail or with SASL authentication.

Here TLS is activated for inbound messages when either `SMTPD_TLS_CHAIN_FILES` or `SMTPD_TLS_CERT_FILE` (or its [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) and [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) counterparts) is not empty or `SMTPD_USE_TLS=yes`. The Postfix SMTP server generally needs a certificate and a private key to provide TLS. Both must be in [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) format. The private key must not be encrypted, meaning: the key must be accessible without a password. The [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(cryptosystem\)) certificate and a private key files are identified by `SMTPD_TLS_CERT_FILE` and `SMTPD_TLS_KEY_FILE`.

#### `SMTPD_USE_TLS=yes`

If `SMTPD_USE_TLS=yes` is explicitly defined but there are no certificate files defined, a self-signed certificate will be generated when the container is created.

#### `SMTPD_TLS_CERT_FILE`

Specifies the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(cryptosystem\)) [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) certificate file within the container to be used with incoming TLS connections. The certificate file need to be made available in the container by some means. Example `SMTPD_TLS_CERT_FILE=cert.pem`. Additionally there are the [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm), [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) or chain counterparts; `SMTPD_TLS_DCERT_FILE`, `SMTPD_TLS_ECCERT_FILE` and `SMTPD_TLS_CHAIN_FILES`.

#### `SMTPD_TLS_KEY_FILE`

Specifies the RSA PEM private key file within the container to be used with incoming TLS connections. The private key file need to be made available in the container by some means. Example `SMTPD_TLS_KEY_FILE=key.pem`. Additionally there are the DSA, ECDSA or chain counterparts; `SMTPD_TLS_DKEY_FILE`, `SMTPD_TLS_ECKEY_FILE` and `SMTPD_TLS_CHAIN_FILES`.

### TLS forward secrecy

The term "Forward Secrecy" (or sometimes "Perfect Forward Secrecy") is used to describe security protocols in which the confidentiality of past traffic is not compromised when long-term keys used by either or both sides are later disclosed.

Forward secrecy is accomplished by negotiating session keys using per-session cryptographically-strong random numbers that are not saved, and signing the exchange with long-term authentication keys. Later disclosure of the long-term keys allows impersonation of the key holder from that point on, but not recovery of prior traffic, since with forward secrecy, the discarded random key agreement inputs are not available to the attacker.

The built in utility script `run` can be used to generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters needed for forward secrecy.

```
docker exec -it mta run postfix_update_dhparam
```

### Let’s Encrypt LTS certificates using Traefik

[Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provide free, automated, authorized certificates when you can demonstrate control over your domain. Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is the protocol used for such demonstration. There are many agents and applications that supports ACME, e.g., [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). The reverse proxy [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) also supports ACME.

#### `ACME_FILE`, `ACME_POSTHOOK`

The `mlan/postfix` image looks for a file `ACME_FILE=/acme/acme.json` at container startup and every time this file changes certificates within this file are extracted. If the host or domain name of one of those certificates matches `HOSTNAME=$(hostname)` or `DOMAIN=${HOSTNAME#*.}` it will be used for TLS support.

Once the certificates and keys have been updated, we run the command in the environment variable `ACME_POSTHOOK="postfix reload"`. Postfix's parameters needs to be reloaded to update the LTS parameters. If such automatic reloading is not desired, set `ACME_POSTHOOK=` to empty.

So reusing certificates from Traefik will work out of the box if the `/acme` directory in the Traefik container is also mounted in the `mlan/postfix` container.

```
docker run -d -name mta -v proxy-acme:/acme:ro mlan/postfix
```

Note, if the target certificate Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) is changed the container needs to be restarted.

Moreover, do not set `SMTPD_TLS_CERT_FILE` and/or `SMTPD_TLS_KEY_FILE` when using `ACME_FILE`.

## Mailbox maps and authentication

When Postfix receives an message it uses mailbox maps to lookup the recipient's mailbox-path/username. If successful the message is accepted. Whether what the lookup returns is used as a mailbox-path or a username depends on if the messages will be delivered to a local mailbox or is transported for delivery elsewhere. See [delivery transport and mail boxes](https://github.com/mlan/#delivery-transport-and-mail-boxes) for an overview on delivery methods.

So one can imagine situations where Postfix is set up to lookup and pass on a username that is different from what dovecot is expecting when performing authentication. Using `DOVECOT_AUTH_USERNAME_FORMAT=%Ln` Dovecot can be made to drop the domain part, if present, from the supplied username, see [Dovecot core settings](https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/?highlight=auth_username_format) for details.

## Table mailbox lookup

Postfix can use a table as a source for any of its lookups including virtual mailbox and aliases. The `mlan/postfix` image provides a simple way to generate virtual mailbox lookup using the `MAIL_BOXES` and `MAIL_ALIASES` environment variables.

#### `MAIL_BOXES`

The `MAIL_BOXES` environment variable (empty by default) hold a space separated list of addresses and their mailboxes using the following syntax: `MAIL_BOXES="address address:mailbox"`. The mailbox will have the same name as the address if it is not explicitly given.

Using the `MAIL_BOXES` environment variable you simply provide a space separated list with all email addresses that Postfix should accept incoming mail to. For example: `MAIL_BOXES="receiver@example.com info@example.com"`.

The mailbox path is separated from the address by a colon `:`, like so; `MAIL_BOXES="receiver@example.com:receiver/inbox info@example.com:example.com/info/"`.

Mail is stored either in [mbox or maildir format](https://wiki1.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat). The mbox format is used unless the mailbox path ends with `/` in which case maildir format is used.

#### `MAIL_ALIASES`

Using the `MAIL_ALIASES` environment variable you simply provide a space separated list with email alias addresses that Postfix should accept incoming mail to, using the following syntax: `MAIL_ALIASES="alias:address alias:address,address"`. For example: `MAIL_ALIASES="root:info,info@example.com postmaster:root"`. The default value is empty.

## LDAP mailbox lookup

Postfix can use an [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) directory as a source for any of its lookups including virtual mailbox and aliases.

For LDAP mailbox lookup to work `LDAP_HOST`, `LDAP_USER_BASE` and `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_USER` need to be configured. LDAP can also be used for alias lookup, in which case use `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_ALIAS`. In addition LDAP can be used to lookup mail groups using `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_GROUP` and `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_EXPAND`. For detailed explanation see [LDAP client configuration](http://www.postfix.org/ldap_table.5.html).

If the LDAP server is not configured to allow anonymous queries, you use `LDAP_BIND_DN` and `LDAP_BIND_PW` to provide LDAP user and password to be used for the queries.

### Required LDAP parameters

#### `LDAP_HOST`

Use `LDAP_HOST` to configure the connection to the LDAP server. When the default port (389) is used just providing the server name is often sufficient. You can also use full URL or part thereof, for example: `LDAP_HOST=auth`, `LDAP_HOST=auth:389`, `LDAP_HOST=ldap://ldap.example.com:1444`.

#### `LDAP_USER_BASE`

The `LDAP_USER_BASE`, is the base DNs at which to conduct the searches for users. Example: `LDAP_USER_BASE=ou=people,dc=example,dc=com`.

#### `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_USER`

This is the filter used to search the directory, where `%s` is a substitute for the address Postfix is trying to resolve. Example, only consider the email address of users who also have `objectclass=posixAccount`; `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_USER=(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(mail=%s))`.

### Optional LDAP parameters

#### `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_USER`

As mentioned in [mailbox maps and authentication](https://github.com/mlan/#mailbox-maps-and-authentication) what the LDAP lookup returns can be used as a mailbox-path or a username depending on if the messages will be delivered to a local mailbox or is transported for delivery elsewhere. The default attribute to return is `LDAP_QUERY_ATTRS_USER=mail`. Use this variable if another attribute is to be returned.

#### `LDAP_GROUP_BASE`

The `LDAP_GROUP_BASE` is the base DNs at which to conduct the searches for groups. Example: `LDAP_GROUP_BASE=ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`.

#### `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_ALIAS`

This is the filter used to search the directory, where `%s` is a substitute for the address Postfix is trying to resolve. Example, only consider email aliases of users who also have `objectclass=posixAccount`; `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_ALIAS=(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(aliases=%s))`.

#### `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_GROUP`, `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_EXPAND`

To deliver mails to a member of a group the email addresses of the individual must be resolved. For resolving group members use `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_GROUP` and to expand group members’ mail into `uid` use `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_EXPAND`.

Example, only consider group mail from group who is of `objectclass=group`: `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_GROUP=(&(objectclass=group)(mail=%s))` and then only consider user with matching `uid` who is of `objectclass=posixAccount`; `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_EXPAND=(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(uid=%s))`.

#### `LDAP_BIND_DN`, `LDAP_BIND_PW`

The defaults for these environment variables are empty. If you do have to bind, do it with this distinguished name and password. Example: `LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com`, `LDAP_BIND_PW=secret`.

## MySQL mailbox lookup

Postfix can use an [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) database as a source for any of its lookups including virtual mailbox and aliases.

For MySQL mailbox lookup to work `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_DATABASE` and `MYSQL_QUERY_USER` need to be configured. MySQL can also be used for alias lookup, in which case use `MYSQL_QUERY_ALIAS`. For detailed explanation see [MySQL client configuration](http://www.postfix.org/mysql_table.5.html).

If the MySQL server is not configured to allow password less queries, you use `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` to provide authentication credentials for the queries.

### Required MySQL parameters

#### `MYSQL_HOST`

Use `MYSQL_HOST` to configure the connection to the MySQL server. When the default port (3306) is used just providing the server name is often sufficient. You can also use full URL or part thereof, for example: `MYSQL_HOST=db` or `MYSQL_HOST=db:3306`.

#### `MYSQL_DATABASE`

The `MYSQL_DATABASE`, is the database on which to conduct the searches for users. Example: `MYSQL_DATABASE=postfix`.

#### `MYSQL_QUERY_USER`

The `MYSQL_QUERY_USER` query is used to lookup the recipient, where `%s` is a substitute for the address Postfix is trying to resolve. To exemplify, lets assume that the table `users` within the database `postfix` is structured like this:

```
+----+----------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| id | userid   | password                                    | mail                 |
+----+----------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|  1 | receiver | {PLAIN-MD5}5ebe2294ecd0e0f08eab7690d2a6ee69 | receiver@example.com |
|  2 | office1  | {PLAIN-MD5}7c6a180b36896a0a8c02787eeafb0e4c | NULL                 |
+----+----------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------+
```

We can use the following query to find the recipient that matches the mail address being resolved: `MYSQL_QUERY_USER="select mail from users where mail='%s' limit 1;"`.

### Optional MySQL parameters

#### `MYSQL_QUERY_ALIAS`

The `MYSQL_QUERY_ALIAS` query is used to retrieve aliases from the database, where `%s` is a substitute for the address Postfix is trying to resolve.

#### `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

Use `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` to provide authentication credentials for MySQL queries. Example: `MYSQL_USER=admin`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret`. These environment variables are empty by fault.

#### `MYSQL_QUERY_PASS`

As mentioned in [incoming SMTPS and submission client authentication](https://github.com/mlan/#incoming-smtps-and-submission-client-authentication) Dovecot needs the `MYSQL_QUERY_PASS` to be defined to be able to lookup the user and password when performing authentication. The following would work with the `users` table shown above `MYSQL_QUERY_PASS="select password, userid as user from $(SQL_TAB) where userid = '%u'"`. See [Dovecot MySQL authentication](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/sql/#mysql) for details.

## Rewrite recipient email address `REGEX_ALIAS`

The recipient email address can be rewritten using [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) in `REGEX_ALIAS`. This can be useful in some situations.

For example, assume you want email addresses like `user+info@domain.com` and `user-news@domain.com` to be forwarded to `user@domain.com`. This can be achieved by setting `REGEX_ALIAS='/([^+]+)[+-].*@(domain.com)/ $1@$2'`. The user can now, with the mail client, arrange filters to sort email into sub folders.

## Delivery transport and mail boxes

The `mlan/postfix` image is designed primarily to work with companion software, like [Kolab](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvaps/kolab), [Kopano](https://cloud.docker.com/u/mlan/repository/docker/mlan/kopano) or [Zimbra](https://hub.docker.com/r/jorgedlcruz/zimbra/) which will hold the mail boxes. That is, often received messages are transported for final delivery. [Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) is one such transport mechanism. Nonetheless, if no transport mechanism is specified messages will be delivered to local mail boxes.

#### `VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT`

The environment variable `VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT` specifies how messages will be transported for final delivery. Frequently the server taking final delivery listen to LMTP. Assuming it does so on port 2003 it is sufficient to set `VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT=lmtp:app:2003` to arrange the transport.

If `VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT` is not defined local mail boxes will be managed by Postfix directly. The local mail boxes will be created in the directory `/var/mail`. For example `/var/mail/user@example.com`. See [`MAIL_BOXES`](https://github.com/mlan/#mail-boxes) for details on mailbox paths.

The `mlan/postfix` image include the [Dovecot, a secure IMAP server](https://dovecot.org/), which can also manage mail boxes. Setting `VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT=lmtp:unix:private/transport` will transport messages to dovecot which will arrange local mailboxes. The environment variable `DOVECOT_MAIL_LOCATION` can be used to set the [mailbox location template](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/mail_location/). Since Dovecot serves both IMAP and POP3 these mailboxes can be accessed by remote mail clients if desired.

The table below is provided to give an overview of the options discussed here.

| `VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT` | Final delivery |
| --- | --- |
| `=` | Postfix local mailbox `/var/mail/user@example.com` |
| `=lmtp:app:2003` | External LMTP host `app` take delivery |
| `=lmtp:unix:private/transport` | Dovecot local mailbox `/var/mail/user/inbox`, with IMAP and POP3 access |

## Mail delivery, IMAP, IMAPS, POP3 and POP3S

When [Dovecot](https://dovecot.org/) manages the mail boxes, see [`VIRTUAL_TRANSPORT`](https://github.com/mlan/#virtual-transport), mail clients can retrieve messages using both the [IMAP](https://www.atmail.com/blog/imap-commands/) and POP3 protocols. Dovecot will use TLS certificates that have been made available to Postfix, in which case IMAPS and POP3S connections will be possible, see [Incoming TLS support](https://github.com/mlan/#incoming-tls-support).

By default Dovecot refuses plain text authentication unless within a secure TLS connection. Sometimes, perhaps for testing, you want to enable plain text authentication for non-secure IMAP or POP3 connections. if so set `DOVECOT_DISABLE_PLAINTEXT_AUTH=no`.

## Message size limit `MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT`

The maximal size in bytes of a message, including envelope information. Default: `MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT=10240000` ~10MB. Many mail servers are configured with maximal size of 10MB, 20MB or 25MB.

## Logging `SYSLOG_LEVEL`

The level of output for logging is in the range from 0 to 7. The default is: `SYSLOG_LEVEL=5`

| emerg | alert | crit | err | warning | notice | info | debug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5** | 6 | 7 |

## Knowledge base

Here some topics relevant for arranging a mail server are presented.

## DNS records

The [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) is a [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical) and [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system) naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) or a private network.

### MX record

A mail exchange record (MX record) specifies the [mail server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server) responsible for accepting [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) messages on behalf of a domain name. It is a [resource record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_record) in the DNS. The MX record should correspond to the host name of the image.

## Implementation

Here some implementation details are presented.

## Container init scheme

The container use [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/), providing an init scheme and service supervision, allowing multiple services to be started. There is a Gentoo Linux [runit wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Runit).

When the container is started, execution is handed over to the script [`docker-entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/mlan/docker-postfix/blob/master/src/docker/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh). It has 4 stages; 0) *register* the SIGTERM [signal (IPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_\(IPC\)) handler, which is programmed to run all exit scripts in `/etc/docker/exit.d/` and terminate all services, 1) *run* all entry scripts in `/etc/docker/entry.d/`, 2) *start* services registered in `SVDIR=/etc/service/`, 3) *wait* forever, allowing the signal handler to catch the SIGTERM and run the exit scripts and terminate all services.

The entry scripts are responsible for tasks like, seeding configurations, register services and reading state files. These scripts are run before the services are started.

There is also exit script that take care of tasks like, writing state files. These scripts are run when docker sends the SIGTERM signal to the main process in the container. Both `docker stop` and `docker kill --signal=TERM` sends SIGTERM.

## Build assembly

The entry and exit scripts, discussed above, as well as other utility scrips are copied to the image during the build phase. The source file tree was designed to facilitate simple scanning, using wild-card matching, of source-module directories for files that should be copied to image. Directory names indicate its file types so they can be copied to the correct locations. The code snippet in the `Dockerfile` which achieves this is show below.

```
COPY	src/*/bin $DOCKER_BIN_DIR/
COPY	src/*/entry.d $DOCKER_ENTRY_DIR/
```

There is also a mechanism for excluding files from being copied to the image from some source-module directories. Source-module directories to be excluded are listed in the file [`.dockerignore`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file). Since we don't want files from the module `notused` we list it in the `.dockerignore` file:

```
src/notused
```
