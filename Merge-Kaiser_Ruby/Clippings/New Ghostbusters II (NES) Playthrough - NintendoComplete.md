A playthrough of Hal's 1992 license-based action game for the NES, New Ghostbusters II.  
  
Not to be mistaken with Activision's 1990 game Ghostbusters II (https://youtu.be/aCsdzo3NMTk ), Hal's take on the movie brings us a top-down "search and destroy" style game. It's too bad that it never saw a US release, because this is the best Ghostbusters game out there.  
  
Playing like an expanded take on Ghostbusters II for the Game Boy (https://youtu.be/RSpJyqd6wrM ), each stage has the Ghostbusters searching out and eliminating ghosts in levels designed around specific locales in the film. It lacks the length and difficulty of the American NES GB2 game, but the creative mechanics, responsive controls, and the stage locations all make New Ghostbusters II an real joy to play. You might occasionally find yourself or your AI partner getting caught up on the scenery, but overall, it carries with it the polish that you'd expect out of a game produced by HAL. You even get to play as Louis!  
  
The graphics are top notch for an NES game. The backdrops are all well detailed - furniture and trash are strewn all over the place, and the areas are all distinct and easily recognizable - and the chibi character sprites are cute and funny. The music is great too. Instead of endlessly looping the movie's title theme, you get a few catchy and appropriately "NES creepy" style tunes, and a lot of it carries a pretty unmistakable Kirby vibe.  
  
It may have been a couple of years late to the party, but New Ghostbusters II was a fantastic 8-bit cart that trounces Activision's sad money-grubbing efforts.
