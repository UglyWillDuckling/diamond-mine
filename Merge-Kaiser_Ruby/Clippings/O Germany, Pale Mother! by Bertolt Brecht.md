Let others speak of her shame,
I speak of my own.

O Germany, pale mother!
How soiled you are
As you sit among the peoples.
You flaunt yourself
Among the besmirched.

The poorest of your sons
Lies struck down.
When his hunger was great.
Your other sons
Raised their hands against him.
This is notorious.

With their hands thus raised,
Raised against their brother,
They march insolently around you
And laugh in your face.
This is well known.

In your house
Lies are roared aloud.
But the truth
Must be silent.
Is it so?

Why do the oppressors praise you everywhere,
The oppressed accuse you?
The plundered
Point to you with their fingers, but
The plunderer praises the system
That was invented in your house!

Whereupon everyone sees you
Hiding the hem of your mantle which is bloody
With the blood
Of your best sons.

Hearing the harangues which echo from your house,
     men laugh.
But whoever sees you reaches for a knife
As at the approach of a robber.

O Germany, pale mother!
How have your sons arrayed you
That you sit among the peoples
A thing of scorn and fear!

Analysis (ai): The poem "O Germany, Pale Mother!" by Bertolt Brecht is a powerful indictment of the German government's treatment of its citizens during the Nazi regime. The poem compares Germany to a "pale mother" who has been "soiled" by the actions of her sons. Brecht uses strong language to describe the poverty and oppression that many Germans faced during this time, and he accuses the government of lying and silencing the truth. The poem also criticizes the international community for praising Germany while ignoring the suffering of its people.

___
In terms of Brecht's other works, this poem is similar to many of his other political poems in that it uses strong language to criticize the government. However, this poem is unique in its focus on Germany and the Nazi regime. In terms of the time period, this poem is a product of the Weimar Republic, a period of great political and social unrest in Germany. The poem reflects the anger and disillusionment that many Germans felt during this time. (hide)
