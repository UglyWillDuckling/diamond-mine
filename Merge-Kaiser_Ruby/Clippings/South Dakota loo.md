**South Dakota** ([/ d ə ˈ k oʊ t ə /](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English");[^10] [Sioux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_language "Sioux language"): ***Dakȟóta itókaga***, pronounced [\[daˈkˣotaiˈtokaga\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA "Help:IPA")) is a [state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state") in the [North Central](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_North_Central_states "West North Central states") region of the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). It is also part of the [Great Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains "Great Plains"). South Dakota is named after the [Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_people "Dakota people") [Sioux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux "Sioux") tribe, which comprises a large portion of the population—with nine [reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation") in the state—and has historically dominated the territory.[^11] South Dakota is the [17th-largest by area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_area "List of U.S. states and territories by area"), the [fifth-least populous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population "List of U.S. states and territories by population"), and the [fifth-least densely populated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population_density "List of U.S. states and territories by population density") of the [50 United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states "List of U.S. states"). [Pierre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre,_South_Dakota "Pierre, South Dakota") is the [state capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States "List of capitals in the United States"), and [Sioux Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls,_South_Dakota "Sioux Falls, South Dakota"), with a population of about 213,900,[^12] is South Dakota's [most populous city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_South_Dakota "List of cities in South Dakota").[^13] The state is bisected by the [Missouri River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River "Missouri River"), dividing it into two geographically and socially distinct halves known as " [East River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River_\(South_Dakota\) "East River (South Dakota)") " and " [West River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_River_\(South_Dakota\) "West River (South Dakota)") ".[^14] South Dakota is bordered by [North Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota "North Dakota") to the north, [Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota "Minnesota") to the east, [Iowa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa "Iowa") to the southeast, [Nebraska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska "Nebraska") to the south, [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming") to the west, and [Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana "Montana") to the northwest.

[Humans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States") have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a [gold rush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills_Gold_Rush "Black Hills Gold Rush") in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of [Indian wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars "American Indian Wars"), ending with the [Wounded Knee Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre "Wounded Knee Massacre") in 1890. As the southern part of the former [Dakota Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Territory "Dakota Territory"), South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with [North Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota "North Dakota"). They are the 39th and 40th states admitted to the union; President [Benjamin Harrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison "Benjamin Harrison") shuffled the statehood papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state first.[^15]

Major events in the 20th century included the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl") and [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"), increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming. Eastern South Dakota is home to most of its population, and a variety of crops grow in the area's fertile soil. West of the Missouri River, [ranching](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch "Ranch") is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in [West River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_River_\(South_Dakota\) "West River (South Dakota)"). The [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills"), a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, is in the southwest part of the state, and contains [Mount Rushmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore "Mount Rushmore"), a major tourist destination. South Dakota has a temperate [continental climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate "Continental climate"), with four distinct seasons and precipitation levels ranging from moderate in the east to semiarid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American [grassland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland "Grassland") biome.

Several [Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") represented South Dakota for multiple terms in both chambers of [Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_\(United_States\) "Congress (United States)"), but the state government is largely controlled by the [Republican Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)"), whose nominees have won the state in each of the last 14 [presidential elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election "United States presidential election"). Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy to attract and retain residents. South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence its culture.

Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for several thousand years. The first inhabitants were [Paleoindian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoindian "Paleoindian") hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC.[^16] Between 500 AD and 800 AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived in central and eastern South Dakota. In the 14th century, the [Crow Creek Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow_Creek_Massacre "Crow Creek Massacre") occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the [Missouri River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River "Missouri River").[^17]

By 1500, the [Arikara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arikara "Arikara") (or Ree) had settled in much of the Missouri River valley.[^18] European contact with the area began in 1743, when the [LaVérendrye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Joseph_Gaultier_de_La_V%C3%A9rendrye "Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye") brothers explored the region. The LaVérendrye group buried a plate near the site of modern-day [Pierre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre,_South_Dakota "Pierre, South Dakota"), claiming the region for France as part of [greater Louisiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_\(New_France\) "Louisiana (New France)").[^19] In 1762 the entire region became part of the [Spanish Louisiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_\(New_Spain\) "Louisiana (New Spain)") until 1802.[^20] [^21] By the early 19th century, the [Sioux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux "Sioux") had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.[^22]

In 1803, the United States purchased the [Louisiana Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory "Louisiana Territory"), an area that included most of South Dakota, from [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte "Napoleon Bonaparte"), and President [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") organized the [Lewis and Clark Expedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition "Lewis and Clark Expedition") to explore the region.[^23] In 1817, an American fur trading post was set up at present-day [Fort Pierre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pierre,_South_Dakota "Fort Pierre, South Dakota"), beginning continuous American settlement of the area.[^24] In 1855, the U.S. Army bought [Fort Pierre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pierre,_South_Dakota "Fort Pierre, South Dakota") but abandoned it in 1857 in favor of [Fort Randall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Randall "Fort Randall") to the south.[^24] Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly, and in 1858 the [Yankton Sioux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankton_Sioux "Yankton Sioux") signed the [1858 Treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_treaties "List of United States treaties"), ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States.[^25]

[Deadwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota "Deadwood, South Dakota"), like many other [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills") towns, was founded after the discovery of gold.

Land speculators founded two of eastern South Dakota's largest present-day cities: [Sioux Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls,_South_Dakota "Sioux Falls, South Dakota") in 1856 and [Yankton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankton,_South_Dakota "Yankton, South Dakota") in 1859.[^26] In 1861, the [Dakota Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Territory "Dakota Territory") was established by the United States government (this initially included [North Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota "North Dakota"), South Dakota, and parts of [Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana "Montana") and [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming")).[^27] Settlement of the area, mostly by people from the eastern United States as well as western and northern [Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), increased rapidly,[^28] especially after the completion of an eastern railway link to Yankton in 1873.[^29]

In 1874, gold was discovered in the [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills") during a military expedition led by [George A. Custer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer "George Armstrong Custer") [^30] [^31] and miners and explorers began illegally entering land promised to the Lakota. Custer's expedition took place despite the fact that the [Sioux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux "Sioux") had been granted the entire western half of present-day South Dakota ([West River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_River_\(South_Dakota\) "West River (South Dakota)")) in 1868 by the [Treaty of Laramie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Laramie_\(1868\) "Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)") as part of the [Great Sioux Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_Reservation "Great Sioux Reservation").[^32] The Sioux declined to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and war broke out after the U.S. failed to stop white miners and settlers from entering the region.[^33] Eventually the U.S. won and broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five reservations, settling the [Lakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people "Lakota people") there.[^24] In 1980 the [Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court "United States Supreme Court") and Congress ordered [compensation to be offered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills_Land_Claim "Black Hills Land Claim") but the Lakota still refuse to accept it, insisting on return of their land.[^34]

A harvest in South Dakota, 1898

A growing population in the Dakota Territory caused political dissatisfaction between northern and southern territory residents, with the southern half being always more populated. Following the territorial capital being moved from Yankton to [Bismarck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarck,_North_Dakota "Bismarck, North Dakota") in the northern part, calls for dividing the territory increased. South Dakota held constitutional conventions in 1883, 1885, and 1889.[^35] Other account(s) state that the real reason for the split was a political lure for four Republican senators instead of two from the Republican dominated Dakota Territory and in their push to split the territory, Republican congressmen also ignored the uncomfortable fact that much of the land in the anticipated state of South Dakota belonged to the Sioux.[^36] [^37] Eventually, in the 1887 general election, Dakota Territory residents voted for the division, so it was divided in half and Republican President [Benjamin Harrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison "Benjamin Harrison") signed proclamations formally admitting South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.[^38] [^39] [^40] [^41] Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.[^41] [^42]

On December 29, 1890, the [Wounded Knee Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre "Wounded Knee Massacre") occurred on the [Pine Ridge Indian Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation "Pine Ridge Indian Reservation"). Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the [Lakota Sioux Nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_Sioux "Lakota Sioux"), the massacre resulted in the deaths of at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children.[^43] 31 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.[^43]

A South Dakota farm during the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl"), 1936. Normal [tillage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage "Tillage") practices turn South Dakota's fragile soil into a fine, loose powder that [blows away](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_erosion "Wind erosion"), and sometimes covered vehicles, equipment, and buildings with dust during the Dust Bowl.[^44]

During the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl "Dust Bowl") in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile [topsoil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsoil "Topsoil") was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined.[^45] The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank [foreclosures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreclosure "Foreclosure") and the general economic effects of the [Great Depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"), resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.[^46]

Economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war.[^47] In 1944, the [Pick–Sloan Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%E2%80%93Sloan_Plan "Pick–Sloan Plan") was passed as part of the [Flood Control Act of 1944](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1944 "Flood Control Act of 1944") by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota.[^48] Flood control, [hydroelectricity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity "Hydroelectricity"), and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.[^48]

In recent decades, South Dakota has been transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the mid-twentieth century, with the [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills") becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with [Citibank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citibank "Citibank") moving its credit card operations from [New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_\(state\) "New York (state)") to [Sioux Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls,_South_Dakota "Sioux Falls, South Dakota") in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate [caps on interest rates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Usury_statutes_in_the_United_States "Usury").[^49]

In 2007, the site of the recently closed [Homestake gold mine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestake_Mine_\(South_Dakota\) "Homestake Mine (South Dakota)") near [Lead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead,_South_Dakota "Lead, South Dakota") was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility, the [Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Science_and_Engineering_Laboratory "Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory").[^50] Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as [Rapid City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City,_South_Dakota "Rapid City, South Dakota") or Sioux Falls, or to other states.[^51] Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.[^52] Gallup-Sharecare State of American Well-Being Rankings in 2018 named South Dakota the happiest, healthiest state in the United States.[^53]

Terrain and primary geographic features of South Dakota

South Dakota is in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the [Midwest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwest "Midwest") by the U.S. Census Bureau;[^54] it is also part of the [Great Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains "Great Plains") region. The culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota have more in common with the [West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States "Western United States") than the Midwest.[^14] [^55] South Dakota has a total area of 77,116 square miles (199,730 km <sup>2</sup>), making the state the [17th largest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_area "List of U.S. states by area") in the Union.[^2]

[Black Elk Peak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Elk_Peak "Black Elk Peak"), formerly named Harney Peak, with an elevation of 7,242 ft (2,207 m), is the state's highest point, while the shoreline of [Big Stone Lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stone_Lake "Big Stone Lake") is the lowest, with an elevation of 966 ft (294 m).[^4] South Dakota is bordered to the north by [North Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota "North Dakota"); to the south by [Nebraska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska "Nebraska"); to the east by [Iowa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa "Iowa") and [Minnesota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota "Minnesota"); and to the west by [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming") and [Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana "Montana"). The geographical center of the U.S. is 17 miles (27 km) west of Castle Rock in [Butte County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_County,_South_Dakota "Butte County, South Dakota").[^4] The North American continental [pole of inaccessibility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility "Pole of inaccessibility") is between [Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen,_South_Dakota "Allen, South Dakota") and [Kyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle,_South_Dakota "Kyle, South Dakota"), 1,024 mi (1,648 km) from the nearest coastline.[^56]

The [Missouri River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River "Missouri River") is the largest and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the [Cheyenne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_River "Cheyenne River"), [James](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_River_\(Dakotas\) "James River (Dakotas)"), [Big Sioux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sioux_River "Big Sioux River"), and [White](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_River_\(Missouri_River\) "White River (Missouri River)") Rivers. Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly created by periods of glaciation.[^57] Additionally, dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: [Lake Oahe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahe_Dam "Oahe Dam"), [Lake Sharpe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Sharpe "Lake Sharpe"), [Lake Francis Case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Francis_Case "Lake Francis Case"), and [Lewis and Clark Lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Lake "Lewis and Clark Lake").[^58]

South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills").[^59] The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota. The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred by Native Americans, differs from its surroundings to such an extent it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota, and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as [West River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_River_\(South_Dakota\) "West River (South Dakota)") and [East River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River_\(South_Dakota\) "East River (South Dakota)").[^14] [^55]

[Badlands National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_National_Park "Badlands National Park")

Eastern South Dakota generally features higher precipitation and lower topography than the western part of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the [Coteau des Prairies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coteau_des_Prairies "Coteau des Prairies"), the [Dissected Till Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissected_Till_Plains "Dissected Till Plains"), and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the [Minnesota River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_River "Minnesota River") Valley and on the west by the James River Basin.[^57] Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the [James River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_River_\(Dakotas\) "James River (Dakotas)") through South Dakota from north to south.[^60] The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the [Pleistocene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene") epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota.[^61] These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of [glaciation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier") which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as [till](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till "Till"), over the area.[^62]

The [Great Plains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains "Great Plains") cover most of the western two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the [Missouri River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River "Missouri River") the landscape becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called [buttes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte "Butte").[^63] In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota [Badlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_National_Park "Badlands National Park"). Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell to the bottom of a large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.[^61] [^64] [^65]

The [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills"), a low mountain range, is located in Southwestern South Dakota.

The Black Hills are in the southwestern part of South Dakota and extend into [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming"). This range of low mountains covers 6,000 sq mi (16,000 km <sup>2</sup>), with peaks that rise from 2,000 to 4,000 feet (600 to 1,200 m) above their bases. The Black Hills are the location of [Black Elk Peak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Elk_Peak "Black Elk Peak") (7,242 ft or 2,207 m above sea level), the highest point in South Dakota and also the highest point in the United States east of the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains").[^4] Two-billion-year-old [Precambrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian "Precambrian") formations, the oldest rocks in the state, form the central core of the Black Hills.[^61] [^66] Formations from the [Paleozoic Era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic_Era "Paleozoic Era") form the outer ring of the Black Hills;[^67] these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago. This area features rocks such as [limestone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone "Limestone"), which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.[^67]

Much of western South Dakota features [buttes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte "Butte").

Much of South Dakota (except for the Black Hills area) is dominated by a temperate [grassland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland "Grassland") biome.[^68] Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, [deciduous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous "Deciduous") trees such as [cottonwoods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_sect._Aegiros "Populus sect. Aegiros"), elms, and [willows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow "Willow") are common near rivers and in [shelter belts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_belt "Shelter belt").[^69] [Mammals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals "Mammals") in this area include [bison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison "American bison"), [deer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer"), [pronghorn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronghorn "Pronghorn"), [coyotes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyotes "Coyotes"), and [prairie dogs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_dog "Prairie dog").[^70] The state bird, the [ring-necked pheasant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_pheasant "Common pheasant"), has adapted well to the area after being introduced from [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China").[^71] Growing populations of [bald eagles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_eagle "Bald eagle") are spread throughout the state, especially near the [Missouri River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River "Missouri River").[^72] Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of [walleye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walleye "Walleye"), [carp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp "Carp"), [pike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_\(fish\) "Pike (fish)"), [bass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_\(fish\) "Bass (fish)"), and other species.[^70] The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic [paddlefish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_paddlefish "American paddlefish").[^73]

Due to a higher elevation and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from that of the plains.[^74] The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of [pines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine "Pine"), including [ponderosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponderosa_pine "Ponderosa pine") and [lodgepole pines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_contorta "Pinus contorta"), as well as [spruces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruces "Spruces").[^75] Black Hills mammals include [deer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer"), [elk (wapiti)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk "Elk"), [bighorn sheep](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bighorn_sheep "Bighorn sheep"), [mountain goats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_goat "Mountain goat"), [pine marten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_marten "American marten"), and [mountain lions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_lion "Mountain lion"), while the streams and lakes contain several species of [trout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout "Trout").[^75] [^76] [^77]

Köppen climate types in South Dakota

South Dakota has a [continental climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate "Continental climate") with four distinct seasons, ranging from cold, dry winters to warm and semi-humid summers. During the summers, the state's average high temperature is often close to 90 °F (32 °C), although it cools to near 60 °F (16 °C) at night. It is not unusual for South Dakota to have severe hot, dry spells in the summer with the temperature climbing above 100 °F (38 °C) several times a year.[^78] Winters are cold with January high temperatures averaging below freezing and low temperatures averaging below 10 °F (−12 °C) in most of the state. The highest recorded temperature is 120 °F (49 °C) at [Usta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta,_South_Dakota "Usta, South Dakota") on July 15, 2006 [^79] and the lowest recorded temperature is −58 °F (−50 °C) at [McIntosh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntosh,_South_Dakota "McIntosh, South Dakota") on February 17, 1936.[^80]

Average annual [precipitation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation") in South Dakota ranges from [semi-arid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") conditions in the northwestern part of the state (around 15 inches or 380 mm) to semi-humid around the southeast portion of the state (around 25 inches or 640 mm),[^78] although a small area centered on [Lead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead,_South_Dakota "Lead, South Dakota") in the [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills") has the highest precipitation at nearly 30 inches (760 mm) per year.[^81]

South Dakota summers bring frequent, sometimes severe, thunderstorms with high winds, thunder, and hail. The state's eastern part is often considered part of [Tornado Alley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley "Tornado Alley"),[^82] and South Dakota experiences an average of 30 tornadoes each year.[^83] Severe [blizzards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard "Blizzard") and [ice storms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_storm "Ice storm") often occur during winter.

[Mount Rushmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore "Mount Rushmore") in the Black Hills

South Dakota has several sites administered by the [National Park Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service "National Park Service"). Two [national parks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks "National parks") have been established in the state, both in its southwestern region. [Wind Cave National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_Cave_National_Park "Wind Cave National Park"), established in 1903 in the [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills"), has an extensive cave network and is home to a large herd of [bison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bison "American Bison").[^88] [Badlands National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_National_Park "Badlands National Park") was established in 1978,[^89] and features an eroded, brightly colored landscape surrounded by [semi-arid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid "Semi-arid") grasslands.[^90] [Mount Rushmore National Memorial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore_National_Memorial "Mount Rushmore National Memorial") in the Black Hills was established in 1925. The sculpture of four U.S. Presidents was carved into the mountainside by sculptor [Gutzon Borglum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutzon_Borglum "Gutzon Borglum").[^91]

Other areas managed by the National Park Service include [Jewel Cave National Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_Cave_National_Monument "Jewel Cave National Monument") near [Custer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custer,_South_Dakota "Custer, South Dakota"), the [Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_National_Historic_Trail "Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail"), the [Minuteman Missile National Historic Site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuteman_Missile_National_Historic_Site "Minuteman Missile National Historic Site"), which features a decommissioned [nuclear missile silo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_missile_silo "Nuclear missile silo") and a separate missile control area several miles away, and the [Missouri National Recreational River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_National_Recreational_River "Missouri National Recreational River").[^92] The [Crazy Horse Memorial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse_Memorial "Crazy Horse Memorial") is a large mountainside sculpture near Mount Rushmore being built using private funds.[^93] [The Mammoth Site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mammoth_Site "The Mammoth Site") near [Hot Springs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Springs,_South_Dakota "Hot Springs, South Dakota") is another privately owned attraction in the Black Hills. It is a working paleontological dig and has one of the world's largest concentrations of mammoth remains.[^94]

At the 2022 estimate South Dakota's population was 909,824 on July 1, 2022, a 2.61% increase since the [2020 United States census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census "2020 United States census").[^97]

In 2020, 6.5% of South Dakota's population was reported as under 5, 24.5% under 18, and 17.7% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 49.7% of the population.[^98] As of the 2020 census, South Dakota ranked fifth-lowest in the nation in population and population density, only [North Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota "North Dakota"), [Alaska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska"), [Vermont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont "Vermont"), and [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming") have fewer residents.

Of the people residing in South Dakota, 65.7% were born in South Dakota, 31.4% were born in another U.S. state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 2.3% were born in another country.[^99] The top countries of origin for South Dakota's immigrants and refugees in 2018 were [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines"), [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), [Sudan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan") and [Ethiopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia").[^100]

The [center of population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_population "Center of population") of South Dakota is in [Buffalo County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_County,_South_Dakota "Buffalo County, South Dakota"), in the unincorporated county seat of [Gann Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gann_Valley,_South_Dakota "Gann Valley, South Dakota").[^101]

According to [HUD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development") 's 2022 [Annual Homeless Assessment Report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Homeless_Assessment_Report_to_Congress "Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress"), there were an estimated 1,389 [homeless](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless "Homeless") people in South Dakota.[^102] [^103]

In 2022, South Dakota had the lowest drug overdose death rate of any US state, at 11.3 per 100,000 people.[^104]

According to the 2022 census estimate, the racial composition of the population was:

Map of counties in South Dakota by racial plurality, per the 2020 U.S. census

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 25.4% of South Dakota's population younger than age 1 were 'minorities' as of 2011, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.[^110] [^111]

As of 2000, the five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-American "German-American") (40.7%), [Norwegian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian-American "Norwegian-American") (15.3%), [Irish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American "Irish American") (10.4%), [Native American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_\(U.S._Census\) "Native American (U.S. Census)") (8.3%), and [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-American "English-American") (7.1%).[^112]

German Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state, especially in East River (east of the Missouri River), although there are also large Scandinavian-descended populations in some counties. South Dakota has the nation's largest population of [Hutterites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterites "Hutterites"),[^113] a communal [Anabaptist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptist "Anabaptist") group which emigrated in 1874 from German-speaking villages in what today is [Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine") but at that time was part of the [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire").

[Indian reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation") in South Dakota

[American Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"), largely [Lakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people "Lakota people"), [Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux#Linguistics "Sioux"), and [Nakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakota "Nakota") (Sioux), are predominant in several counties and constitute 20 percent of the population in [West River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_River_\(South_Dakota\) "West River (South Dakota)"). The seven large Indian reservations in the state occupy an area much diminished from their former [Great Sioux Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_Reservation "Great Sioux Reservation") of West River, which the federal government had once allocated to the Sioux tribes. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and [New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico").[^114]

Five of the state's counties are wholly within the boundaries of sovereign [Indian reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation").[^115] Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; [Ziebach County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziebach_County,_South_Dakota "Ziebach County, South Dakota") ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009.[^116] The unemployment rate in [Fort Thompson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Thompson,_South_Dakota "Fort Thompson, South Dakota"), on the [Crow Creek Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow_Creek_Reservation "Crow Creek Reservation"), is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances.[^117] A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the [Pine Ridge Indian Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation "Pine Ridge Indian Reservation") did not have a telephone.[^118] The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.

In 1995, the legislature passed a law to make English the "common language" of the state.[^119] Since 2019, *"the language of the [Great Sioux Nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_Nation "Great Sioux Nation"), comprised of three dialects, [Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_language "Sioux language") "* is the official indigenous language.[^8] [^7] As of the 2000 census, 1.90% of the population age5 or older speak German at home, while 1.51% speak [Lakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language "Lakota language") or [Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_language "Dakota language"), and 1.43% Spanish.[^120] As of 2010, 93.46% (692,504) of South Dakota residents age5 and older spoke [English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") as their [primary language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_language "Primary language"). 6.54% of the population spoke a language other than English. 2.06% (15,292) of the population spoke Spanish, 1.39% (10,282) spoke [Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_language "Sioux language"), and 1.37% (10,140) spoke German. Other languages spoken included [Vietnamese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language") (0.16%), [Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") (0.12%), and [Russian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language") (0.10%).[^121]

Over the last several decades, the population in many rural areas has declined in South Dakota, in common with other Great Plains states. The change has been characterized as " [rural flight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_flight "Rural flight") " as family farming has declined. Young people have moved to cities for other employment. This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 of South Dakota's counties losing population between the 1990 and the 2000 census.[^122] During that time, nine counties had a population loss of greater than 10%, with [Harding County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harding_County,_South_Dakota "Harding County, South Dakota"), in the northwest corner of the state, losing nearly 19% of its population.[^122] Low birth rates and a lack of younger [immigration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration "Immigration") has caused the median age of many of these counties to increase. In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65,[^123] compared with a national rate of 12.8%.

The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along [Interstate 29](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_29_in_South_Dakota "Interstate 29 in South Dakota"), the Black Hills, and many [Indian reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservations "Indian reservations") have all gained population.[^122] As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas.[^124] [Lincoln County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_County,_South_Dakota "Lincoln County, South Dakota") near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010.[^125] The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state.[^122] South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.

A one-night stay in South Dakota is all that is necessary to qualify a person to claim residency in South Dakota. Residency in South Dakota has therefore become very popular among full-time travelers (persons who reside in [recreational vehicles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicles "Recreational vehicles"), aboard [cruise ships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ships "Cruise ships"), etc.).[^126]

According to the [Public Religion Research Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Religion_Research_Institute "Public Religion Research Institute") in 2020, 73% of the adult population were Christian.[^128] Per the [Pew Research Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center "Pew Research Center") 's separate 2014 study, the largest [religious denominations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination "Religious denomination") in Christianity by number of adherents as a percentage of South Dakota's population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 22 percent, evangelical Protestants with 25 percent, and mainline Protestants with 32 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 57 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 18 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions was <1% Muslim, <1% Hindu and 1% Buddhist.[^129] The number of [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism") people in South Dakota is under 400, the lowest total in any of the fifty states.[^130]

The largest Christian denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church with 148,883 members; the [Evangelical Lutheran Church in America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America "Evangelical Lutheran Church in America") (ELCA) with 112,649 members; and the [United Methodist Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Methodist_Church "United Methodist Church") (UMC) with 36,020 members.[^131] The ELCA and UMC are specific denominations within the broader terms 'Lutheran' and 'Methodist', respectively. Through the [Association of Religion Data Archives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Religion_Data_Archives "Association of Religion Data Archives") in 2020, Catholicism remained the largest Christian denomination, followed by the ELCA. Non-denominational Protestants numbered 63,992, becoming the third largest group of Christians throughout the state.[^132]

In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 72% of the state were Christian altogether, though Protestants were 48%, Catholics 22%, and Jehovah's Witnesses 2%. The religiously unaffiliated declined from 22% to 21% between 2020 and 2022. Other non-Christian faith groups with a substantial presence in the South Dakota were [Buddhism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") (3%), [New Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") (3%), and others at 1% altogether. Through the Association of Religion Data Archives 2020 study, there were 978 adherents to the [Baha'i Faith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "Baháʼí Faith") and 535 [Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States "Islam in the United States").[^132]

The current-dollar [gross state product](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_state_product "Gross state product") of South Dakota was $39.8 billion as of 2010, the fifth-smallest total state output in the U.S.[^133] The [per capita personal income](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita_personal_income_in_the_United_States "Per capita personal income in the United States") was $38,865 in 2010, ranked 25th in the U.S.,[^134] and 12.5% of the population was below the poverty line in 2008.[^135] CNBC's list of "Top States for Business for 2010" has recognized South Dakota as the seventh-best state in the nation.[^136] In July 2011, the state's unemployment rate was 4.7%.[^137]

The [service industry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_industry "Service industry") is the largest economic contributor in South Dakota. This sector includes the retail, finance, and healthcare industries. [Citibank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citibank "Citibank"), which was at one time the largest bank holding company in the United States, established national banking operations in South Dakota in 1981 to take advantage of favorable banking regulations.[^49] Today the [trust fund](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_fund "Trust fund") industry manages hundreds of billions of dollars and is known as [tax haven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven "Tax haven") for foreigners.[^138] [Government spending](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending "Government spending") is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product. [Ellsworth Air Force Base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsworth_Air_Force_Base "Ellsworth Air Force Base"), near Rapid City, is the second-largest single employer in the state.[^139]

[Ethanol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol "Ethanol") plant in [Turner County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_County,_South_Dakota "Turner County, South Dakota")

Agriculture has historically been the key component of the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, [corn (maize)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), [soybeans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybeans "Soybeans"), [wheat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat"), and [hogs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig "Pig").[^140] Agriculture-related industries such as [meat packing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_packing "Meat packing") and [ethanol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol "Ethanol") production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota is the sixth leading ethanol-producing state in the nation.[^141]

Another important sector in South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel to view the attractions of the state, particularly those in the [Black Hills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills "Black Hills") region, such as historic [Deadwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota "Deadwood, South Dakota"), [Mount Rushmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore "Mount Rushmore"), and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual [Sturgis Motorcycle Rally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgis_Motorcycle_Rally "Sturgis Motorcycle Rally"). The five-day event drew over 739,000 attendees in 2015; significant considering the state has a total population of 850,000.[^142] In 2006, tourism provided an estimated 33,000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion dollars to the economy of South Dakota.[^143]

South Dakota has 83,609 miles (134,556 km) of highways, roads, and streets, along with 679 miles (1,093 km) of [interstate highways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_highways "Interstate highways").[^144] Two major interstates pass through South Dakota: [Interstate 90](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90_in_South_Dakota "Interstate 90 in South Dakota"), which runs east and west through the southern half of the state; and [Interstate 29](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_29_in_South_Dakota "Interstate 29 in South Dakota"), running north and south in the eastern portion of the state. The I-29 corridor features generally higher rates of population and economic growth than areas in eastern South Dakota further from the interstate.[^122]

Also in the state are the shorter Interstates [190](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_190_\(South_Dakota\) "Interstate 190 (South Dakota)"), a [spur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spur_route "Spur route") into central Rapid City, and [229](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_229_\(South_Dakota\) "Interstate 229 (South Dakota)"), a [loop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_route "Loop route") around southern and eastern Sioux Falls. Several major [U.S. highways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Numbered_Highways "United States Numbered Highways") pass through the state. U.S. routes [12](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_12 "U.S. Route 12"), [14](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_14 "U.S. Route 14"), [16](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_16 "U.S. Route 16"), [18](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_18 "U.S. Route 18") and [212](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_212 "U.S. Route 212") travel east and west, while U.S. routes [81](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_81 "U.S. Route 81"), [83](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_83 "U.S. Route 83"), [85](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_85 "U.S. Route 85") and [281](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_281 "U.S. Route 281") run north and south. South Dakota and [Montana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana "Montana") are the only states sharing a land border that is not traversed by a paved road.

South Dakota contains two [National Scenic Byways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Scenic_Byway "National Scenic Byway"). The [Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norbeck_Scenic_Byway "Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway") is in the Black Hills, while the Native American Scenic Byway runs along the Missouri River in the north-central part of the state.[^145] Other scenic byways include the Badlands Loop Scenic Byway, the Spearfish Canyon Scenic Byway, and the Wildlife Loop Road Scenic Byway.

Railroads have played an important role in South Dakota transportation since the mid-19th century. Some 4,420 miles (7,110 km) of railroad track were built in South Dakota during the late 19th century and early 20th century,[^146] but only 1,839 miles (2,960 km) are active.[^147] [BNSF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNSF "BNSF") is the largest railroad in South Dakota; the [Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City,_Pierre_%26_Eastern_Railroad "Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern Railroad") (formerly the [Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota,_Minnesota_and_Eastern "Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern")) is the state's other major carrier.[^147] Other state carriers include [Dakota Southern Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Southern_Railway "Dakota Southern Railway"), [D&I Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%26I_Railroad "D&I Railroad"), [Ellis & Eastern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_%26_Eastern "Ellis & Eastern"), [Sunflour Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflour_Railroad "Sunflour Railroad"), [CPKC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPKC "CPKC"), and the [Sisseton Milbank Railroad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisseton_Milbank_Railroad "Sisseton Milbank Railroad"). Rail transportation in the state is mostly freight, but there are two passenger heritage railroads: the [Black Hills Central](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills_Central_Railroad "Black Hills Central Railroad") and the [Prairie Village, Herman, and Milwaukee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_Village,_Herman_and_Milwaukee_Railroad "Prairie Village, Herman and Milwaukee Railroad"). However, South Dakota is one of the two [contiguous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_contiguity "Geographic contiguity") states that lack [Amtrak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak "Amtrak") service. (South Dakota is the only contiguous state that *never had* Amtrak— [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming") used to be served by the [San Francisco Zephyr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Zephyr "San Francisco Zephyr") and the [Pioneer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_\(Amtrak\) "Pioneer (Amtrak)").) [^148]

South Dakota's largest commercial airports in terms of passenger traffic are the [Sioux Falls Regional Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls_Regional_Airport "Sioux Falls Regional Airport") and [Rapid City Regional Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City_Regional_Airport "Rapid City Regional Airport"). [Delta Air Lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines "Delta Air Lines"), [Frontier Airlines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Airlines "Frontier Airlines"), and [Allegiant Airlines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Airlines "Allegiant Airlines"), as well as commuter airlines using the brand affiliation with major airlines serve the two largest airports. Several other cities in the state also have commercial air service: [Aberdeen Regional Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Regional_Airport "Aberdeen Regional Airport"), [Pierre Regional Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Regional_Airport "Pierre Regional Airport"), and [Watertown Regional Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watertown_Regional_Airport "Watertown Regional Airport"), some of which are subsidized by the [Essential Air Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Air_Service "Essential Air Service") program.[^149]

Public transit played a large role in the development of cities in South Dakota. There were seven cities with a streetcar system in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, however, all of these were discontinued over time. Today, only three fixed route public transit systems exist in the state, those being in [Sioux Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Area_Metro "Sioux Area Metro"), [Rapid City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City_Rapid_Ride "Rapid City Rapid Ride") and on the [Yankton Reservation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YST_Transit "YST Transit").

Like other U.S. states, the structure of the government of South Dakota follows the same [separation of powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") as the [federal government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States"), with executive, [legislative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature "Legislature"), and [judicial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary "Judiciary") branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the [Constitution of South Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Dakota "Constitution of South Dakota"), the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.[^150]

The [Governor of South Dakota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota "Governor of South Dakota") occupies the executive branch of the state government.[^151] The current governor is [Larry Rhoden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Rhoden "Larry Rhoden"), a Republican. The state constitution gives the governor the power to sign into law or veto bills passed by the state legislature, to serve as commander-in-chief of the [South Dakota National Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_National_Guard "South Dakota National Guard"), to appoint a cabinet, and to commute criminal sentences or to pardon those convicted of crimes.[^152] [^153] The governor serves for a four-year term, and may not serve more than two consecutive terms.[^154]

The [state legislature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_Legislature "South Dakota Legislature") is made up of two bodies, the [Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_State_Senate "South Dakota State Senate"), which has 35 members, and the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_House_of_Representatives "South Dakota House of Representatives"), with 70 members. South Dakota is divided into 35 legislative districts,[^155] with voters electing two representatives and one senator per district.[^155] The legislature meets for an annual session which begins on the second Tuesday in January and lasts for 30 days; it also meets if a special session is called by the governor.[^155]

The judicial branch is made up of several levels. The [state supreme court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_Supreme_Court "South Dakota Supreme Court"), with four justices and a chief justice, is the highest court in the state.[^156] Below the supreme court are the circuit courts; 41 circuit judges serve in seven judicial circuits in the state.[^156] Below the circuit courts are the [magistrate courts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_jurisdiction "Limited jurisdiction"), which deal with lesser criminal and civil actions.[^156]

As of 2005, South Dakota has the lowest per capita total state tax rate in the United States.[^157] The state does not levy personal or corporate [income taxes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax "Income tax"),[^158] [inheritance taxes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_tax "Inheritance tax"),[^159] or taxes on [intangible personal property](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property "Personal property"). The state [sales tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax "Sales tax") rate is 4.2 percent.[^160] Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is six percent. The state sales tax does not apply to sales to [Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") on [Indian reservations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation "Indian reservation"), but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. [Ad valorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_valorem_tax "Ad valorem tax") property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. The [South Dakota Special Tax Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_Special_Tax_Division "South Dakota Special Tax Division") regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.[^161]

South Dakota is represented at the federal level by Senator [John Thune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thune "John Thune"), Senator [Mike Rounds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rounds "Mike Rounds"), and Representative [Dusty Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson "Dusty Johnson"). All three are Republicans. South Dakota is one of seven states with only one seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.[^162] In [United States presidential elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election "United States presidential election"), South Dakota is allotted three of 538 votes in the [Electoral College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_\(United_States\) "Electoral College (United States)").[^163] As in all other states except [Maine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine "Maine") and neighboring [Nebraska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska "Nebraska"), South Dakota's electoral votes are granted in a winner-take-all system.[^164]

South Dakota politics are generally dominated by the [Republican Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)"). Since statehood, Republicans have carried the state's electoral votes in all but five presidential elections: [1896](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1896_United_States_presidential_election "1896 United States presidential election"), [1912](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election "1912 United States presidential election") (by [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") 's [Progressive Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_\(United_States,_1912\) "Progressive Party (United States, 1912)")), [1932](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_United_States_presidential_election "1932 United States presidential election"), [1936](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_United_States_presidential_election "1936 United States presidential election") and [1964](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_United_States_presidential_election "1964 United States presidential election"). (Democrat [George McGovern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern "George McGovern") —a native South Dakotan—failed to carry his home state in [1972](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election "1972 United States presidential election").) Only Alaska has been carried fewer times by a [Democrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)").[^166] [^167] Additionally, a Democrat has not won the governorship since 1974. As of 2024, Republicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Democrats [^168] and hold supermajorities in both the state House [^169] and the state Senate.[^170]

Despite the state's general Republican and conservative leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, most notably in those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in [Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_D.C. "Washington D.C."). American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the Democratic candidate by a margin of 532 votes.[^171] [^172] Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator [Tom Daschle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daschle "Tom Daschle") was the Senate [minority leader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_leader "Minority leader") (and briefly its [majority leader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader "Majority leader") during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).[^173] Other prominent South Dakota Democrats include former presidential nominees [George McGovern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern "George McGovern") and [Hubert Humphrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey "Hubert Humphrey").

In 2016, South Dakota voted for Republican nominee [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") over Democratic nominee [Hillary Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton "Hillary Clinton") by a margin of 30%.[^174] In [2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_South_Dakota_gubernatorial_election "2018 South Dakota gubernatorial election"), Republican congresswoman [Kristi Noem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem "Kristi Noem") defeated Democrat [Billie Sutton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Sutton "Billie Sutton") in the gubernatorial election by a small margin, and Republican [Dusty Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson "Dusty Johnson") defeated Democrat Tim Bjorkman for the state's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.[^175] Noem was sworn in on January 5, 2019, making her the first female governor of the state.[^176]

Contemporary political issues in South Dakota include the costs and benefits of the [state lottery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_Lottery "South Dakota Lottery"),[^177] South Dakota's relatively low rankings in education spending (particularly teacher pay—recently the State Sales Tax was increased from 4% to 4.5% to finance an increase in teacher pay),[^178] and recent legislative and electoral attempts to ban abortion in the state.[^179] [^180]

A Republican-supported bill passed in March 2019 requires that all public schools display " [In God We Trust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust "In God We Trust") " in a prominent location.[^181] [^182]

In a 2020 study, South Dakota was ranked as the 22nd hardest state for citizens to vote in.[^183]

South Dakota's culture reflects the state's American Indian, rural, Western, and European roots.[^184] A number of annual events celebrating the state's ethnic and historical heritage take place around the state, such as Days of '76 in [Deadwood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota "Deadwood, South Dakota"),[^185] Czech Days in [Tabor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabor,_South_Dakota "Tabor, South Dakota"),[^186] and the annual [St. Patrick's Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Day "St. Patrick's Day") and [Cinco de Mayo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo "Cinco de Mayo") festivities in Sioux Falls.
