Bardem married actress [Penélope Cruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz "Penélope Cruz") in 2010 and together they have two children. In January 2018, Bardem became the ambassador of [Greenpeace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace "Greenpeace") for the protection of [Antarctica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica").[^1]

Bardem was born on 1 March 1969 in [Las Palmas de Gran Canaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Palmas_de_Gran_Canaria "Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"), in the [Canary Islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands "Canary Islands"), Spain. His mother, [Pilar Bardem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilar_Bardem "Pilar Bardem") (1939–2021), was an actress, and his father, José Carlos Encinas Doussinague (1931–1995), was the son of a cattle rancher from the [province of Salamanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Salamanca "Province of Salamanca").[^2] According to Pilar's memoirs, José had a "capricious and violent will," and shot up the front door. He changed jobs more than 10 times, leading to evictions and the children going hungry. The two separated shortly after Javier's birth.[^3] [^4] His mother raised him and his elder siblings, [Carlos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Bardem "Carlos Bardem") and [Mónica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B3nica_Bardem "Mónica Bardem"), alone (another sibling died shortly after birth), both of whom have also pursued an acting career. His father died of leukemia in 1995.[^2] [^5]

On his mother’s side, Bardem comes from a long line of filmmakers and actors dating back to the earliest days of Spanish cinema. He is a grandson of actors [Rafael Bardem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Bardem "Rafael Bardem") and [Matilde Muñoz Sampedro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilde_Mu%C3%B1oz_Sampedro "Matilde Muñoz Sampedro") (sister of actresses [Mercedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Mu%C3%B1oz_Sampedro "Mercedes Muñoz Sampedro") and [Guadalupe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_Mu%C3%B1oz_Sampedro "Guadalupe Muñoz Sampedro")),[^6] and a nephew of screenwriter and director [Juan Antonio Bardem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Bardem "Juan Antonio Bardem").[^7] On the latter's side, he is a cousin of filmmaker [Miguel Bardem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Bardem "Miguel Bardem").[^8] His uncle Juan Antonio was imprisoned by the [Franco regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francoist_dictatorship "Francoist dictatorship") for his [anti-fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascist "Anti-fascist") films.[^5] Bardem was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith by his grandmother.[^9] [^10]

As a child, he spent time at theatres and on film sets.[^5] In 1974, he made his first television appearance, in [Fernando Fernán Gómez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Fern%C3%A1n_G%C3%B3mez "Fernando Fernán Gómez") 's television series *[El pícaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_p%C3%ADcaro&action=edit&redlink=1 "El pícaro (page does not exist)")* (*The Scoundrel*).[^11] [^5] [^12] He also played [rugby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football "Rugby football") for the junior Spanish National Team.[^13] [^14] Though he grew up in a family full of actors, Bardem did not see himself going into the family business, and painting was his preferred medium.[^15] He went on to study painting for four years at Madrid's [Escuela de Artes y oficios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escuela_de_Artes_madrid&action=edit&redlink=1 "Escuela de Artes madrid (page does not exist)").[^13] [^16] In need of money, he took acting jobs to support his painting but felt he was a bad painter and eventually abandoned it as a career.[^15]

In 1989, for the Spanish comedy show *El Día Por Delante* (*The Day Ahead*), he had to wear a [Superman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman "Superman") costume for a comedic sketch, a job that made him question whether he wanted to be an actor at all.[^17] Bardem also worked as a stripper (for one day) during his struggling acting career.[^18]

Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture, *[The Ages of Lulu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ages_of_Lulu "The Ages of Lulu")*, when he was 21, in which he appeared along with his mother, [Pilar Bardem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilar_Bardem "Pilar Bardem"). He also appeared in minor roles in *[Amo tu cama rica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amo_tu_cama_rica "Amo tu cama rica")* and *[High Heels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Heels_\(1991_film\) "High Heels (1991 film)")*.[^19] [Bigas Luna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigas_Luna "Bigas Luna"), the director of *Lulu*, was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film, *[Jamón Jamón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam%C3%B3n_Jam%C3%B3n "Jamón Jamón")* in 1992, in which Bardem played a would-be [underwear model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwear_model "Underwear model") and [bullfighter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighter "Bullfighter"). The film, which also starred his eventual wife [Penélope Cruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz "Penélope Cruz"), was a major international success.[^13] Bardem featured in [Sancho Gracia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancho_Gracia "Sancho Gracia") 's *[Huidos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huidos "Huidos")*,[^19] and starred in Bigas Luna's next film *[Golden Balls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Balls_\(film\) "Golden Balls (film)")* (1993).

Bardem's talent did not go unnoticed in the [English-speaking world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world "English-speaking world"). In 1997, [John Malkovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malkovich "John Malkovich") was the first to approach him, then a 27-year-old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor.[^14] [^20] His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with director [Álex de la Iglesia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lex_de_la_Iglesia "Álex de la Iglesia") 's *[Perdita Durango](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdita_Durango "Perdita Durango")*, playing a [santería](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa "Santería") -practicing bank robber.

Bardem at the [2007 Berlin International Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/57th_Berlin_International_Film_Festival "57th Berlin International Film Festival")

After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition in [Julian Schnabel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schnabel "Julian Schnabel") 's *[Before Night Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Night_Falls_\(film\) "Before Night Falls (film)")* in 2000, portraying [Cuban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba") poet [Reinaldo Arenas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinaldo_Arenas "Reinaldo Arenas").[^13] He received praise from his idol [Al Pacino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino "Al Pacino"); the message Pacino left on Bardem's answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received.[^5] For that role, he received a nomination for the [Academy Award for Best Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor "Academy Award for Best Actor"), the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of Danny Witwer in *[Minority Report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_\(film\) "Minority Report (film)")* which eventually went to [Colin Farrell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Farrell "Colin Farrell").[^21] Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in Malkovich's directorial debut, *[The Dancer Upstairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dancer_Upstairs_\(film\) "The Dancer Upstairs (film)")*. Malkovich originally had Bardem in mind for the role of the detective's assistant, but the movie's time trying to find financing gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. "I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English", Bardem has said of Malkovich.[^14] [^20]

Bardem won Best Actor at the [Venice Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival "Venice Film Festival") for his role in *[Mar Adentro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Adentro "Mar Adentro")* (2004), released in the United States as *[The Sea Inside](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Inside "The Sea Inside")*, in which he portrayed the [quadriplegic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriplegic "Quadriplegic") turned [assisted suicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_suicide "Assisted suicide") activist [Ramón Sampedro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Sampedro "Ramón Sampedro"). He made his Hollywood debut in a brief appearance as a crime lord who summons [Tom Cruise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise "Tom Cruise") 's hitman to do the dirty work of dispatching witnesses in the crime drama *[Collateral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_\(film\) "Collateral (film)")*. He stars in [Miloš Forman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo%C5%A1_Forman "Miloš Forman") 's 2006 film *[Goya's Ghosts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goya%27s_Ghosts "Goya's Ghosts")* opposite [Natalie Portman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman "Natalie Portman"), where he plays a twisted monk during the [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition "Spanish Inquisition").[^22]

In 2007, Bardem acted in two film adaptations: the [Coen brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers "Coen brothers") ' *[No Country for Old Men](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men "No Country for Old Men")*, and the adaptation of the [Colombian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia") novel *[Love in the Time of Cholera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_the_Time_of_Cholera_\(film\) "Love in the Time of Cholera (film)")* with [Giovanna Mezzogiorno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanna_Mezzogiorno "Giovanna Mezzogiorno") by [Gabriel García Márquez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez "Gabriel García Márquez"). In *No Country for Old Men*, he played a [sociopathic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder "Antisocial personality disorder") assassin, [Anton Chigurh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chigurh "Anton Chigurh"). For that role, he became the first Spaniard to win an [Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor").[^23] He won a [Golden Globe Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award") and [Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards "Screen Actors Guild Awards") for Best Supporting Actor, the [Critics' Choice Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics%27_Choice_Movie_Awards "Critics' Choice Movie Awards") for Best Supporting Actor, and the 2008 [British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts "British Academy of Film and Television Arts") for Best Supporting Actor.

Bardem's rendition of Chigurh's trademark quote, "What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?" (in response to the convenience store owner's query, "Y'all gettin' any rain up your way?"),[^24] was named Top HollyWORDIE of 2007 in the annual survey by the [Global Language Monitor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Language_Monitor "Global Language Monitor").[^25] Chigurh was named No. 26 in *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")* magazine's 2008 "50 Most Vile Villains in Movie History" list.[^26] Bardem's life's work was honored at the 2007 [Gotham Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_Awards "Gotham Awards"), produced by [Independent Feature Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Feature_Project "Independent Feature Project"). In 2014, Belgian psychiatry professor Samuel Leistedt and 10 associates watched 400 movies over the course of three years and identified 126 psychopathic characters: Bardem's rendition of Chigurh was voted the most realistic psychopath.[^27] [^28] [^29]

[Francis Ford Coppola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola "Francis Ford Coppola") singled out Bardem as an heir to, and even improvement on, [Al Pacino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino "Al Pacino"), [Jack Nicholson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson "Jack Nicholson") and [Robert De Niro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro "Robert De Niro"), referring to Bardem as ambitious, hungry, unwilling to rest on his laurels and always "excited to do something good." [^5] Bardem was attached to play the role of Tetro's mentor in Coppola's film *[Tetro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetro "Tetro")*, but the director felt the character should be female, so he was replaced by fellow Spaniard [Carmen Maura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Maura "Carmen Maura").[^30] [^31] Bardem was originally cast to play fictional filmmaker Guido Contini in the [film adaptation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_\(2009_live-action_film\) "Nine (2009 live-action film)") of the Broadway musical *[Nine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_\(musical\) "Nine (musical)")* but dropped out due to exhaustion.[^30] [^32] The part eventually went to [Daniel Day-Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis "Daniel Day-Lewis").[^33] He went on to star alongside [Penélope Cruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz "Penélope Cruz") and [Scarlett Johansson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson "Scarlett Johansson") in [Woody Allen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen "Woody Allen") 's *[Vicky Cristina Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicky_Cristina_Barcelona "Vicky Cristina Barcelona")* (2008) where he earned his fourth [Golden Globe Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award") nomination.

Bardem and his wife [Penélope Cruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz "Penélope Cruz") at the 32nd [Goya Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goya_Awards "Goya Awards") in 2018

In 2007, Bardem began dating [Penélope Cruz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz "Penélope Cruz"), his co-star in *[Vicky Cristina Barcelona](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicky_Cristina_Barcelona "Vicky Cristina Barcelona")*. Bardem and Cruz have maintained a low public profile,[^72] refusing to discuss their personal lives.[^15] The couple married in July 2010 in [The Bahamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas "The Bahamas").[^73] They have two children: a son, named Leo Encinas Cruz, born on 23 January 2011,[^74] in Los Angeles; and a daughter, named Luna Encinas Cruz, born on 22 July 2013, in Madrid.[^75]

In September 2018, at the [Toronto Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Film_Festival "Toronto Film Festival") premiere of *Everybody Knows* Bardem told *Ikon London Magazine* about acting together with his spouse: "I find it very easy. In a sense that we play what we are supposed to play and then we go back to our daily life which is way more interesting than any fiction. And it is real." [^76]

Bardem's native language is Spanish, and he is also fluent in English. He is a fan of [heavy metal music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music "Heavy metal music"), and credits the band [AC/DC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC "AC/DC") for helping him learn to speak English, in some respects.[^15] He is also a fan of [Pearl Jam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam "Pearl Jam").[^77] Bardem does not drive, only getting behind the wheel for film roles,[^13] [^78] and he refers to himself as a "worker" or "entertainer", not an actor.[^78] In 2024, he stated that he still saw himself as "the son of Pilar", adding that he did not want "to be anything else".[^67]

Although Bardem was raised as a [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), he is now [agnostic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic "Agnostic").[^79] [^80] He expressed his support of gay marriage [in Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Spain "Same-sex marriage in Spain"). Bardem emphasized that while [ego](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoism "Egoism") drives acting, it should not interfere with filmmaking.[^81] He later said that although he does not believe strongly in the [supernatural](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural"), he does not deny it. "We are just this little tiny spot in the whole universe, so of course there must be other things, other people, other creatures, other lives and other dimensions. Sure, I believe in it". In the same interview, Bardem stated that he thinks science and belief "should go together".[^82]

Despite the villainous characters he has played throughout his acting career, Bardem has a self-confessed "hatred" of violence that stems from a fight in a nightclub in his early 20s that left him with a broken nose.[^83]

In 2025, Bardem revealed that he is a fan of Spanish football club [Atlético Madrid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl%C3%A9tico_Madrid "Atlético Madrid") on the show *[Conan O'Brien Must Go](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien_Must_Go "Conan O'Brien Must Go")*.[^84]

Long committed to the plight of the [Sahrawi people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawis "Sahrawis"), Bardem served as spokesperson of the platform 'All with the Sahara', that collected signatures to ask the Spanish government to "lead the search for a peaceful and just solution to a conflict that affects us directly".[^85] Bardem produced and narrated the documentary film *[Sons of the Clouds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_the_Clouds "Sons of the Clouds")* about life in the [Sahrawi refugee camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_refugee_camps "Sahrawi refugee camps").[^86] In May 2011 Bardem teamed up with The [Enough Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enough_Project "Enough Project") 's co-founder [John Prendergast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prendergast_\(activist\) "John Prendergast (activist)") to raise awareness about [conflict minerals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_minerals "Conflict minerals") in eastern [Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo "Democratic Republic of Congo").[^87] In July 2019, Bardem signed a manifesto urging [PSOE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSOE "PSOE") and [Podemos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_\(Spanish_political_party\) "Podemos (Spanish political party)") parties to reach an agreement to form a ministry after the [April 2019 elections in Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2019_Spanish_general_election "April 2019 Spanish general election").[^88]

In November 2019, during the March for Climate in Madrid, Bardem gave a speech on stage where he called both the mayor of Madrid [José Luis Martínez-Almeida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Mart%C3%ADnez-Almeida "José Luis Martínez-Almeida") and the US president [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") "stupid". He later apologized, declaring that "the insult illegitimizes any speech and conversation." [^89]

During the [2014 Israel–Gaza conflict](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict "2014 Israel–Gaza conflict"), Bardem and Cruz signed an open letter denouncing Israel's actions as [genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_genocide_accusation "Palestinian genocide accusation").[^90] In September 2024, Bardem criticized Israel's [military operations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war") in the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") and the "unconditional support" of Israel by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany,[^91] saying that "Israel's extreme right-wing nationalist government is not at all representative of the Jewish community or Israeli society." [^92] In May 2025, Bardem signed a letter criticizing the film industry's "passivity" before the ongoing [Gaza genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide "Gaza genocide").[^93] In June 2025, Bardem told [The View](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View "The View") that Israel was committing genocide in Israel with the "back-up of the United States" and the "silence of Europe".[^94]
