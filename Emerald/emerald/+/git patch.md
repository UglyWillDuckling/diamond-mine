part_of:: [[git]]

 A **Git patch** is a **text file** that contains the difference between two versions of a file,
  or set of files, expressed in the [[Git diff format]]. 

  Patches are often used to share changes made to a codebase with others, or
  to apply changes to a different version of a file or codebase. In Git,
  patches can be generated using the  [[git diff  command]] and applied using the
  [[git apply  command]].
