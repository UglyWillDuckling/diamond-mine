Flamingo is a web framework based on Go.  
It is designed to build pluggable and maintainable web projects. It is production ready, field tested and has a growing ecosystem.

## Quick start

> See "examples/hello-world"

Initialize an empty project:

```
mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
go mod init helloworld
```

Create your project main file:

```
package main

import (
	"flamingo.me/dingo"
	"flamingo.me/flamingo/v3"
)

func main() {
	flamingo.App([]dingo.Module{
	})
}
```

If you then start your project you will see a list of registered commands:

It will print something like:

```
Flamingo main

Usage:
  main [command]

Examples:
Run with -h or -help to see global debug flags

Available Commands:
  config      Config dump
  handler     Dump the Handlers and its registered methods
  help        Help about any command
  routes      Routes dump
  serve       Default serve command - starts on Port 3322

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for main

Use "main [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

To start the server use the following sub command:

And open [http://localhost:3322](http://localhost:3322/)

**Hello World Example:**

To extend this empty flamingo project with a "Hello World" output please create a new module "helloworld" like this:

```
mkdir helloworld
cat helloworld/module.go
```

With the following code in `module.go`:

```
package helloworld

import (
        "context"
        "net/http"
        "strings"
        
        "flamingo.me/dingo"
        "flamingo.me/flamingo/v3/framework/web"
)

type Module struct{}

func (*Module) Configure(injector *dingo.Injector) {
        web.BindRoutes(injector, new(routes))
}

type routes struct{}

func (*routes) Routes(registry *web.RouterRegistry) {
        registry.Route("/", "home")
        registry.HandleAny("home", indexHandler)
}

func indexHandler(ctx context.Context, req *web.Request) web.Result {
        return &web.Response{
            Status: http.StatusOK,
            Body:   strings.NewReader("Hello World!"),
        }
}
```

This file now defines a very simple module, that can be used in the Flamingo bootstrap. In this case it registers a new handler that renders a simple "Hello World" message and binds the route "/" to this handler. Now please include this new module in your existing `main.go` file:

```
package main

import (
	"flamingo.me/dingo"
	"flamingo.me/flamingo/v3"
	"helloworld/helloworld"
)

func main() {
	flamingo.App([]dingo.Module{
        new(helloworld.Module),
	})
}
```

If you now run the server again

And open [http://localhost:3322](http://localhost:3322/) you will see your "Hello World!" output.

Other ways are:

- Ask in stackoverflow (we try to keep track of new questions)
- Write us an email: [flamingo@aoe.com](https://github.com/i-love-flamingo/)
- Open an issue in [github](https://github.com/i-love-flamingo/flamingo/issues) for bugs and feature requests

## Framework Details

## Feature List

- dependency injection with [Dingo](https://github.com/i-love-flamingo/dingo)
- Flexible templating engines. (gotemplates and [pugtemplates](https://github.com/i-love-flamingo/pugtemplate))
- configuration concepts using [cue](https://cuelang.org/) with support for multiple config areas and additional config contexts
- A module concept for building modular and pluggable applications based on Dingo
- Authentication concepts and security middleware
- Flexible routing with support for prefix routes and reverse routing
- Web controller concept with request/response abstraction; form handling etc
- Operational readiness: logging, (distributed) tracing, metrics and healthchecks with separate endpoint
- Localisation support
- Commands using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- Event handling
- Sessionhandling and Management (By default uses [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla/sessions))

## Ecosystem

- GraphQL Module (and therefore support to build SPA and PWAs on top of it)
- Caching modules providing resilience and caching for external APIs calls.
- pugtemplate template engine for server side rendering with the related frontend tooling **[Flamingo Carotene](https://github.com/i-love-flamingo/flamingo-carotene)**
- **[Flamingo Commerce](https://github.com/i-love-flamingo/flamingo-commerce)** is an active projects that offer rich and flexible features to build modern e-commerce applications.
