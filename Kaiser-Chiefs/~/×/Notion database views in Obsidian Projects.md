Have you ever wanted rotating Notion database views in Obsidian? Marcus Olsson's Obsidian Projects plugin does exactly that, letting you create Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views for the same notes in Obsidian, just like in Notion! Join us as Marcus shows us how this awesome new plugin works and how it can be used to display **the same data in different ways.**
