**Washington, D.C.**, formally the **District of Columbia** and commonly known as **Washington** or **D.C.**, is the [capital city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city "Capital city") and [federal district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_district_of_the_United_States "Federal district of the United States") of the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). The city is on the [Potomac River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"), across from [Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia "Virginia"), and shares land borders with [Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland "Maryland") to its north and east. It was named after [George Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington"), the first [president of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States"). The district is named for [Columbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_\(personification\) "Columbia (personification)"), the female [personification of the nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_personification "National personification").

The [U.S. Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States "Constitution of the United States") in 1789 called for the creation of a [federal district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_district "Federal district") under the [exclusive jurisdiction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_home_rule "District of Columbia home rule") of the [U.S. Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"). As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any [state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state"), and is not one itself. The [Residence Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_Act "Residence Act"), adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the [capital district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_districts_and_territories "Capital districts and territories") along the [[Potomac River]]. 

The city was founded in 1791, and the [6th Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_United_States_Congress "6th United States Congress") held the first session in the unfinished [Capitol Building](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol "United States Capitol") in 1800 after the capital moved from [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"). In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)") and [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia "Alexandria, Virginia"), was officially recognized as the federal district; initially, the city was a separate settlement within the larger district. In 1846, Congress reduced the size of the district when it [returned the land originally ceded by Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_retrocession "District of Columbia retrocession"), including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a [single municipality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Organic_Act_of_1871 "District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871") for the district. There have been several unsuccessful [efforts to make the district into a state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_statehood_movement "District of Columbia statehood movement") since the 1880s; a [statehood bill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.,_Admission_Act "Washington, D.C., Admission Act") passed the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") in 2021 but was not adopted by the [U.S. Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate"). To become law it would have to be passed by the Senate and signed by president; it would have renamed the city *Washington, Douglass Commonwealth* and shrunk the Federal District to about the size of the National Mall.

[Designed in 1791](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Enfant_Plan "L'Enfant Plan") by [Pierre Charles L'Enfant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant "Pierre Charles L'Enfant"), the city is divided into [quadrants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrants_of_Washington,_D.C. "Quadrants of Washington, D.C."), which are centered around the Capitol Building and include 131 [neighborhoods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Washington,_D.C. "Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C."). As of the [2020 census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census "2020 United States census"), the city had a population of 689,545.[^quickfacts-3] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[^u.s._department_of_commerce-12] The [Washington metropolitan area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area "Washington metropolitan area"), which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and [West Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia "West Virginia"), is the country's [seventh-largest metropolitan area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area "Metropolitan statistical area"), with a 2023 population of 6.3 million residents.[^metroest-6] [A locally elected mayor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_the_District_of_Columbia "Mayor of the District of Columbia") and [13-member council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia "Council of the District of Columbia") have governed the district since 1973, though Congress retains the power to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C. residents do not have voting representation in Congress, but elect a single [non-voting congressional delegate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-voting_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives "Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives") to the U.S. House of Representatives. The city's voters choose three [presidential electors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College "United States Electoral College") in accordance with the [Twenty-third Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution"), passed in 1961.

Washington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the [Northeast megalopolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_megalopolis "Northeast megalopolis"). As the seat of the [U.S. federal government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States"), the city is an important [world political capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caput_Mundi "Caput Mundi").[^13] The city hosts the buildings that house federal government headquarters, including the [White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House"), the Capitol, the [Supreme Court Building](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court_Building "United States Supreme Court Building"), and [multiple federal departments and agencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States "List of federal agencies in the United States"). The city is home to many national [monuments and museums](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_in_Washington,_D.C. "List of museums in Washington, D.C."), located most prominently on or around the [National Mall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall "National Mall"), including the [Jefferson Memorial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Memorial "Jefferson Memorial"), the [Lincoln Memorial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial "Lincoln Memorial"), and the [Washington Monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument "Washington Monument"). It hosts [177 foreign embassies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_Washington,_D.C. "List of diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C.") and serves as the headquarters for the [World Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), the [Organization of American States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States "Organization of American States"), and other international organizations. Home to many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and [think tanks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank "Think tank"), D.C. is known as a [lobbying](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States "Lobbying in the United States") hub, with [K Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Street_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "K Street (Washington, D.C.)") as the industry center.[^14] It is also among the country's top tourist destinations; in 2022, it drew an estimated 20.7 million domestic[^15] and 1.2 million international visitors, seventh-most among U.S. cities.[^16]

## History

The [Algonquian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_peoples "Algonquian peoples")\-speaking [Piscataway people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataway_people "Piscataway people"), also known as the Conoy, inhabited the lands around the [Potomac River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River") and present-day Washington, D.C., when Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. The [Nacotchtank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacotchtank "Nacotchtank"), also called the Nacostines by [Catholic missionaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_missions "Catholic missions"), maintained settlements around the [Anacostia River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacostia_River "Anacostia River") in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with [European colonists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas "European colonization of the Americas") and neighboring tribes ultimately displaced the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near [Point of Rocks, Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_Rocks,_Maryland "Point of Rocks, Maryland").[^17]

### Founding

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/USCapitol1800.jpg/220px-USCapitol1800.jpg)

The [United States Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") began assembling in the new [United States Capitol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol "United States Capitol") in 1800 after the nation's capital was moved from [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia").

[Nine cities served as capitals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States#National_capitals "List of capitals in the United States") to the [Continental Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress "Continental Congress") and under the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation "Articles of Confederation"). [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") was the first capital upon the adoption of the [Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States "Constitution of the United States"), succeeded by [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"), which was capital from 1790 to 1800.[^18]

On October 6, 1783, after the capital was forced by the [Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Mutiny_of_1783 "Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783") to move to Princeton, Congress resolved to consider a new location for it.[^jcc120-19] The following day, [Elbridge Gerry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbridge_Gerry "Elbridge Gerry") of Massachusetts moved "that buildings for the use of Congress be erected on the banks of the [Delaware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_River "Delaware River") near [Trenton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey "Trenton, New Jersey"), or of the [Potomac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"), near [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)"), provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid, for a federal town".[^jcc127-20]

In [Federalist No. 43](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._43 "Federalist No. 43"), published January 23, 1788, [James Madison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison "James Madison") argued that the new [federal government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.[^21] The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.[^22]

[Article One, Section Eight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress "Article One of the United States Constitution") of the Constitution permits the establishment of a "District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States".[^23] However, the constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In the [Compromise of 1790](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790 "Compromise of 1790"), Madison, [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton"), and [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining [Revolutionary War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War") debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the [Southern United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States").[^crew124-24][^25]

On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the [Residence Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_Act "Residence Act"), which approved the creation of a national capital on the [Potomac River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"). Under the Residence Act, the exact location was to be selected by President [George Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington"), who signed the bill into law on July 16, 1790. Formed from land donated by Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side and totaling 100 square miles (259 km<sup>2</sup>).[^crew89-26][^27]

Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory, the port of [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)"), founded in 1751,[^28] and the [port](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port "Port") city of [Alexandria, Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia "Alexandria, Virginia"), founded in 1749.[^29] In 1791 and 1792, a team led by [Andrew Ellicott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ellicott "Andrew Ellicott"), including Ellicott's brothers [Joseph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ellicott "Joseph Ellicott") and [Benjamin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Ellicott "Benjamin Ellicott") and African American [astronomer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") [Benjamin Banneker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Banneker "Benjamin Banneker"), whose parents had been enslaved, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed [boundary stones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_markers_of_the_original_District_of_Columbia "Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia") at every mile point; many of these stones are still standing.[^30][^31] Both Maryland and Virginia were [slave states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states "Slave states"), and [slavery existed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_District_of_Columbia "Slavery in the District of Columbia") in the District from its founding. The building of Washington likely relied in significant part on slave labor, and slave receipts have been found for the White House, Capitol Building, and establishment of Georgetown University. The city became an important [slave market](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_market "Slave market") and a center of the nation's [internal slave trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_trade_in_the_United_States "Slave trade in the United States").[^32][^33]

After its survey, the new [federal city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_city "Federal city") was constructed on the north bank of the Potomac River, to the east of Georgetown centered on [Capitol Hill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill "Capitol Hill"). On September 9, 1791, three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The same day, the federal district was named Columbia, a feminine form of [Columbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus"), which was [a poetic name for the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_\(personification\) "Columbia (personification)") commonly used at that time.[^34][^35] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.[^36]

Congress passed the [District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Organic_Act_of_1801 "District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801"), which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the [exclusive control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_home_rule "District of Columbia home rule") of the federal government. The area within the district was organized into two counties, the [County of Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_D.C. "Washington County, D.C.") to the east and north of the Potomac and the [County of Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_County,_D.C. "Alexandria County, D.C.") to the west and south.[^37] After the Act's passage, citizens in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which ended their representation in Congress.[^38]

### Burning during War of 1812

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/British_Burning_Washington.jpg/220px-British_Burning_Washington.jpg)

After their victory at the [Battle of Bladensburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bladensburg "Battle of Bladensburg") in 1814, the [British Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_American_Revolutionary_War "British Army during the American Revolutionary War") burned the [White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") and other buildings during a one-day occupation of Washington, D.C.

On August 24, 1814, during the [War of 1812](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 "War of 1812"), [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an American force [at Bladensburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bladensburg "Battle of Bladensburg"). In retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in [the Canadas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadas "The Canadas"), the British set fire to government buildings in the city, gutting the [United States Capitol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol "United States Capitol"), the [Treasury Building](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Building_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)"), and the [White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") in what became known as the [burning of Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Washington "Burning of Washington"). However, a storm forced the British to evacuate the city after just 24 hours.[^39] Most government buildings were repaired quickly, but the Capitol, which was largely under construction at the time, would not be completed in its current form until 1868.[^40]

### Retrocession and the Civil War

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/LincolnInauguration1861a.jpg/220px-LincolnInauguration1861a.jpg)

The [U.S. Capitol dome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_dome "United States Capitol dome") was under construction during [Lincoln's first inauguration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_first_inaugural_address "Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address") on March 4, 1861, five weeks before the start of the [American Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War").

In the 1830s, the district's southern territory of [Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia "Alexandria, Virginia") declined economically, due in part to its neglect by Congress.[^richards-41] Alexandria was a major market in the [domestic slave trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_trade_in_the_United_States "Slave trade in the United States") and pro-slavery residents feared that [abolitionists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States "Abolitionism in the United States") in Congress would end [slavery in the district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_District_of_Columbia "Slavery in the District of Columbia"). Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to retake the land it had donated to form the district, a process known as [retrocession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_retrocession "District of Columbia retrocession").[^42]

The [Virginia General Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly "Virginia General Assembly") voted in February 1846, to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress went further, agreeing to return all territory that Virginia had ceded to the district during its formation. This left the district's area consisting only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.[^richards-41] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the [Compromise of 1850](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1850 "Compromise of 1850") outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.[^43]

The outbreak of the [American Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the city's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.[^dodd-44] President [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln") signed the [Compensated Emancipation Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensated_Emancipation_Act "Compensated Emancipation Act") in 1862, which ended slavery in the district, freeing about 3,100 slaves in the district nine months before the [Emancipation Proclamation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation "Emancipation Proclamation").[^emancipation-45] In 1868, Congress granted the district's [African American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American "African American") male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.[^dodd-44]

### Growth and redevelopment

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Army_Headquarters_in_Washington_-_State%2C_War%2C_and_Navy_Building%2C_c._1888_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Army_Headquarters_in_Washington_-_State%2C_War%2C_and_Navy_Building%2C_c._1888_%28cropped%29.jpg)

The [Eisenhower Executive Office Building](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Executive_Office_Building "Eisenhower Executive Office Building"), built between 1871 and 1888, was the world's largest office building until 1943, when it was surpassed by [The Pentagon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon "The Pentagon").

By 1870, the district's population had grown 75% in a decade to nearly 132,000 people,[^histpop-46] yet the city still lacked paved roads and basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but President [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant "Ulysses S. Grant") refused to consider the proposal.[^47]

In the [Organic Act of 1871](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Organic_Act_of_1871 "District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871"), Congress repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)"), abolished [Washington County](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_D.C. "Washington County, D.C."), and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia.[^48] These steps made "the city of Washington...legally indistinguishable from the District of Columbia."[^tikkanen-2023-49]

In 1873, President Grant appointed [Alexander Robey Shepherd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Robey_Shepherd "Alexander Robey Shepherd") as Governor of the District of Columbia. Shepherd authorized large projects that modernized the city but bankrupted its government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.[^50]

In 1888, the city's [first motorized streetcars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetcars_in_Washington,_D.C. "Streetcars in Washington, D.C.") began service. Their introduction generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries, leading to an expansion of the district over the next few decades.[^neighborhoods-51] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged with those of the City of Washington in 1895.[^tindall-52] However, the city had poor housing and strained public works, leading it to become the first city in the nation to undergo [urban renewal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal "Urban renewal") projects as part of the [City Beautiful movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Beautiful_movement "City Beautiful movement") in the early 20th century.[^ramroth-53]

The [City Beautiful](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Beautiful "City Beautiful") movement built heavily upon the already-implemented [L'Enfant Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Enfant_Plan "L'Enfant Plan"), with the new [McMillan Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan_Plan "McMillan Plan") leading urban development in the city throughout the movement. Much of the old [Victorian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_architecture "Victorian architecture") [Mall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall "National Mall") was replaced with modern [Neoclassical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture "Neoclassical architecture") and [Beaux-Arts architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaux-Arts_architecture "Beaux-Arts architecture"); these designs are still prevalent in the city's governmental buildings today.

Increased federal spending under the [New Deal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal "New Deal") in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district,[^54] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations, [Ross A. Collins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_A._Collins "Ross A. Collins") of [Mississippi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi "Mississippi"), justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents by saying that "my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers."[^55]

[World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") led to an expansion of federal employees in the city;[^56] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.[^histpop-46]

### Civil rights and home rule era

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/IhaveadreamMarines.jpg/220px-IhaveadreamMarines.jpg)

The [March on Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom") at the [Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial_Reflecting_Pool "Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool") on August 28, 1963

The [Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution") was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the [Electoral College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_\(United_States\) "Electoral College (United States)") for the election of president and vice president, but still not affording the city's residents representation in Congress.[^57]

After the [assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.") on April 4, 1968, [riots broke out in the city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Washington,_D.C.,_riots "1968 Washington, D.C., riots"), primarily in the U Street, 14th Street, 7th Street, and H Street corridors, which were predominantly black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and [Washington, D.C., Army National Guardsmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard "Army National Guard") stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned, and rebuilding from the riots was not completed until the late 1990s.[^58]

In 1973, Congress enacted the [District of Columbia Home Rule Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Home_Rule_Act "District of Columbia Home Rule Act") providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district.[^59] In 1975, [Walter Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Washington "Walter Washington") became the district's first elected and first black mayor.[^60]

### Statehood movement

Since the 1980s, the [D.C. statehood movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_statehood_movement "District of Columbia statehood movement") has grown in prominence. In 2016, a [referendum on D.C. statehood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Washington,_D.C.,_statehood_referendum "2016 Washington, D.C., statehood referendum") resulted in an 85% support among Washington, D.C., voters for it to become the nation's [51st state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_state "51st state"). In March 2017, the city's congressional delegate [Eleanor Holmes Norton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Holmes_Norton "Eleanor Holmes Norton") introduced a bill for statehood. Reintroduced in 2019 and 2021 as the [Washington, D.C., Admission Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.,_Admission_Act "Washington, D.C., Admission Act"), the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") passed it in April 2021.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> After not progressing in the Senate, the statehood bill was introduced again in January 2023.[^61] The bill would have made D.C. into a state with one representative and two senators, with the name Washington, Douglass Commonwealth (thus keeping the same abbreviation Washington, D.C.).[^62] The legalities, reasons, and impact of statehood have been heavily debated in the 2020s.[^sthd101-63]

Washington, D.C. is located on the north side of the [Potomac River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"). It is bordered on three sides by [Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland "Maryland") and by [Northern Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia "Northern Virginia") to its southwest.

Washington, D.C., is located in the [Mid-Atlantic region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_\(United_States\) "Mid-Atlantic (United States)") of the [U.S. East Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States "East Coast of the United States"). The city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km<sup>2</sup>), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km<sup>2</sup>) (10.67%) is water.[^64] The district is bordered by [Montgomery County, Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland "Montgomery County, Maryland"), to the northwest; [Prince George's County, Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George%27s_County,_Maryland "Prince George's County, Maryland"), to the east; [Arlington County, Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia "Arlington County, Virginia"), to the west; and [Alexandria, Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia "Alexandria, Virginia"), to the south.

The south bank of the [Potomac River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River") forms the district's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries, the [Anacostia River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacostia_River "Anacostia River") and [Rock Creek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Creek_\(Potomac_River_tributary\) "Rock Creek (Potomac River tributary)").[^65] [Tiber Creek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber_Creek "Tiber Creek"), a natural watercourse that once passed through the [National Mall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall "National Mall"), was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.[^66] The creek also formed a portion of the now-filled [Washington City Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_City_Canal "Washington City Canal"), which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s.[^67] The [Chesapeake and Ohio Canal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Canal "Chesapeake and Ohio Canal") starts in [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)") and was used during the 19th century to bypass the [Little Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Falls_\(Potomac_River\) "Little Falls (Potomac River)") of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of the city at the [Atlantic Seaboard fall line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_fall_line "Atlantic Seaboard fall line").[^68]

The highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125 m) [above sea level](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level "Above mean sea level") at [Fort Reno Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Reno_Park "Fort Reno Park") in upper [northwest Washington, D.C.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Northwest (Washington, D.C.)")[^69] The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River.[^70] The geographic center of Washington is near the intersection of 4th and L streets NW.[^71][^72][^legend-73]

The district has 7,464 acres (30.21 km<sup>2</sup>) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area, the second-highest among high-density U.S. cities after [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia").[^74] The city's sizable parkland was a factor in the city being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the park systems of the nation's 100 most populous cities, according to [Trust for Public Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_for_Public_Land "Trust for Public Land"), a non-profit organization.[^75]

The [National Park Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service "National Park Service") manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92 km<sup>2</sup>) of city land owned by the U.S. government.[^76] Rock Creek Park is a 1,754-acre (7.10 km<sup>2</sup>) urban forest in Northwest Washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0 km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. Established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes.[^77] Other National Park Service properties include the [Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Canal_National_Historical_Park "Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park"), the [National Mall and Memorial Parks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall_and_Memorial_Parks "National Mall and Memorial Parks"), [Theodore Roosevelt Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_Island "Theodore Roosevelt Island"), [Columbia Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Island_\(District_of_Columbia\) "Columbia Island (District of Columbia)"), [Fort Dupont Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Dupont_Park "Fort Dupont Park"), [Meridian Hill Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_Hill_Park "Meridian Hill Park"), [Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenilworth_Park_and_Aquatic_Gardens "Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens"), and [Anacostia Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacostia_Park "Anacostia Park").[^78] The [District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Department_of_Parks_and_Recreation "District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation") maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6 km<sup>2</sup>) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers.[^79] The [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture "United States Department of Agriculture") operates the 446-acre (1.80 km<sup>2</sup>) [United States National Arboretum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Arboretum "United States National Arboretum") in [Northeast Washington, D.C.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Northeast (Washington, D.C.)")[^80]

### Climate

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Flickr_-_USCapitol_-_February_2010_Blizzard.jpg/220px-Flickr_-_USCapitol_-_February_2010_Blizzard.jpg)

The [U.S. Capitol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol "United States Capitol") during the [February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_5%E2%80%936,_2010_North_American_blizzard "February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard")

Washington's climate is [humid subtropical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate "Humid subtropical climate") ([Köppen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification"): *Cfa*), or [oceanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate "Oceanic climate") ([Trewartha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trewartha_climate_classification "Trewartha climate classification"): *Do* bordering *Cf* downtown).[^81][^82] Winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant [hardiness zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone "Hardiness zone") 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.[^83][^wapo_temps-84]

Summers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8 °F (26.6 °C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100 °F (38 °C) at the height of summer.[^85] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.[^86]

Blizzards affect Washington once every four to six years on average. The most violent storms, known as [nor'easters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nor%27easter "Nor'easter"), often impact large regions of the [East Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States "East Coast of the United States").[^dcwinter-87] From [January 27 to 28, 1922](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knickerbocker_storm "Knickerbocker storm"), the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.[^88] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.[^doc-89]

Hurricanes or their remnants occasionally impact the area in late summer and early fall. However, they usually are weak by the time they reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location.[^90] Flooding of the [Potomac River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"), however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_\(Washington,_D.C.\) "Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)") neighborhood of the city.[^91] Precipitation occurs throughout the year.[^wmo_1961%e2%80%9390_kdca-92]

The highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 6, 1918, and on July 20, 1930.[^samenow-93] The lowest recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) on [February 11, 1899](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blizzard_of_1899#Arctic_cold "Great Blizzard of 1899"), right before the [Great Blizzard of 1899](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blizzard_of_1899 "Great Blizzard of 1899").[^dcwinter-87] During a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90 °F (32 °C) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32 °F or 0 °C). On average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is November 18 and the last day is March 27.[^95][^96]
