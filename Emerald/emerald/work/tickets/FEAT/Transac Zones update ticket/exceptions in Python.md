  Exceptions in Python!

  In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a
  program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions can be
  errors, such as syntax errors or runtime errors, or they can be intentional,
  such as when a program needs to Signal an error or unusual condition.

  Here's a comprehensive overview of exceptions in Python:

  Types of Exceptions

  1. SyntaxError: Raised when there is an error in the syntax of the Python
  code.
  2. IndentationError: Raised when there is an error in the indentation of the
  Python code.
  3. TypeError: Raised when a operation is applied to an object of an
  incorrect type.
  4. ValueError: Raised when a function or operation receives an argument with
  an incorrect value.
  5. RuntimeError: Raised when an error occurs during the execution of a
  program.
  6. Exception: The base class for all exceptions.

  Raising Exceptions

  In Python, you can raise an exception using the  raise  statement. For
  example:

    raise ValueError("Invalid input")

  Catching Exceptions

  You can catch exceptions using a  try - except  block. The  try  block
  contains the code that might raise an exception, and the  except  block
  contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised.

    try:
        x = 5 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: cannot divide by zero!")

  In this example, the  try  block attempts to divide 5 by 0, which raises a
  ZeroDivisionError  exception. The  except  block catches the exception and
  prints an error message.

  Try-Except-Finally

  You can also use a  try - except - finally  block, which allows you to execute
  code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

    try:
        x = 5 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: cannot divide by zero!")
    finally:
        print("This code will always run")

  Custom Exceptions

  You can define your own custom exceptions by creating a class that inherits
  from the  Exception  class.

```python
    class MyCustomException(Exception):
        pass

    raise MyCustomException("Something went wrong!")
```
  
##  Best Practices

  1. Use meaningful exception messages: When raising an exception, provide a
  meaningful message that helps the user understand what went wrong.
  2. Catch specific exceptions: Instead of catching the general  Exception
  class, catch specific exceptions to handle them differently.
  3. Use try-finally for resource management: Use  try - finally  blocks to
  ensure that resources, such as files or connections, are closed regardless
  of whether an exception was raised or not.

# examples

  Example 1: Handling multiple exceptions

```python
    try:
        x = 5 / 0
        y = "hello" + 5
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: cannot divide by zero!")
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: cannot concatenate string and integer!")
```

  In this example, we're trying to perform two operations that might raise
  different exceptions: dividing by zero ( ZeroDivisionError ) and
  concatenating a string and an integer ( TypeError ). We catch both
  exceptions separately and print an error message for each.

  Example 2: Raising a custom exception

    class InvalidUsernameException(Exception):
        pass

    def validate_username(username):
        if len(username) < 3:
            raise InvalidUsernameException("Username must be at least 3
  characters long")
        return True

    try:
        validate_username("ab")
    except InvalidUsernameException as e:
        print(e)  # Output: Username must be at least 3 characters long

  In this example, we define a custom exception class
  InvalidUsernameException  and raise it in a  validate_username  function
  when the username is too short. We catch the exception and print the error
  message.

  Example 3: Using try-except-finally

    try:
        file = open("example.txt", "r")
        data = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: file not found!")
    finally:
        if file:
            file.close()

  In this example, we try to open a file and read its contents. If the file
  doesn't exist, a  FileNotFoundError  exception is raised. We catch the
  exception and print an error message. The  finally  block is executed
  regardless of whether an exception was raised or not, and we close the file
  if it was opened successfully.

  Example 4: Handling exceptions in a loop

    while True:
        try:
            user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
            num = int(user_input)
            break
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: invalid input! Please enter a number.")

  In this example, we're trying to convert user input to an integer in a loop.
  If the input is not a valid integer, a  ValueError  exception is raised. We
  catch the exception and print an error message, and then continue to the
  next iteration of the loop.

  Example 5: Using assert to raise an exception

    def divide(a, b):
        assert b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero!"
        return a / b

    try:
        result = divide(10, 0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)  # Output: Cannot divide by zero!

  In this example, we use an  assert  statement to raise an exception if the
  divisor is zero. The  assert  statement is equivalent to  if not condition:
  raise AssertionError(message) . We catch the  AssertionError  exception and
  print the error message.

  Example 6:Logging exceptions

    import logging

    try:
        x = 5 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        logging.error("Error: cannot divide by zero!", exc_info=True)

  In this example, we catch a  ZeroDivisionError  exception and log it using
  the  logging  module. The  exc_info=True  argument includes the exception
  information in the log message.
