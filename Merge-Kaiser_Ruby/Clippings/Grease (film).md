A sequel, *[Grease 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_2 "Grease 2")*, was released in 1982, starring [Maxwell Caulfield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Caulfield "Maxwell Caulfield") and [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer "Michelle Pfeiffer") as a newer class of greasers.

In the summer of 1958, local boy Danny Zuko and vacationing Australian Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love. When the summer comes to an end, Sandy frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is "only the beginning".

At the start of the seniors' term at Rydell High School, Danny resumes his role as leader of the T-Birds [greaser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greaser_\(subculture\) "Greaser (subculture)") gang consisting of Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and his best friend Kenickie. Sandy's parents remain in America and enroll Sandy at Rydell where she meets greaser girl clique the Pink Ladies consisting of Frenchy, Marty, Jan and leader Rizzo.

Danny and Sandy recount their brief romance to their groups, Sandy recalling a romantic summer and Danny implying a more physical experience. When Sandy finally says Danny's name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion at a [pep rally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_rally "Pep rally") where Sandy meets Tom, a [jock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_\(stereotype\) "Jock (stereotype)"), and Kenickie unveils his new used car, Greased Lightnin', which he plans on [street racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_racing "Street racing") after a restoration. Caught between his feelings and his bad-boy reputation, Danny snubs Sandy in front of his gang and she becomes upset.

At a Pink Ladies pajama party, Sandy falls ill from drinking, trying a cigarette, and having her ears pierced by Frenchy. Rizzo, after mocking Sandy's wholesome and chaste personality, departs for sex with Kenickie in his car—they do not use a condom as Kenickie discovers that the one he bought in the seventh grade has broken. They are disturbed by Leo, leader of the rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha. After the slumber party comes to an end, Sandy realizes she still loves Danny after all.

The next day, Danny apologizes to Sandy for having brushed her off the previous night and, with Coach Calhoun's help, becomes a runner and successfully wins her back from Tom. However, their friends crash their date, and Kenickie and Rizzo break up after an argument. After a disastrous beauty class leaves Frenchy with candy-pink hair, she drops out of beauty school and reluctantly returns to Rydell to complete her high-school education.

During the school dance, broadcast live on *[National Bandstand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bandstand "American Bandstand")* and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, Rizzo and Kenickie spite each other by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. In a chaotic [hand jive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_jive "Hand jive") contest, Danny and Sandy dance well, but just before the winners are announced, Sonny pulls Sandy away and Cha-Cha cuts in to win with Danny, as Sandy storms out.

Danny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater, but a more direct and pushy advance causes Sandy to flee in horror. Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, who tells Sonny, who inadvertently spreads the rumor to the apparent father Kenickie, though Rizzo denies it to him.

On race day, Kenickie is struck in the head by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel, winning the race after Leo spins out. Sandy, watching from afar and rejoicing for Danny's victory, concludes she still loves him and enlists Frenchy's help in changing her attitude and looks to impress him.

On the last day of school, Rizzo finds she is not pregnant and reunites with Kenickie. At a carnival, Danny and Sandy each find they have changed for each other: Danny has become a [letterman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterman_\(sports\) "Letterman (sports)"), and Sandy a greaser girl. The two depart in the Greased Lightnin' car, which takes flight into the sky.

*Grease* is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978.[^49][^50][^51] [Metacritic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), which uses a [weighted average](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean "Weighted arithmetic mean"), assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[^metacritic1-52] On [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), the film holds a 66% approval rating based on 156 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Word is, *Grease* stars an electrifying John Travolta while serving up some '50s kitsch in a frenetic adaptation that isn't always the one that we want."[^53]

First reviews were mixed. [^54] *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")*' [Vincent Canby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Canby "Vincent Canby") called the film "terrific fun", describing it as a "contemporary fantasy about a 1950s teen-age musical—a larger, funnier, wittier and more imaginative-than-Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own". Canby compared *Grease* to *[Don't Knock the Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Knock_the_Rock "Don't Knock the Rock")* (1956) and *[Beach Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Party "Beach Party")* (1963), calling it a "multimillion-dollar evocation" of these "B-picture quickies".[^55] [Gene Siskel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel "Gene Siskel") gave the film three stars out of four, calling it "exciting only when John Travolta is on the screen" but still recommending it to viewers, adding, "Four of its musical numbers are genuine showstoppers that should bring applause."[^56] *[Variety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(magazine\) "Variety (magazine)")* praised the "zesty choreography and very excellent new plus revived music", and thought Travolta and Newton-John "play together quite well."[^57]

[Charles Champlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Champlin "Charles Champlin") of the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")* was negative, writing, "I didn't see *Grease* onstage, but on the testimony of this strident, cluttered, uninvolving and unattractive movie, it is the '50s—maybe the last innocent decade allowed to us—played back through a grotesquely distorting '70s consciousness."[^58] Gary Arnold of *[The Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")* also panned the film, writing, "Despite the obvious attempts to recall bits from [Stanley Donen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Donen "Stanley Donen") musicals or [Elvis Presley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley "Elvis Presley") musicals or [Frankie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Avalon "Frankie Avalon")\-and-[Annette](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Funicello "Annette Funicello") musicals, the spirit is closer to the New Tastelessness exemplified by [Ken Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Russell "Ken Russell"), minus Russell's slick visual style \[...\] I've never seen an uglier large-scale musical."[^59] [David Ansen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ansen "David Ansen") of *[Newsweek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek "Newsweek")* wrote, "Too often, *Grease* is simply mediocre, full of broad high-school humor, flat dramatic scenes and lethargic pacing. Fortunately, there's nothing flat about John Travolta \[...\] when he's on screen you can't watch anyone else."[^60]

In a 1998 retrospective review, [Roger Ebert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert") gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it "an average musical, pleasant and upbeat and plastic." He found John Travolta's Elvis Presley–inspired performance to be the highlight, but felt that *Grease* "sees the material as silly [camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_\(style\) "Camp (style)")."[^61] In 2018, [Peter Bradshaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bradshaw "Peter Bradshaw") from *[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")* gave it 5 out of 5 stars, saying "It's still a sugar-rush of a film."[^62] *Grease* was voted the best musical ever on [Channel 4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4 "Channel 4")'s 100 greatest musicals in 2004.[^63] The film was ranked number 21 on *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")*'s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.[^64][^65]

In recent years, the film has been reassessed for what some critics have deemed as discriminatory and problematic content.[^:0-66] Bryn Gelbart from *[Business Insider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider "Business Insider")* wrote that the film had not aged well, describing it as preaching an "unfortunate message" with aspects that could be "considered regressive by today's standards".[^67] Kristen Baldwin of *[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")* wrote that the ending of the film was "decidedly un-[feminist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism "Feminism")".[^68] Katy Hall of *[The Sydney Morning Herald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald "The Sydney Morning Herald")* said that the film was "deeply problematic" but also "ahead of its time."[^:0-66] Joe Hildebrand of [News.com.au](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/News.com.au "News.com.au") defended the film, saying that it "isn’t horribly sexist and offensive, it’s just that its characters say and do horrible, sexist and offensive things \[...\] In short, they’re a lot like, well, people."[^69] A 2020 showing of film on the [BBC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") drew complaints from viewers and renewed criticism.[^70] Olivia Newton-John responded to the criticism, calling the comments "silly" and saying that the film isn't meant "to be taken so seriously."[^71]
