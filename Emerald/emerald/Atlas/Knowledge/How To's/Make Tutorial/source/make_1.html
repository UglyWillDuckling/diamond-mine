<P>
The <CODE>make</CODE> utility automatically determines which pieces of a large
program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
This manual describes GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, which was implemented by Richard
Stallman and Roland McGrath.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> conforms to section 6.2 of
<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE> (POSIX.2).

<P>
Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use
<CODE>make</CODE> with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a
shell command.  Indeed, <CODE>make</CODE> is not limited to programs.  You can
use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically
from others whenever the others change.
<P>
To prepare to use <CODE>make</CODE>, you must write a file called
the <DFN>makefile</DFN> that describes the relationships among files
in your program and provides commands for updating each file.
In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object
files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.<P>
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:
<P>
<PRE>
make
</PRE>
<P>
suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <CODE>make</CODE> program
uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to
decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those files, it
issues the commands recorded in the data base.
<P>
You can provide command line arguments to <CODE>make</CODE> to control which
files should be recompiled, or how.  See section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC78">How to Run <CODE>make</CODE></A>}.

<P>
If you are new to <CODE>make</CODE>, or are looking for a general
introduction, read the first few sections of each chapter, skipping the
later sections.  In each chapter, the first few sections contain
introductory or general information and the later sections contain
specialized or technical information.
The exception is section <A HREF="make_2.html#SEC4">An Introduction to Makefiles</A>,
all of which is introductory.
<P>
If you are familiar with other <CODE>make</CODE> programs, see section <A HREF="make_12.html#SEC107">Features of GNU <CODE>make</CODE></A>}, which lists the enhancements GNU
<CODE>make</CODE> has, and section <A HREF="make_13.html#SEC108">Incompatibilities and Missing Features</A>, which explains the few things GNU <CODE>make</CODE> lacks that
others have.
<P>
For a quick summary, see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC85">Summary of Options</A>, section <A HREF="make_15.html#SEC115">Quick Reference</A>,

<P>
If you have problems with GNU <CODE>make</CODE> or think you've found a bug,
please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything but
we might well want to fix it.
<P>
Before reporting a bug, make sure you've actually found a real bug.
Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
what you're trying to do.  If it's not clear whether you should be able
to do something or not, report that too; it's a bug in the
documentation!
<P>
Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible makefile that reproduces the problem.  Then
send us the makefile and the exact results <CODE>make</CODE> gave you.  Also
say what you expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the
problem was really in the documentation.
<P>
Once you've got a precise problem, please send electronic mail either
through the Internet or via UUCP:
<P>
<PRE>
Internet address:
    bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu

UUCP path:
    mit-eddie!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-utils
</PRE>
<P>
Please include the version number of <CODE>make</CODE> you are using.  You can
get this information with the command <SAMP>`make --version'</SAMP>.
Be sure also to include the type of machine and operating system you are
using.  If possible, include the contents of the file <TT>`config.h'</TT>
that is generated by the configuration process.
<P>
Non-bug suggestions are always welcome as well.  If you have questions
about things that are unclear in the documentation or are just obscure
features, send a message to the bug reporting address.  We cannot
guarantee you'll get help with your problem, but many seasoned
<CODE>make</CODE> users read the mailing list and they will probably try to
help you out.  The maintainers sometimes answer such questions as well,
when time permits.
