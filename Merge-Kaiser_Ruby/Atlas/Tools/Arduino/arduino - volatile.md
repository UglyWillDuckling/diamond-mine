  In Arduino, the  volatile  keyword is used to declare a variable that is
  supposed to be accessed or modified by an interrupt service routine (ISR) or
  another asynchronous event.

  When a variable is declared as  volatile , it tells the compiler that the
  variable's value can change unexpectedly, and therefore, the compiler should not
  optimize away the variable's reads or writes.

  Here's an example:

    volatile int count = 0;
    void setup() {
      // ...
    }
    void loop() {
      // ...
    }
    ISR(TIMER_vect) {
      count++; // increment the count variable in the ISR
    }

  In this example, the  count  variable is declared as  volatile  because it is modified within an interrupt service routine (ISR). If we didn't declare it as volatile , the compiler might optimize away the read or write operation on
  count` in the ISR, leading to unexpected behavior.

  Now, about the **default value** of a  volatile  variable in Arduino.

  When you declare a  volatile  variable, it is initialized with a default value,
  just like any other variable.

  Here's the default values for different types of variables in Arduino:

  •  int : 0
  •  char : 0 (or '\0' if it's a string)
  •  long : 0L (e.g., 0L or 0UL for unsigned long)
  •  double : 0.0 (for floating-point numbers)

  So, in the example above, the  count  variable is initialized with a default value of 0.
