## intro

- high level estimates

## issues with this approach

- ! I find the way the work get's split up and structured missleading as it expects the implementation to match the desired outcome
	- ' this is simply not the case
	- $ I would say that here we are dealing with the difference between [[interface]] and [[implementation]]
		- we should be estimating the [[implementation]] not the [[interface]]
	- All this results in the final structure(list) missing the really **important** stuff, essentially the things that will form the foundation(basis) of the entire [[Real Estate Project]](`endeavour`)
