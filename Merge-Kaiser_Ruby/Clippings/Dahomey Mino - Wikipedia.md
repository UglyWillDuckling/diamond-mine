The **Dahomey Amazons** ([Fon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_language "Fon language"): **Agojie**, **Agoji**, **Mino**, or **Minon**) were a [Fon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_people "Fon people") all-female military regiment of the [Kingdom of Dahomey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Dahomey "Kingdom of Dahomey") (in today's [Benin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin "Benin"), West Africa) that existed from the 17th century until the late 19th century. They were the only female army in modern history.[^1] They were named Amazons by Western Europeans who encountered them, due to the story of the female warriors of [Amazons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons "Amazons") in [Greek mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology").

The Dahomey Mino around 1890

The emergence of an all-female military regiment was the result of Dahomey's male population facing high casualties in the increasingly frequent violence and warfare with neighbouring [West African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa") states. This led to Dahomey being one of the leading states in the [slave trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade "Atlantic slave trade") with the [Oyo Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyo_Empire "Oyo Empire"), which used slaves for commodity exchange in West Africa until the slave trade in the region ended. The lack of men likely led the [kings of Dahomey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Dahomey "King of Dahomey") to recruit women into the army. The formation of a female-only army unit was a retaliation and maneuver around the forced tribute of male slaves to Oyo each year.[^:0-2]

King [Houegbadja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houegbadja "Houegbadja") (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of Dahomey, is said to have originally started the group which would later become the *Mino* as a corps of elephant hunters called the *gbeto*.[^footnotealpern1998b20-3] The *gbeto* may even predate Houegbadja, as there is a tradition where he merely organized pre-existing groups into a corps, and another were the *gbeto* themselves offered to serve the king.[^4]

Houegbadja's daughter Queen [Hangbe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangbe "Hangbe") (ruling from 1716 to 1718) established a female bodyguard. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, her brother and successor King [Agaja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaja "Agaja") successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of [Savi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savi "Savi") in 1727.[^footnotelaw1993-5] The group of female warriors was referred to as *Mino*, meaning "Our Mothers" in the [Fon language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_language "Fon language"), by the male army of Dahomey.[^footnotealpern1998b44-6] Other sources contest the claim that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, some even going so far as to question whether or not Queen Hangbe actually existed.[^7]

From the time of King [Ghezo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghezo "Ghezo") (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as "Amazons", they called themselves *ahosi* (king's wives) or *Mino* (our mothers).[^footnotelaw1993-5]

Ghezo recruited both men and women as soldiers from foreign captives. Female soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, with some enrolled from as young as eight years of age.[^footnotelaw1993-5] Other accounts indicate that the *Mino* were recruited from among the *ahosi* ("king's wives"), of which there were often hundreds.[^footnotealpern1998b38-8] Some women in [Fon society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_people "Fon people") became soldiers voluntarily, while others were [involuntarily enrolled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behaviour.[^9]

Membership among the *Mino* was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the Fon belief in [Vodun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodun "Vodun"). Oral Dahomean tradition holds that, upon recruitment, the Amazons were subjected to [female genital mutilation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation "Female genital mutilation").[^10]

The *Mino* trained with intense physical exercise. They learned survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming [acacia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia "Acacia")\-thorn defences in [military exercises](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercises "Military exercises") and executing prisoners.[^footnotedash2011-11] Discipline was emphasised.

Serving in the *Mino* offered women the opportunity to "rise to positions of command and influence" in an environment structured for individual empowerment.[^footnotelaw1993-5] The *Mino* were also wealthy and held high status.[^footnotedash2011-11]

The *Mino* took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), the majority of *Mino* generally supported peace with the [Egba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egba_people "Egba people") of [Abeokuta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeokuta "Abeokuta") arguing instead to raid smaller, less defended tribes. This set them at odds with their male military colleagues, who supported a full-on assault of Abeokuta. Civilian council members who allied with the Agojie also advocated for stronger commercial relations with Britain, favouring the trade of [palm oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil "Palm oil") above that of slaves.[^footnoteyoder1974-12]

Apart from the council, the [Annual Customs of Dahomey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Customs_of_Dahomey "Annual Customs of Dahomey") included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs consisted of a mock battle in which the Agojie attacked a "fort" and "captured" the slaves within,[^footnoteyoder1974-12] a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.[^footnotedash2011-11]

## Combat and structure

Dahomey Amazons with the king at their head, going to war – 1793

The women soldiers were rigorously trained in pain, endurance and speed. Once training was completed they were given uniforms.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. The reports also noted that the women soldiers were consistently judged to be superior to the male soldiers in effectiveness and bravery in battle.[^footnotelaw1993-5]

The women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a centre wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a *mino* counterpart.[^footnotelaw1993-5] In one mid-19th-century account by an English observer, it was documented that the women who had three stripes of [whitewash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewash "Whitewash") around each leg were honoured with marks of distinction.[^13]

The women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.[^:0-2]

In the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with [Winchester rifles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_rifle "Winchester rifle"), clubs and knives. Units were under female command. An 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant: "\[a\]s the [blacksmith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith "Blacksmith") takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men."[^14]

### Conflict with neighbouring kingdoms

The Agojie battles consisted mainly within Africa against various kingdoms and tribes. During that time period it was customary that once an enemy was defeated they would be killed or enslaved. Many African tribes participated in this and Dahomey was no exception. They would often enslave their enemies and sell them to European slave traders in exchange for weaponry for battle. As early as 1728, under the direction of King Agaja, the Dahomean army conquered the kingdoms of Whydah, and Popos. In 1840, they helped to capture the fortress of the Mahee at Attahapahms. However, it was at the hands of their long-standing enemy Abeokuta that they suffered crushing defeat, resulting in many casualties.

## Conflict with France

### First Franco-Dahomean War

The European encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King [Béhanzin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9hanzin "Béhanzin") started fighting French forces in the course of the [First Franco-Dahomean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Franco-Dahomean_War "First Franco-Dahomean War"). European observers noted that the women "handled admirably" in hand-to-hand combat, but fired their flintlocks from the hip rather than firing from the shoulder.[^footnotedash2011-11]

The *Mino* participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahomeans (including many *Mino*) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. The *Mino* were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down. Reportedly, 129 Dahomey fighters were killed in melee combat within the French lines.[^footnotealpern1998b195-15]

### Second Franco-Dahomean War

By the end of the [Second Franco-Dahomean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Franco-Dahomean_War "Second Franco-Dahomean War"), special units of the *Mino* were being assigned specifically to target French officers.[^footnotealpern1998b205-16] After several battles, the French prevailed in the Second Franco-Dahomean War and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. French soldiers, particularly of the [French Foreign Legion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion "French Foreign Legion"), were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about their "incredible courage and audacity" in combat.[^footnoteyoder1974-12]

Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey *Mino* could not prevail.[^footnoteyoder1974-12] During a battle with French soldiers at [Adegon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Franco-Dahomean_War#Battle_of_Ad%C3%A9gon "Second Franco-Dahomean War") on October 6, 1892, during the second war, the bulk of the Mino corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge.[^17] The Dahomey lost 86 regulars and 417 Dahomey Mino, with nearly all of those deaths being inflicted by bayonets; the French lost six soldiers.[^18]
