After installing the Chronos Timeline plugin for Obsidian, copy and paste this whole markdown file into a file in your vault to play around and learn the syntax.

Hover on a timeline and click the Edit button in the upper right to play with the data.

## Date formats

Chronos can visualize dates from the year down to the second level, using the syntax `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`.

The only required component of a date is the year (`YYYY`). Beyond that, you can specify additional time granularity as needed for your use case.

If not explicitly provided:

- The month and day default to `01` (January and the 1st)
- The hour, minute, and second default to `00` (top of the hour or minute)

### Examples

```chronos
- [2020] A year
- [2020-02] A month
- [2020-02-28] A day
- [2020-02-28T12] An hour
