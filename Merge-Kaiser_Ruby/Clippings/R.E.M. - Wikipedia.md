**R.E.M.** was an American [alternative rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock "Alternative rock") band formed in [Athens, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia "Athens, Georgia"), in 1980 by drummer [Bill Berry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Berry "Bill Berry"), guitarist [Peter Buck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buck "Peter Buck"), bassist [Mike Mills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mills "Mike Mills"), and lead vocalist [Michael Stipe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stipe "Michael Stipe"), who were students at the [University of Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia "University of Georgia"). R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [arpeggiated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggiated "Arpeggiated") guitar playing, Stipe's distinctive vocal style, unique stage presence and cryptic lyrics, Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as [Nirvana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_\(band\) "Nirvana (band)"), [Pixies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_\(band\) "Pixies (band)") and [Pavement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavement_\(band\) "Pavement (band)") named R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left in 1997 due to severe health issues, the remaining members continued with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011, having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the [world's best-selling music acts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists "List of best-selling music artists").

The band released their first single, " [Radio Free Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe_\(song\) "Radio Free Europe (song)") ", in 1981 on the independent record label [Hib-Tone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hib-Tone "Hib-Tone"). It was followed by the *[Chronic Town](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_Town "Chronic Town")* [EP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play "Extended play") in 1982, their first release on [I.R.S. Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.R.S._Records "I.R.S. Records"). Over the course of the decade, R.E.M. released acclaimed albums, commencing with their debut *[Murmur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmur_\(album\) "Murmur (album)")* (1983), and continuing yearly with *[Reckoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckoning_\(R.E.M._album\) "Reckoning (R.E.M. album)")* (1984), *[Fables of the Reconstruction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_of_the_Reconstruction "Fables of the Reconstruction")* (1985), *[Lifes Rich Pageant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifes_Rich_Pageant "Lifes Rich Pageant")* (1986), *[Document](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_\(album\) "Document (album)")* (1987) and *[Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_\(R.E.M._album\) "Green (R.E.M. album)")* (1988). During their most successful period, they worked with the producer [Scott Litt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Litt "Scott Litt"). With constant touring, and the support of [college radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_radio "Campus radio") following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single " [The One I Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_I_Love_\(R.E.M._song\) "The One I Love (R.E.M. song)") ". They signed to [Warner Bros. Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records "Warner Bros. Records") in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing arenas worldwide.

R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, *[Out of Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Time_\(album\) "Out of Time (album)")* (1991) and *[Automatic for the People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_for_the_People "Automatic for the People")* (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock at the time. *Out of Time* received seven nominations at the [34th Annual Grammy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Annual_Grammy_Awards "34th Annual Grammy Awards"), and the lead single, " [Losing My Religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_My_Religion "Losing My Religion") ", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. *[Monster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_\(R.E.M._album\) "Monster (R.E.M. album)")* (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time [the most expensive recording contract ever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_music_deals "List of largest music deals"). The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, *[New Adventures in Hi-Fi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Adventures_in_Hi-Fi "New Adventures in Hi-Fi")* (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year for health reasons, and Stipe, Buck and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as the multi-instrumentalists [Scott McCaughey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McCaughey "Scott McCaughey") and [Ken Stringfellow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Stringfellow "Ken Stringfellow") and the drummers [Joey Waronker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Waronker "Joey Waronker") and [Bill Rieflin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Rieflin "Bill Rieflin"). They also parted ways with their longtime manager [Jefferson Holt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Holt "Jefferson Holt"), at which point the band's attorney [Bertis Downs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertis_Downs "Bertis Downs") assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Litt, and hired as co-producer [Pat McCarthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McCarthy_\(record_producer\) "Pat McCarthy (record producer)"), who had worked as mixer and engineer on the band's previous two albums.

After the [electronic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") and [experimental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music "Experimental music") direction of *[Up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_\(R.E.M._album\) "Up (R.E.M. album)")* (1998), which was commercially unsuccessful, *[Reveal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reveal_\(R.E.M._album\) "Reveal (R.E.M. album)")* (2001), referred to as "a conscious return to their classic sound",[^4] received general acclaim.

In 2007, the band was inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame") in their first year of eligibility. Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony, and to record a cover of [John Lennon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon "John Lennon") 's " [#9 Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_9_Dream "Number 9 Dream") " for the 2007 compilation album *[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Karma:_The_Amnesty_International_Campaign_to_Save_Darfur "Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur")* to benefit [Amnesty International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") 's campaign to alleviate the [Darfur conflict](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_conflict "Darfur conflict"). Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for *[Around the Sun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_Sun "Around the Sun")* (2004), the band collaborated with the producer [Jacknife Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacknife_Lee "Jacknife Lee") on their final two studio albums—the well-received *[Accelerate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerate_\(R.E.M._album\) "Accelerate (R.E.M. album)")* (2008) and *[Collapse into Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_into_Now "Collapse into Now")* (2011). In 2024, the band reunited to perform "Losing My Religion" at their induction into the [Songwriters Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame "Songwriters Hall of Fame") and once again in 2025 to perform " [Pretty Persuasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Persuasion_\(song\) "Pretty Persuasion (song)") " at the [40 Watt Club](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/40_Watt_Club "40 Watt Club") in Athens, Georgia.[^5] [^6] [^7] [^8]

The steeple of [St. Mary's Episcopal Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Episcopal_Church_\(Athens,_Georgia\) "St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Athens, Georgia)") in 2015; this is all that remains of where members of R.E.M. lived briefly and performed their first concert on April 5, 1980.

In January 1980, [Peter Buck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buck "Peter Buck") met [Michael Stipe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stipe "Michael Stipe") in [Wuxtry Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxtry_Records "Wuxtry Records"), the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in [punk rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock "Punk rock") and [proto-punk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-punk "Proto-punk") artists like [Patti Smith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith "Patti Smith"), [Television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_\(band\) "Television (band)"), and [the Velvet Underground](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground "The Velvet Underground"). Stipe said, "It turns out that I was buying all the records that \[Buck\] was saving for himself." [^9] Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien,[^10] Stipe and Buck then met fellow [University of Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia "University of Georgia") students [Bill Berry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Berry "Bill Berry") and [Mike Mills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mills "Mike Mills"),[^11] who had played music together since high school [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 30">: 30 </span></sup>  and had lived together in [Macon, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macon,_Georgia "Macon, Georgia").[^13] The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that "there was never any grand plan behind any of it".[^9] Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in the deconsecrated [St. Mary's Episcopal Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Episcopal_Church_\(Athens,_Georgia\) "St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Athens, Georgia)") on Oconee Street in Athens. "I remember our very first practice," recalled Mills in 2024. "Bill and I had some stuff left over from our band in Macon. We showed it to Peter and Michael, and they took it to places—even that very first night—that I didn't expect. I thought, 'This works for me.'" [^14] He continued: "Bill and I had a bunch of songs from a band we were in in Macon, and we showed \[Peter and Michael\] those songs. Peter was playing [arpeggiated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio "Arpeggio") stuff – nobody plays that. And Michael: the voice was there, and he did some fun things with the melodies. I thought, 'These guys are bringing something to the game.'" [^15] They fleshed out their performances at their rehearsal space, on Jackson Street in Athens.[^15]

They played their first show on April 5, 1980, supported by [the Side Effects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Side_Effects_\(band\) "The Side Effects (band)") at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers.[^10] After considering names such as "Cans of Piss", "Negro Eyes", and "Twisted Kites",[^10] the band settled on "R.E.M.", which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 39">: 39 </span></sup>  *R.E.M.* is well known as an abbreviation for [rapid eye movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep "Rapid eye movement sleep"), the dream stage of sleep; however, sleep researcher Rafael Pelayo reports that when his colleague [William Dement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dement "William Dement"), the sleep scientist who coined the term *REM*, reached out to the band, Dement was told that the band was named "not after REM sleep".[^16]

[Mitch Easter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Easter "Mitch Easter") (left) was R.E.M.'s producer until 1984, helping to define the band's early sound.

The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group.[^17] They found a manager in [Jefferson Holt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Holt "Jefferson Holt"), a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of [Chapel Hill, North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"), that he moved to Athens.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 41">: 41 </span></sup>  R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the [Athens music scene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Athens,_Georgia "Music of Athens, Georgia").[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 46">: 46 </span></sup>  Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. "We made it up as we went along with people who owned bars or pizza joints or coffee shops or gay bars or biker bars," said Mills. "Anybody that wanted this kind of music there, they would make a way for it to happen in their place. It was so exciting." [^15] The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt (and any band member except Stipe),[^15] and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 53–54">: 53–54 </span></sup> 

During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded their first single, " [Radio Free Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe_\(song\) "Radio Free Europe (song)") ", at producer [Mitch Easter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Easter "Mitch Easter") 's [Drive-In Studio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-In_Studio "Drive-In Studio") in [Winston-Salem, North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston-Salem,_North_Carolina "Winston-Salem, North Carolina"), after a recommendation by [Peter Holsapple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Holsapple "Peter Holsapple").[^18] Initially distributing it as a four-track demo tape to clubs, record labels and magazines, the single was released in July 1981 on the local [independent record label](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_record_label "Independent record label") [Hib-Tone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hib-Tone "Hib-Tone") with an initial pressing of 1,000 copies—600 of which were sent out as promotional copies. The single quickly sold out, and another 6,000 copies were pressed due to popular demand, despite the original pressing leaving off the record label's contact details.[^19] [^10] Despite its limited pressing, the single garnered critical acclaim, and was listed as one of the ten best singles of the year by *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")*.[^1]<sup><span title="Page: 497">: 497 </span></sup> 

R.E.M. recorded the *[Chronic Town](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_Town "Chronic Town")* EP with Mitch Easter in October 1981, and planned to release it on a new indie label named Dasht Hopes.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 59">: 59 </span></sup>  However, [I.R.S. Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.R.S._Records "I.R.S. Records") acquired a demo of the band's first recording session with Easter that had been circulating for months.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 61–63">: 61–63 </span></sup>  The band turned down the advances of major label [RCA Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_Records "RCA Records") in favor of I.R.S., with whom they signed a contract in May 1982. I.R.S. released *Chronic Town* that August as its first American release.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 66–67">: 66–67 </span></sup>  A positive review of the EP by *[NME](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME "NME")* praised the songs' auras of mystery, and concluded, "R.E.M. ring true, and it's great to hear something as unforced and cunning as this." [^21]

I.R.S. first paired R.E.M. with producer [Stephen Hague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hague "Stephen Hague") to record their debut album. Hague's emphasis on technical perfection left the band unsatisfied, and the band members asked the label to let them record with Easter.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 72">: 72 </span></sup>  I.R.S. agreed to a "tryout" session, allowing the band to return to [North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina "North Carolina") and record the song "Pilgrimage" with Easter and producing partner [Don Dixon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Dixon_\(musician\) "Don Dixon (musician)"). After hearing the track, I.R.S. permitted the group to record the album with Dixon and Easter.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 78">: 78 </span></sup>  Because of their bad experience with Hague, the band recorded the album via a process of negation, refusing to incorporate rock music clichés such as [guitar solos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_solo "Guitar solo") or then-popular [synthesizers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer "Synthesizer"), in order to give its music a timeless feel.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 78–82">: 78–82 </span></sup>  The completed album, *[Murmur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmur_\(album\) "Murmur (album)")*, was greeted with critical acclaim upon its release in 1983, with *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* listing the album as its record of the year.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 73">: 73 </span></sup>  The album reached number 36 on the *[Billboard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_\(magazine\) "Billboard (magazine)")* album chart.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  A re-recorded version of "Radio Free Europe" was the album's lead single and reached number 78 on the *Billboard* singles chart in 1983.[^22] Despite the acclaim awarded the album, *Murmur* sold only about 200,000 copies, which I.R.S.'s Jay Boberg felt was below expectations.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 95">: 95 </span></sup> 

R.E.M. made their first national television appearance on *[Late Night with David Letterman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_with_David_Letterman "Late Night with David Letterman")* in October 1983,[^1]<sup><span title="Page: 432">: 432 </span></sup>  during which the group performed a new, unnamed song.[^1]<sup><span title="Page: 434">: 434 </span></sup>  The piece, eventually titled " [So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/So._Central_Rain_\(I%27m_Sorry\) "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)") ", became the first single from the band's second album, *[Reckoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckoning_\(R.E.M._album\) "Reckoning (R.E.M. album)")* (1984), which was also recorded with Easter and Dixon. The album met with critical acclaim; *NME* ' s [Mat Snow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Snow "Mat Snow") wrote that *Reckoning* "confirms R.E.M. as one of the most beautifully exciting groups on the planet".[^23] While *Reckoning* peaked at number 27 on the US album charts—an unusually high chart placing for a [college rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rock "College rock") band at the time—scant airplay and poor distribution overseas resulted in it charting no higher than number 91 in Britain.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 115">: 115 </span></sup>

The band's third album, *[Fables of the Reconstruction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_of_the_Reconstruction "Fables of the Reconstruction")* (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer [Joe Boyd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Boyd "Joe Boyd"), who had worked with [Fairport Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairport_Convention "Fairport Convention") and [Nick Drake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake "Nick Drake"), to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food;[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 131–132">: 131–132 </span></sup>  the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 135">: 135 </span></sup>  The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of [Southern mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic "Southern Gothic"), noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by "the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on... legends and fables to the grandchildren".[^24]

They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including the Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's [Hammersmith Palais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammersmith_Palais "Hammersmith Palais")), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and West Germany.[^25] On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in [Bochum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum "Bochum"), West Germany, for the German TV show *[Rockpalast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockpalast "Rockpalast")*. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time.[^26] [^27] R.E.M. invited California punk band [Minutemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen_\(band\) "Minutemen (band)") to open for them on part of the US tour, and organized a benefit for the family of Minutemen frontman [D. Boon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Boon "D. Boon") who died in a December 1985 car crash shortly after the tour's conclusion.[^28] *Fables of the Reconstruction* performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 140">: 140 </span></sup>  As with the previous records, the singles from *Fables of the Reconstruction* were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 159">: 159 </span></sup> 

For their fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted [John Mellencamp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp "John Mellencamp") 's producer [Don Gehman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Gehman "Don Gehman"). The album, entitled *[Lifes Rich Pageant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifes_Rich_Pageant "Lifes Rich Pageant")* (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the *[Chicago Tribune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune "Chicago Tribune")*, Peter Buck related, "Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice." [^29] The album improved markedly upon the sales of *Fables of the Reconstruction* and reached number 21 on the *Billboard* album chart. The single " [Fall on Me](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_on_Me_\(R.E.M._song\) "Fall on Me (R.E.M. song)") " also picked up support on commercial radio.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 151">: 151 </span></sup>  The album was the band's first to be certified gold for selling 500,000 copies.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 142">: 142 </span></sup>  While American college radio remained R.E.M.'s core support, the band was beginning to chart hits on mainstream rock formats; however, the music still encountered resistance from [Top 40 radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio "Contemporary hit radio").[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 160">: 160 </span></sup> 

Following the success of *Lifes Rich Pageant*, I.R.S. issued *[Dead Letter Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Letter_Office_\(album\) "Dead Letter Office (album)")*, a compilation of tracks recorded by the band during their album sessions, many of which had either been issued as [B-sides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-side "B-side") or left unreleased altogether. Shortly thereafter, I.R.S. compiled R.E.M.'s music video catalog (except "Wolves, Lower") as the band's first video release, *[Succumbs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succumbs "Succumbs")*.

[Scott Litt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Litt "Scott Litt") produced a number of R.E.M.'s albums from the late 1980s to the early to mid-1990s.

Don Gehman was unable to produce R.E.M.'s fifth album, so he suggested the group work with [Scott Litt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Litt "Scott Litt").[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 146">: 146 </span></sup>  Litt would be the producer for the band's next five albums. *[Document](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_\(album\) "Document (album)")* (1987) featured some of Stipe's most openly political lyrics, particularly on "Welcome to the Occupation" and "Exhuming McCarthy", which were reactions to the [conservative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States "Conservatism in the United States") political environment of the 1980s under American president [Ronald Reagan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan").[^31] [Jon Pareles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pareles "Jon Pareles") of *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* wrote in his review of the album, " ' *Document* ' is both confident and defiant; if R.E.M. is about to move from cult-band status to mass popularity, the album decrees that the band will get there on its own terms." [^32] *Document* was R.E.M.'s breakthrough album, and the first single " [The One I Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_I_Love_\(R.E.M._song\) "The One I Love (R.E.M. song)") " charted in the Top 20 in the US, UK, and Canada.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  By January 1988, *Document* had become the group's first album to sell a million copies.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 157">: 157 </span></sup>  In light of the band's breakthrough, the December 1987 cover of *Rolling Stone* declared R.E.M. "America's Best Rock & Roll Band".[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 163">: 163 </span></sup> 

Frustrated that its records did not see satisfactory overseas distribution, R.E.M. left I.R.S. when its contract expired and signed with the major label [Warner Bros. Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records "Warner Bros. Records").[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 174">: 174 </span></sup>  Though other labels offered more money, R.E.M. ultimately signed with Warner Bros.—reportedly for an amount between $6 million and $12 million—due to the company's assurance of total creative freedom. (Jay Boberg claimed that R.E.M.'s deal with Warner Bros. was for $22 million, which Peter Buck disputed as "definitely wrong".) [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 177">: 177 </span></sup>  In the aftermath of the group's departure, I.R.S. released the 1988 "best of" compilation *[Eponymous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponymous_\(album\) "Eponymous (album)")* (assembled with input from the band members) to capitalize on assets the company still possessed.[^30]<sup><span title="Pages: 170–171">: 170–171 </span></sup>  The band's first album from Warner Bros., *[Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_\(R.E.M._album\) "Green (R.E.M. album)")* (1988), was recorded in [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee "Memphis, Tennessee"), and showcased the group experimenting with its sound.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 179">: 179 </span></sup>  The record's tracks ranged from the upbeat first single " [Stand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_\(R.E.M._song\) "Stand (R.E.M. song)") " (a hit in the United States),[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 180">: 180 </span></sup>  to more political material, like the rock-oriented " [Orange Crush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Crush_\(song\) "Orange Crush (song)") " and "World Leader Pretend", which address the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War") and the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), respectively.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 183">: 183 </span></sup>  *Green* has gone on to sell four million copies worldwide.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 296">: 296 </span></sup>  The band supported the album with their biggest and most visually developed tour to date, featuring back-projections and [art films](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_film "Art film") playing on the stage.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 184">: 184 </span></sup>  After the [*Green* World Tour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_World_Tour "Green World Tour"), the band members unofficially decided to take the following year off, the first extended break in the band's career.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 198">: 198 </span></sup>  In 1990, Warner Bros. issued the music video compilation *[Pop Screen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Screen "Pop Screen")* to collect clips from the *Document* and *Green* albums, followed a few months later by the video album *[Tourfilm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourfilm "Tourfilm")* featuring live performances filmed during the *Green* World Tour.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 181">: 181 </span></sup> 

R.E.M. reconvened in mid 1990 to record their seventh album, *[Out of Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Time_\(album\) "Out of Time (album)")*. In a departure from *Green*, the band members often wrote the music with non-traditional rock instrumentation including [mandolin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandolin "Mandolin"), [organ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_\(music\) "Organ (music)"), and [acoustic guitar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_guitar "Acoustic guitar") instead of adding them as overdubs later in the creative process.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 209">: 209 </span></sup>  [^33] Released in March 1991, *Out of Time* was the band's first album to top both the US and UK charts.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  The record eventually sold 4.2 million copies in the US alone,[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 287">: 287 </span></sup>  and about 12 million copies worldwide by 1996.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 296">: 296 </span></sup>  The album's lead single, " [Losing My Religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_My_Religion "Losing My Religion") ", was a worldwide hit that received heavy rotation on radio, as did the music video on [MTV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV "MTV") and [VH1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1 "VH1").[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 205">: 205 </span></sup>  "Losing My Religion" was also R.E.M.'s highest-charting single in the US, reaching number four on the *Billboard* charts.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  "There've been very few life-changing events in our career because our career has been so gradual," Mills said years later. In 2024, he added: "If we'd sold ten million of our first record, I doubt any of us would be alive right now." [^34] Regarding a pivotal moment, he said: "If you want to talk about life changing, I think 'Losing My Religion' is the closest it gets".[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 204">: 204 </span></sup>  The album's second single, " [Shiny Happy People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_Happy_People "Shiny Happy People") "—one of three songs on the record to feature vocals from [Kate Pierson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Pierson "Kate Pierson") of fellow Athens band [the B-52's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_B-52%27s "The B-52's"), was also a major hit, reaching number 10 in the US and number six in the UK.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  *Out of Time* garnered R.E.M. seven nominations at the [1992 Grammy Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1992 "Grammy Awards of 1992"), the most nominations of any artist that year. The band won three awards: one for [Best Alternative Music Album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Alternative_Music_Album "Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album") and two for "Losing My Religion", [Best Short Form Music Video](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video "Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video") and [Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Performance_by_a_Duo_or_Group_with_Vocal "Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal").[^35] R.E.M. did not tour to promote *Out of Time*; instead, the band played a series of shows, including an appearance taped for an episode of *[MTV Unplugged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged "MTV Unplugged")* [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 213">: 213 </span></sup>  and released music videos for each song on the video album *[This Film Is On](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Film_Is_On "This Film Is On")*. The band also performed "Losing My Religion" with members of the [Atlanta Symphony Orchestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Symphony_Orchestra "Atlanta Symphony Orchestra") at Madison–Morgan Cultural Center, in [Madison, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Georgia "Madison, Georgia"), as part of MTV's 10th-anniversary special.[^36]

After spending some months off, R.E.M. returned to the studio in 1991 to record their next album. In late 1992, the band released *[Automatic for the People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_for_the_People "Automatic for the People")*. Even though the group had intended to make a harder-rocking album after the softer textures of *Out of Time*,[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 216">: 216 </span></sup>  the somber *Automatic for the People* "\[seemed\] to move at an even more agonized crawl", according to *[Melody Maker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Maker "Melody Maker")*.[^37] The album dealt with themes of loss and mourning inspired by "that sense of... turning thirty", according to Buck.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 218">: 218 </span></sup>  Several songs featured [string](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument "String instrument") [arrangements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement "Arrangement") by former [Led Zeppelin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin "Led Zeppelin") bassist [John Paul Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones_\(musician\) "John Paul Jones (musician)"). Considered by a number of critics (as well as by Buck and Mills) to be the band's best album,[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 217">: 217 </span></sup>  *Automatic for the People* reached numbers one and two on UK and US charts, respectively, and generated the American Top 40 hit singles " [Drive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_\(R.E.M._song\) "Drive (R.E.M. song)") ", " [Man on the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_on_the_Moon_\(R.E.M._song\) "Man on the Moon (R.E.M. song)") ", and " [Everybody Hurts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Hurts "Everybody Hurts") ".[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  The album would sell over fifteen million copies worldwide.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 296">: 296 </span></sup>  As with *Out of Time*, there was no tour in support of the album. The decision to forgo a tour, in conjunction with Stipe's physical appearance, generated rumors that the singer was dying or [HIV-positive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive "HIV-positive"), which were vehemently denied by the band.[^37]

After the band released two slow-paced albums in a row, R.E.M.'s 1994 album *[Monster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_\(R.E.M._album\) "Monster (R.E.M. album)")* was, as Buck said, "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." In contrast to the sound of its predecessors, the music of *Monster* consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s [glam rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock "Glam rock").[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 236">: 236 </span></sup>  Like *Out of Time*, *Monster* topped the charts in both the US and UK.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  The record sold about nine million copies worldwide.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 296">: 296 </span></sup>  The singles " [What's the Frequency, Kenneth?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Frequency,_Kenneth%3F "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?")" and " [Bang and Blame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_and_Blame "Bang and Blame") " were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from *Monster* reached the Top 30 on the British charts.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from *Automatic for the People* for release as *[Parallel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_\(video\) "Parallel (video)")* in 1995.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 270">: 270 </span></sup> 

In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 248">: 248 </span></sup>  On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in [Lausanne, Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne,_Switzerland "Lausanne, Switzerland"), having suffered a [brain aneurysm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_aneurysm "Brain aneurysm"). He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the *Monster* tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a [hernia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia "Hernia").[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 251–255">: 251–255 </span></sup>  Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 256">: 256 </span></sup>  The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia, and released in home video form as *[Road Movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Movie_\(video\) "Road Movie (video)")*.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 274">: 274 </span></sup> 

R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a reported $80 million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), rumored to be the largest recording contract in history at that point.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 258">: 258 </span></sup>  The group's 1996 album *[New Adventures in Hi-Fi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Adventures_in_Hi-Fi "New Adventures in Hi-Fi")* debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>  The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 269">: 269 </span></sup>  Critical reaction to the album was mostly favorable. In a 2017 retrospective on the band, *[Consequence of Sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequence_of_Sound "Consequence of Sound")* ranked it third out of R.E.M.'s 15 full-length studio albums.[^38] The album is Stipe's favorite from R.E.M. and he considers it the band at their peak.[^39] Mills says, "It usually takes a good few years for me to decide where an album stands in the pantheon of recorded work we've done. This one may be third behind *Murmur* and *Automatic for the People*.[^40] According to DiscoverMusic: "Arguably less immediate and less accessible \[...\] *New Adventures in Hi-Fi* is a sprawling, "White Album"-esque affair clocking in at 65 minutes. However, while it required some time and commitment from the listener, the record's contents were rich, compelling and frequently stunning. Accordingly, the album has continued to lobby for recognition and has long since earned its reputation as R.E.M.'s most unsung LP." [^41] While sales were impressive, they were below their previous major label records. *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_magazine "Time magazine") '* s writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole.[^42] That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to [sexual harassment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment "Sexual harassment") charges levied against him by a member of the band's home office in Athens.[^43] The group's lawyer [Bertis Downs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertis_Downs "Bertis Downs") assumed managerial duties.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 259">: 259 </span></sup> 

In April 1997, the band convened at Buck's [Kauai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai "Kauai") vacation home to record demos of material intended for the next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments.[^44] Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell the rest of the band that he was quitting.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 276">: 276 </span></sup>  Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 280">: 280 </span></sup>  Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I have been in the past about doing this anymore... I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [^44] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 280">: 280 </span></sup> 

After drummer [Bill Berry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Berry "Bill Berry") quit in 1997, R.E.M. continued as a trio.

The band cancelled their scheduled recording sessions as a result of Berry's departure. "Without Bill it was different, confusing", Mills later said. "We didn't know exactly what to do. We couldn't rehearse without a drummer." [^45]<sup><span title="Page: 232">: <a href="https://archive.org/details/revealstoryofrem00john/page/232">232</a></span></sup> The remaining members of R.E.M. resumed work on the album in February 1998 at Toast Studios in San Francisco.[^45]<sup><span title="Page: 233">: <a href="https://archive.org/details/revealstoryofrem00john/page/233">233</a></span></sup> The band ended their decade-long collaboration with Scott Litt and hired [Pat McCarthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McCarthy_\(record_producer\) "Patrick McCarthy (record producer)") to produce the record. [Nigel Godrich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Godrich "Nigel Godrich") was taken on as assistant producer, and drafted in [Screaming Trees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screaming_Trees "Screaming Trees") member [Barrett Martin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_Martin "Barrett Martin") and [Beck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck "Beck") 's touring drummer [Joey Waronker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Waronker "Joey Waronker"). The recording process was tense, and the group came close to disbanding. Bertis Downs called an emergency meeting in which the band members resolved their problems and agreed to continue as a group.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 286">: 286 </span></sup>  Led by the single " [Daysleeper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daysleeper "Daysleeper") ", *[Up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_\(R.E.M._album\) "Up (R.E.M. album)")* (1998) debuted in the top ten in the US and UK. However, the album was a relative failure, selling 900,000 copies in the US by mid-1999 and eventually selling just over two million copies worldwide.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 287">: 287 </span></sup>  While R.E.M.'s American sales were declining, the group's commercial base was shifting to the UK, where more R.E.M. records were sold per capita than any other country and the band's singles regularly entered the Top 20.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 292">: 292 </span></sup> 

A year after *[Up](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_\(R.E.M._album\) "Up (R.E.M. album)")* ' s release, R.E.M. wrote the instrumental score to the [Andy Kaufman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kaufman "Andy Kaufman") [biographical film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film "Biographical film") *[Man on the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_on_the_Moon_\(film\) "Man on the Moon (film)")*, a first for the group. The film took its title from the *Automatic for the People* song of the same name.[^46] The song " [The Great Beyond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Beyond "The Great Beyond") " was released as a single from the *[Man on the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_on_the_Moon_\(soundtrack\) "Man on the Moon (soundtrack)")* soundtrack album. "The Great Beyond" only reached number 57 on the American pop charts, but was the band's highest-charting single ever in the UK, reaching number three in 2000.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 357–58">: 357–58 </span></sup>

R.E.M. recorded the majority of their twelfth album *[Reveal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reveal_\(R.E.M._album\) "Reveal (R.E.M. album)")* (2001) in Canada and Ireland from May to October 2000.[^45]<sup><span title="Pages: 248–249">: <a href="https://archive.org/details/revealstoryofrem00john/page/248">248–249</a></span></sup> *Reveal* shared the "lugubrious pace" of *Up*,[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 303">: 303 </span></sup>  and featured drumming by Joey Waronker, as well as contributions by [Scott McCaughey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McCaughey "Scott McCaughey") (a co-founder of the band [the Minus 5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minus_5 "The Minus 5") with Buck), and [Ken Stringfellow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Stringfellow "Ken Stringfellow") (founder of [the Posies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Posies "The Posies")). Global sales of the album were over four million, but in the United States *Reveal* sold about the same number of copies as *Up*.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 310">: 310 </span></sup>  The album was led by the single " [Imitation of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation_of_Life_\(song\) "Imitation of Life (song)") ", which reached number six in the UK.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 305">: 305 </span></sup>  Writing for *Rock's Backpages*, The Rev. Al Friston described the album as "loaded with golden loveliness at every twist and turn", in comparison to the group's "essentially unconvincing work on *New Adventures in Hi-Fi* and *Up* ".[^47] Similarly, [Rob Sheffield](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Sheffield "Rob Sheffield") of *[Rolling Stone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")* called *Reveal* "a spiritual renewal rooted in a musical one" and praised its "ceaselessly astonishing beauty".[^48]

In 2003, Warner Bros. released the compilation album and DVD *[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Time:_The_Best_of_R.E.M._1988%E2%80%932003 "In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003")* and *[In View: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_View:_The_Best_of_R.E.M._1988%E2%80%932003 "In View: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003")*, which featured two new songs, " [Bad Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Day_\(R.E.M._song\) "Bad Day (R.E.M. song)") " and " [Animal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_\(R.E.M._song\) "Animal (R.E.M. song)") ". At a 2003 concert in [Raleigh, North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina "Raleigh, North Carolina"), Berry made a surprise appearance, performing backing vocals on "Radio Free Europe". He then sat behind the drum kit for a performance of the early R.E.M. song "Permanent Vacation", marking his first performance with the band since his retirement.[^49] [^50]

R.E.M. released *[Around the Sun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_Sun "Around the Sun")* in 2004. During production of the album in 2002, Stipe said, "\[The album\] sounds like it's taking off from the last couple of records into unchartered R.E.M. territory. Kind of primitive and howling".[^51] After the album's release, Mills said, "I think, honestly, it turned out a little slower than we intended for it to, just in terms of the overall speed of songs." [^52] *Around the Sun* received a mixed critical reception, and peaked at number 13 on the *Billboard* charts.[^53] The first single from the album, " [Leaving New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_New_York "Leaving New York") ", was a Top 5 hit in the UK.[^54] For the record and subsequent tour, the band hired a new full-time touring drummer, [Bill Rieflin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Rieflin "Bill Rieflin"), who had previously been a member of several [industrial music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music "Industrial music") acts such as [Ministry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_\(band\) "Ministry (band)") and [Pigface](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigface "Pigface"), and remained in that role for the duration of the band's active years.[^55] The video album *[Perfect Square](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Square "Perfect Square")* was released that same year.

[EMI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI "EMI") released a compilation album covering R.E.M.'s work during its tenure on I.R.S. in 2006 called *[And I Feel Fine... The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982–1987](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_I_Feel_Fine..._The_Best_of_the_I.R.S._Years_1982%E2%80%931987 "And I Feel Fine... The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982–1987")* along with the video album *[When the Light Is Mine: The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982–1987](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Light_Is_Mine:_The_Best_of_the_I.R.S._Years_1982%E2%80%931987 "When the Light Is Mine: The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982–1987")* —the label had previously released the compilations *[The Best of R.E.M.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_R.E.M. "The Best of R.E.M.")* (1991), *[R.E.M.: Singles Collected](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.:_Singles_Collected "R.E.M.: Singles Collected")* (1994), and *[R.E.M.: In the Attic – Alternative Recordings 1985–1989](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.:_In_the_Attic_%E2%80%93_Alternative_Recordings_1985%E2%80%931989 "R.E.M.: In the Attic – Alternative Recordings 1985–1989")* (1997). That same month, all four original band members performed during the ceremony for their induction into the [Georgia Music Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Music_Hall_of_Fame "Georgia Music Hall of Fame").[^56] While rehearsing for the ceremony, the band recorded a cover of [John Lennon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon "John Lennon") 's " [#9 Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_9_Dream "Number 9 Dream") " for *[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Karma:_The_Amnesty_International_Campaign_to_Save_Darfur "Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur")*, a tribute album benefiting [Amnesty International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International").[^57] The song—released as a single for the album and the campaign—featured Bill Berry's first studio recording with the band since his departure almost a decade earlier.[^58]

In October 2006, R.E.M. was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility.[^59] The band was one of five nominees accepted into the Hall that year, and the induction ceremony took place in March 2007 at New York's [Waldorf-Astoria Hotel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel "Waldorf-Astoria Hotel"). The group—which was inducted by Pearl Jam lead singer [Eddie Vedder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Vedder "Eddie Vedder") —performed three songs with Bill Berry; " [Gardening at Night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening_at_Night "Gardening at Night") ", " [Man on the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_on_the_Moon_\(R.E.M._song\) "Man on the Moon (R.E.M. song)") " and " [Begin the Begin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begin_the_Begin "Begin the Begin") " as well as a cover of " [I Wanna Be Your Dog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wanna_Be_Your_Dog "I Wanna Be Your Dog") ".[^60]

Work on the group's fourteenth album commenced in early 2007. The band recorded with producer [Jacknife Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacknife_Lee "Jacknife Lee") in Vancouver and Dublin, where it played five nights in the [Olympia Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_Theatre,_Dublin "Olympia Theatre, Dublin") between June 30 and July 5 as part of a "working rehearsal".[^61] *[R.E.M. Live](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._Live "R.E.M. Live")*, the band's first live album (featuring songs from a 2005 Dublin show), was released in October 2007.[^62] The group followed this with the 2009 live album *[Live at The Olympia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Olympia_\(R.E.M._album\) "Live at the Olympia (R.E.M. album)")*, which features performances from its 2007 residency. R.E.M. released *[Accelerate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerate_\(R.E.M._album\) "Accelerate (R.E.M. album)")* in early 2008. The album debuted at number two on the *Billboard* charts,[^63] and became the band's eighth album to top the British album charts.[^64] *Rolling Stone* reviewer [David Fricke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fricke "David Fricke") considered *Accelerate* an improvement over the band's previous post-Berry albums, calling it "one of the best records R.E.M. have ever made".[^65]

R.E.M. onstage in 2008

In 2010, R.E.M. released the video album *[R.E.M. Live from Austin, TX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._Live_from_Austin,_TX "R.E.M. Live from Austin, TX")* —a concert recorded for *[Austin City Limits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Limits "Austin City Limits")* in 2008. The group recorded its fifteenth album, *[Collapse into Now](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_into_Now "Collapse into Now")* (2011), with Jacknife Lee in locales including Berlin, Nashville, and New Orleans. For the album, the band aimed for a more expansive sound than the intentionally short and speedy approach implemented on *[Accelerate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerate_\(R.E.M._album\) "Accelerate (R.E.M. album)")*.[^66] The album debuted at number five on the *Billboard* 200, becoming the group's tenth album to reach the top ten of the chart.[^67] This release fulfilled R.E.M.'s contractual obligations to Warner Bros., and the band began recording material without a contract a few months later with the possible intention of self-releasing the work.[^68]

On September 21, 2011, R.E.M. announced via its website that it was "calling it a day as a band". Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it "wasn't an easy decision": "All things must end, and we wanted to do it right, to do it our way." [^69] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband.[^70] The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of *Around the Sun*; according to Mills, "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that we could still make great records." [^71] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M.[^72] The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album *[Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_Lies,_Part_Heart,_Part_Truth,_Part_Garbage_1982%E2%80%932011 "Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011")*, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post- *Collapse into Now* sessions.[^73] In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.[^74]

In 2014, *[Unplugged: The Complete 1991 and 2001 Sessions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unplugged:_The_Complete_1991_and_2001_Sessions "Unplugged: The Complete 1991 and 2001 Sessions")* was released for [Record Store Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_Store_Day "Record Store Day").[^75] Download collections of [I.R.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Rarities:_I.R.S._1982%E2%80%931987 "Complete Rarities: I.R.S. 1982–1987") and [Warner Bros.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Rarities:_Warner_Bros._1988%E2%80%932011 "Complete Rarities: Warner Bros. 1988–2011") rarities followed. Later in the year, R.E.M. compiled the video album box set *[REMTV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/REMTV "REMTV")*, which collected their two *Unplugged* performances along with several other documentaries and live shows, while their record label released the box set *[7IN—83–88](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7IN%E2%80%9483%E2%80%9388 "7IN—83–88")*, made up of [7-inch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-inch "7-inch") vinyl singles.[^76] In December 2015, the band members agreed to a distribution deal with [Concord Bicycle Music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_Bicycle_Music "Concord Bicycle Music") to re-release their Warner Bros. albums.[^77]

In March 2016, R.E.M. signed a publishing administration deal with [Universal Music Publishing Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Publishing_Group "Universal Music Publishing Group").[^78] In March 2017, R.E.M. left [Broadcast Music, Inc.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Music,_Inc. "Broadcast Music, Inc."), who had represented their [performance rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights "Performance rights") for their entire career, and joined [SESAC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SESAC "SESAC").[^79] The first release under SESAC was the 2018 box set *[R.E.M. at the BBC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._at_the_BBC "R.E.M. at the BBC")*, followed in 2019 by *[Live at the Borderline 1991](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Borderline_1991 "Live at the Borderline 1991")* for Record Store Day. On March 24, 2020, Rieflin died of cancer.[^80]

In October 2019, during the presentation of his book of photographs in Rome, Stipe said: "I'm having dinner with Mike (Mills) just tomorrow night in London and I spoke to Peter (Buck) last night, we're good friends but R.E.M.'s time it's over, that's it".[^81]

In September 2021, a decade after disbanding, Stipe reiterated that R.E.M. had no intention of regrouping: "We decided when we split up that that would just be really tacky and probably money-grabbing, which might be the impetus for a lot of bands to get back together." [^82] In 2023, R.E.M. was nominated for induction into the [Songwriters Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame "Songwriters Hall of Fame") [^83] and were inducted in June 2024.[^84] To mark this occasion, on June 13, 2024, all four founding members reunited for their first public live performance since 2007 and performed an acoustic rendition of "Losing My Religion" in New York City.[^85] [^86] They reunited for another live performance in February 2025, this time performing "Pretty Persuasion" at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia.[^87]

In 2024, during their first interview as a foursome in 27 years, the band was asked what it would take for them to re-form. "A comet", replied Mills. "Superglue", added Berry. When asked why it would not happen, Buck stated, "It would never be as good." [^88]

R.E.M.'s music has been described as [alternative rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock "Alternative rock"),[^89] [college rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rock "College rock"),[^90] [folk rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_rock "Folk rock"),[^91] [jangle pop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangle_pop "Jangle pop"),[^92] [post-punk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk "Post-punk"),[^92] and [new wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music "New wave music").[^93] In a 1988 interview, Peter Buck described R.E.M. songs as typically, "Minor key, mid-tempo, enigmatic, semi-folk-rock-balladish things. That's what everyone thinks and to a certain degree, that's true." [^94]

All songwriting is credited to the entire band, even though individual members are sometimes responsible for writing the majority of a particular song.[^95] Each member is given an equal vote in the songwriting process; however, Buck has conceded that Stipe, as the band's lyricist, can rarely be persuaded to follow an idea he does not favor.[^37] Among the original line-up, there were divisions of labor in the songwriting process: Stipe would write lyrics and devise melodies, Buck would edge the band in new musical directions, and Mills and Berry would fine-tune the compositions due to their greater musical experience.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 85">: 85 </span></sup>  Regarding Buck's driven approach, Mills said: "Someone's got to drive the train, and we were all more than happy to have Peter be our motivator." Stipe added, addressing Buck: "There's a body of work that wouldn't be there had you not been pushing us as hard as you did." [^96]

Michael Stipe sings in what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley described as "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures".[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 87">: 87 </span></sup>  Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; in the chorus for "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 180–181">: 180–181 </span></sup>  Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as "mumbling" by *[The Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")*), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable.[^20] *[Creem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creem "Creem")* writer John Morthland wrote in his review of *Murmur*, "I still have no idea what these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [^97] Stipe commented in 1984, "It's just the way I sing. If I tried to control it, it would be pretty false." [^98] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of *Fables of the Reconstruction*.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 133">: 133 </span></sup> 

Stipe referred to the lyrics in the chorus of " [Sitting Still](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitting_Still "Sitting Still") " from R.E.M.'s debut album, *Murmur*, as "nonsense", saying in a 1994 online chat, "You all know there aren't words, *per se*, to a lot of the early stuff. I can't even remember them." In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 88">: 88 </span></sup>  Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [^98] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 143">: 143 </span></sup>  Mills explained, "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes..." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 150">: 150 </span></sup>  Songs like "Cuyahoga" and "Fall on Me" on *Lifes Rich Pageant* dealt with such concerns as pollution.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 156–157">: 156–157 </span></sup>  Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on *Document* and *Green*. "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," Stipe said later. "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [^99] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. *Automatic for the People* dealt with "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe,[^100] while *Monster* critiqued love and mass culture.[^99] Musically, Stipe stated that bands like [T. Rex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rex_\(band\) "T. Rex (band)") and [Mott the Hoople](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_the_Hoople "Mott the Hoople") "really impacted me".[^101]

Peter Buck's guitar-playing style has defined R.E.M.'s sound.

Peter Buck's style of playing guitar has been singled out by many as the most distinctive aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American [folk rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_rock "Folk rock") band [the Byrds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds "The Byrds").[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 77">: 77 </span></sup>  Buck has stated "\[Byrds guitarist\] [Roger McGuinn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McGuinn "Roger McGuinn") was a big influence on me as a guitar player",[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 81">: 81 </span></sup>  but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including [Big Star](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Star "Big Star") and [the Soft Boys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soft_Boys "The Soft Boys"), that inspired him more.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 115">: 115 </span></sup>  Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of [Johnny Marr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr "Johnny Marr") of alternative rock contemporaries [the Smiths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths "The Smiths"). While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr,[^95] whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M.[^30]<sup><span title="Page: 115">: 115 </span></sup>  Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 80">: 80 </span></sup>  Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by [Paul McCartney](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney "Paul McCartney") of [the Beatles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles "The Beatles") and [Chris Squire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Squire "Chris Squire") of [Yes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_\(band\) "Yes (band)"); Mills has said, "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways... I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the [kick drum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_drum "Kick drum"), [root note](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_note "Root note") bass work." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 105">: 105 </span></sup>  Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 81">: 81 </span></sup> 

[Pavement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavement_\(band\) "Pavement (band)"), one of several bands to name R.E.M. as an influence, wrote the song "Unseen Power of the Picket Fence" in honor of them.

R.E.M. was pivotal in the creation and development of the alternative rock genre. [AllMusic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllMusic "AllMusic") stated, "R.E.M. mark the point when [post-punk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk "Post-punk") turned into alternative rock." [^17] In the early 1980s, the musical style of R.E.M. stood in contrast to the post-punk and [new wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music "New wave music") genres that had preceded it. Music journalist [Simon Reynolds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Reynolds "Simon Reynolds") noted that the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s "had taken whole swaths of music off the menu", particularly that of the 1960s, and that "After postpunk's demystification and New Pop's schematics, it felt liberating to listen to music rooted in mystical awe and blissed-out surrender." Reynolds declared R.E.M., a band that recalled the music of the 1960s with its "plangent guitar chimes and folk-styled vocals" and who "wistfully and abstractly conjured visions and new frontiers for America", one of "the two most important alt-rock bands of the day." [^102] With the release of *Murmur*, R.E.M. had the most impact musically and commercially of the developing alternative genre's early groups, leaving in its wake a number of [jangle pop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangle_pop "Jangle pop") followers.[^103]

R.E.M.'s early breakthrough success served as an inspiration for other alternative bands. *[Spin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_\(magazine\) "Spin (magazine)")* referred to the "R.E.M. model"—career decisions that R.E.M. made that set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. *Spin's* Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, "They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd figured out how to buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream." [^104] [Steve Wynn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wynn_\(songwriter\) "Steve Wynn (songwriter)") of [Dream Syndicate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Syndicate "Dream Syndicate") said, "They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was [Sonic Youth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth "Sonic Youth") or [the Replacements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Replacements_\(band\) "The Replacements (band)") or [Nirvana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_\(band\) "Nirvana (band)") or [Butthole Surfers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butthole_Surfers "Butthole Surfers"). R.E.M. staked the claim. Musically, the bands did different things, but R.E.M. was first to show us you can be big and still be cool." [^105] Biographer David Buckley stated that between 1991 and 1994, a period that saw the band sell an estimated 30 million albums, R.E.M. "asserted themselves as rivals to [U2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2 "U2") for the title of biggest rock band in the world." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 200">: 200 </span></sup>  Over the course of its career, the band has sold over 85 million records worldwide.[^106] [Colin Larkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Larkin "Colin Larkin") 's *[All Time Top 1000 Albums](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Time_Top_1000_Albums "All Time Top 1000 Albums")* stated that "Their catalogue is destined to endure as critics reluctantly accept their considerable importance in the history of rock".[^107]

Numerous bands and artists have cited R.E.M. as an influence, including [Nirvana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_\(band\) "Nirvana (band)"), [Pavement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavement_\(band\) "Pavement (band)"), [Radiohead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead "Radiohead"),[^108] [Pearl Jam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam "Pearl Jam"),[^109] [Live](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_\(band\) "Live (band)"),[^110] [Collective Soul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Soul "Collective Soul"),[^109] [Alice in Chains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Chains "Alice in Chains"),[^109] [Better Than Ezra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Than_Ezra "Better Than Ezra"),[^111] [Liz Phair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Phair "Liz Phair"),[^112] and [the Ocean Blue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ocean_Blue "The Ocean Blue").[^113] The Pavement member [Bob Nastanovich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Nastanovich "Bob Nastanovich") said, "When I was 15 years old in Richmond, Virginia, they were a *very* important part of my life, as they were for all the members of our band." [^114] Pavement's contribution to the *[No Alternative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Alternative "No Alternative")* compilation (1993) was "Unseen Power of the Picket Fence", a song about R.E.M.'s early days.[^115] According to their [Twitter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") account, [Local H](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_H "Local H") created their name by combining the R.E.M. song titles "Oddfellows Local 151" and "Swan Swan H".[^116] [Black Francis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Francis "Black Francis") of [the Pixies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_\(band\) "Pixies (band)") described *Murmur* as "hugely influential" on his songwriting.[^117] [Kurt Cobain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain "Kurt Cobain") of Nirvana was a fan of R.E.M., and had unfulfilled plans to collaborate on a musical project with Stipe.[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 239–240">: 239–240 </span></sup>  Cobain told *Rolling Stone* in a 1994 interview, "I don't know how that band does what they do. God, they're the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music." [^118] The Radiohead singer, [Thom Yorke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke "Thom Yorke"), said Radiohead had "ripped off R.E.M. blind for years",[^119] and cited Stipe as his favorite lyricist.[^120] On November 3, 2023, the former [Monkees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees "The Monkees") member [Micky Dolenz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micky_Dolenz "Micky Dolenz") released an EP of R.E.M. cover songs.[^121] [^122]

Michael Stipe has used his celebrity status to support political and humanitarian causes; he is seen here at the 2007 [Tribeca Film Festival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca_Film_Festival "Tribeca Film Festival"), which was created to renew that neighborhood of New York City after the [September 11 attacks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks").

Throughout R.E.M.'s career, its members sought to highlight social and political issues. According to the *[Los Angeles Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")*, R.E.M. was considered to be one of the United States' "most liberal and politically correct rock groups." [^123] The band's members were "on the same page" politically, sharing a [liberal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States "Modern liberalism in the United States") and [progressive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism "Progressivism") outlook.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 155">: 155 </span></sup>  Mills admitted that there was occasionally dissension between band members on what causes they might support, but acknowledged "Out of respect for the people who disagree, those discussions tend to stay in-house, just because we'd rather not let people know where the divisions lie, so people can't exploit them for their own purposes." An example is that in 1990 Buck noted that Stipe was involved with [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals"), but the rest of the band were not.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 197">: 197 </span></sup> 

R.E.M. helped raise funds for environmental, feminist and human rights causes, and were involved in campaigns to encourage [voter registration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration "Voter registration").[^33] During the *Green* tour, Stipe spoke on stage to the audiences about a variety of socio-political issues.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 186">: 186 </span></sup>  Through the late 1980s and 1990s, the band (particularly Stipe) increasingly used its media coverage on national television to mention a variety of causes it felt were important. One example is during the [1991 MTV Video Music Awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_MTV_Video_Music_Awards "1991 MTV Video Music Awards"), Stipe wore a half-dozen white shirts emblazoned with slogans including "rainforest", "love knows no colors", and "handgun control now".[^12]<sup><span title="Pages: 195–196">: 195–196 </span></sup> 

R.E.M. helped raise awareness of [Aung San Suu Kyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi "Aung San Suu Kyi") and [human rights violations in Myanmar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Myanmar "Human rights in Myanmar"), when they worked with the Freedom Campaign and the [US Campaign for Burma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Campaign_for_Burma "US Campaign for Burma").[^124] Stipe himself ran ads for the 1988 election, supporting [Democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(United_States\) "Democratic Party (United States)") presidential candidate and [Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts "Massachusetts") governor [Michael Dukakis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis "Michael Dukakis") over then-Vice President [George H. W. Bush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush "George H. W. Bush").[^125] In 2004, the band participated in the [Vote for Change](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_for_Change "Vote for Change") tour that sought to mobilize American voters to support Democratic presidential candidate [John Kerry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry "John Kerry").[^126] R.E.M.'s political stance, particularly coming from a wealthy rock band under contract to a label owned by a multinational corporation, received criticism from former *[Q](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_magazine "Q magazine")* editor [Paul Du Noyer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Du_Noyer "Paul Du Noyer"), who criticized the band's "celebrity liberalism", saying, "It's an entirely pain-free form of rebellion that they're adopting. There's no risk involved in it whatsoever, but quite a bit of shoring up of customer loyalty." [^12]<sup><span title="Page: 299">: 299 </span></sup> 

From the late 1980s, R.E.M. was involved in the local politics of its hometown of Athens, Georgia.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 192">: 192 </span></sup>  Buck explained to *[Sounds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounds_\(magazine\) "Sounds (magazine)")* in 1987, "Michael always says think local and act local—we have been doing a lot of stuff in our town to try and make it a better place." [^127] The band often donated funds to local charities and helped renovate and preserve historic buildings in the town.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 194">: 194 </span></sup>  [^33] R.E.M.'s political clout was credited with the narrow election of Athens mayor Gwen O'Looney twice in the 1990s.[^12]<sup><span title="Page: 195">: 195 </span></sup>  [^33] The band is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.[^128]

In 2025 the band released a remix of their 1983 hit "Radio Free Europe" in support of the [eponymous organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty"), which was facing severe budget cuts from the [Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") organization.[^129]
