Streams the results of a single query execution specified by `QueryExecutionId` from the Athena query results location in Amazon S3. For more information, see [Working with query results, recent queries, and output files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying.html) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*. This request does not execute the query but returns results. Use [StartQueryExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_StartQueryExecution.html) to run a query.

To stream query results successfully, the IAM principal with permission to call `GetQueryResults` also must have permissions to the Amazon S3 `GetObject` action for the Athena query results location.

###### Important

IAM principals with permission to the Amazon S3 `GetObject` action for the query results location are able to retrieve query results from Amazon S3 even if permission to the `GetQueryResults` action is denied. To restrict user or role access, ensure that Amazon S3 permissions to the Athena query location are denied.
