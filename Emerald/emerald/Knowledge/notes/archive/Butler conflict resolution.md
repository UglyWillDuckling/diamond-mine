## Short
In short, butler will force a creation of a new merge commit that should resolve the conflicts.

* ? This will then be recorded for **both** virtual branches.
The files need to be merged manually.

## Issues

- the conflicting files are not in the same list
		They are actually listed separately for each branch
- it isn't possible to `accept`  changes or resolve conflicts withing [[Butler]]
- most of the time, it is difficult to wrap your head around what is really going on ðŸ¤¯
- ! I don't know why my script got **deleted**!!!
- ! I don't think that this actually works
