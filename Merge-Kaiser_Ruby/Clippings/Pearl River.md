The **Pearl River** ([Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): 珠江; [pinyin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): *Zhūjiāng*; lit. 'pearl river', or 粤江; 粵江; *Yuèjiāng*; ' [Yue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_people "Cantonese people") river') is an extensive [river system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_system "River system") in [southern China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_China "South Central China"). "Pearl River" is often also used as a catch-all for the watersheds of the Pearl [tributaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributaries "Tributaries") within [Guangdong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong "Guangdong"), specifically the [Xi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_River "Xi River") ('west'), [Bei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bei_River "Bei River") ('north'), and [Dong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_River_\(China\) "Dong River (China)") ('east'). These rivers all ultimately flow into the South China Sea through the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta "Pearl River Delta"). Measured from the farthest reaches of the Xi River, the Pearl – [Xi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_River "Xi River") – [Xun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xun_River "Xun River") – [Qian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qian_River "Qian River") – [Hongshui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongshui_River "Hongshui River") – [Nanpan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanpan_River "Nanpan River") 2,400 km (1,500 mi) Pearl River system constitutes China's third-longest, after the [Yangtze River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River "Yangtze River") and the [Yellow River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River"), and its second largest by volume, after the Yangtze. The 453,700 km <sup>2</sup> (175,200 sq mi) Pearl River Basin drains the majority of [Guangdong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong "Guangdong") and [Guangxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi "Guangxi") provinces (collectively known as [Liangguang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangguang "Liangguang")), as well as parts of [Yunnan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan "Yunnan"), [Guizhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou "Guizhou"), [Hunan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan "Hunan") and [Jiangxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi "Jiangxi"); it also drains the northernmost parts of Vietnam's [Northeast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Bac "Dong Bac") [Cao Bằng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_B%E1%BA%B1ng_Province "Cao Bằng Province") and [Lạng Sơn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%E1%BA%A1ng_S%C6%A1n_Province "Lạng Sơn Province") provinces. The Pearl River is famed as the river that flows through [Guangzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou").

As well as referring to the system as a whole, the Pearl River name is applied to a specific branch within it. This Pearl River is the widest [distributary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributary "Distributary") within the delta, although notably short; the waters that converge east of the Bei are first referred to as the Pearl River just north of [Guangzhou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou"). The Pearl River's [estuary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary "Estuary"), [Bocca Tigris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocca_Tigris "Bocca Tigris"), is regularly dredged so as to keep it open for ocean vessels. The mouth of the Pearl River forms a large bay in the southeast of the delta, the [Pearl River Estuary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Estuary "Pearl River Estuary"), the Bocca Tigris separates [Shiziyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiziyang "Shiziyang") in the north, [Lingdingyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingdingyang "Lingdingyang") in the south, and [Jiuzhouyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiuzhouyang "Jiuzhouyang") at the southern tip of the estuary surrounded by the [Wanshan Archipelago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanshan_Archipelago "Wanshan Archipelago"). This bay separates [Macau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau "Macau") and [Zhuhai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai "Zhuhai") from [Hong Kong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong "Hong Kong") and [Shenzhen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen "Shenzhen").

The name "Pearl River" comes from the pearl-colored shells that lie within the Pearl's riverbed as it flows through the city of Guangzhou. A 500 [kV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt") power line, suspended from three of the tallest pylons in the world, crosses the river near the [Nansha Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansha_Bridge "Nansha Bridge").

Numerous brands are named after the river. The [Zhujiang Brewery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhujiang_Brewery "Zhujiang Brewery") in Guangzhou is one of the three largest domestic breweries in China, and Pearl River Bridge is a popular food manufacturer in the city.
