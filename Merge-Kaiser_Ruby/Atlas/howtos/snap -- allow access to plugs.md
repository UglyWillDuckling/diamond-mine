  To give permission to snap, you'll need to configure the snapd daemon to allow
  access to the specific resources or functionality that the snap requires.

  Here are some common ways to give permission to snap:

1. Allow access to specific plugs: Snaps can request access to specific plugs,
  which are keywords that represent a particular capability or resource. For
  example, a snap might request access to the  network  plug to access the
  internet. To allow access to a plug, use the following command:

    sudo snap connect <snap-name>:<plug-name>

  Replace  <snap-name>  with the name of the snap, and  <plug-name>  with the name
  of the plug.

2. Grant classic confinement: Some snaps require classic confinement, which
  allows them to run with full access to the system, similar to traditional Linux
  packages. To grant classic confinement, use the following command:

    sudo snap set <snap-name> classic=True

  Replace  <snap-name>  with the name of the snap.

3. Configure snapd permissions: Snapd has a configuration file that allows you
  to define permissions for snaps. You can edit the  /etc/snapd.conf  file to add
  permissions for specific snaps. For example, you can add the following line to
  allow a snap to access the  system-observe  plug:

    snap `<snap-name>` system-observe

  Replace  <snap-name>  with the name of the snap.

4. Use the  snap  command with the  --allow  flag: When running a snap command,
  you can use the  --allow  flag to grant temporary access to a specific resource
  or plug. For example:

    sudo snap run <snap-name> --allow=network

  Replace  <snap-name>  with the name of the snap, and  network  with the resource
  or plug you want to allow access to.
