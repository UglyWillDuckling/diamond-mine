## What is imapsync? (back to menu)

  
Imapsync presentation by Gilles

Imapsync is an **IMAP transfer tool**. The purpose of imapsync is to **migrate** IMAP accounts or to **backup** IMAP accounts. IMAP, IMAP4 in fact (started December 1994), is one of the three current standard protocols used to access mailboxes, the two other being POP3 (started November 1988) and HTTP (started May 1996) with webmails, webmails are often tied to an IMAP server.

The latest imapsync published release 2.290 was written on Tuesday, 20-Aug-2024 10:39:22 UTC

**Imapsync** is a command-line tool that allows incremental and recursive **IMAP** transfers from one mailbox to another, both anywhere on the internet or in your local network. Imapsync runs on **Windows**, **Linux**, **Mac OS X**. "**Incremental**" means you can stop the transfer at any time and restart it later efficiently, without generating duplicates. "**Recursive**" means the complete folders hierarchy can be copied, all folders, all subfolders etc. "**Command-line**" means it's not a graphical tool, on Windows you have to run imapsync from a [batch file](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#DOC_BASIC). Anyway there is a visual online service, you can try imapsync online at [https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/)

## What imapsync can't do? (back to menu)

**Imapsync can't migrate Contacts and Calendars**. Most email systems don't set or get Contacts or Calendars via the IMAP protocol. No way via IMAP, no way via imapsync but it can be done with other tools or via export/import of csv or ics files. Also consider using [caldavsynchronizer](http://caldavsynchronizer.org/) or asking experts at [Sumatra company](https://twitter.com/sumatra_dev).

**Imapsync is not suitable** for maintaining a synchronization **between two active imap accounts** while the user is working on both sides. See why in the [Two Ways Sync](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Two_Ways_Sync.txt) document. Use [**offlineimap**](http://offlineimap.org/) (written by John Goerzen) or [**mbsync**](http://isync.sourceforge.net/) (written by Michael R. Elkins) for **bidirectional (2 ways) synchronizations**.

**Imapsync can't backup** nor **restore** email messages **to or from a local directory**. Imapsync works only with IMAP accounts, which always belong to some IMAP server. Read the [Archiving](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Archiving.txt) document to get several solutions, at least four solutions, to this issue.

Alternatives to imapsync are listed in the [**Similar softwares**](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/S/external.shtml) section.

Alternatives to the [imapsync online service](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/ "Free online service") are listed in the [**External online services**](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/S/external.shtml#ONLINE_OTHERS) section.

## Buy imapsync and support (back to menu)

> Imapsync was the best investment I've ever done.
> 
> — Uwe Keim [Dec 6 '16 at 12:17](https://serverfault.com/questions/818818/imapsync-or-php-to-migrate-email)

Read some other nice and true [testimonials from users](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/S/testimonial.shtml).  

There is no trial version but I offer **30-day money back guarantee** whatever the reason for a refund. Or drop me a gentle email and I will provide you the latest imapsync because, well, you made the effort to contact me.  
After downloading imapsync, go to the [installation](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#install) documentation.

**Special** offer: it's only **€120 EUR** if you buy **imapsync** + **support** at once (instead of 60 + 120 = 180 EUR).

For **€120 EUR** you will get:

- Imapsync **full professional support** (that costs also €120 EUR by itself, see why below).
- Access without any limit to the imapsync **online service**, like **[/X](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/)**.
- Standalone **imapsync.exe** for win32, easy installation done by a zip extraction anywhere. See [README\_Windows.txt](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/README_Windows.txt) for details.
- Standalone **imapsync\_bin\_Darwin** for [Mac OS X](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/INSTALL.Darwin.txt). (Catalina ok with a permission deed)
- Imapsync Perl **source code** for any operating system, Unix, Windows, OS X.
- The **visual interface**, similar to **[/X](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/)**, to [install the service](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/INSTALL.OnlineUI.txt) on your own **Linux server** (not working on Windows yet).
- **Lifetime** of imapsync **updates** without extra payment.
- **30-day money back guarantee!** No question nor condition to get a refund, really, just request it and you'll sure get a refund!
- [No limit](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/NOLIMIT) to do anything with imapsync and its license.

For **€60 EUR** you will get all the above except imapsync **full professional support** (the first line).

For **€120 EUR** independently, you get imapsync **full professional support**, provided by the imapsync designer and developer, Gilles LAMIRAL, your servitor, who has been supporting imap migrations with imapsync for more than 20 years (I started in 2001). See a detailed [**support description**](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#SUPPORT) below.

You may wonder **why the support alone is the same price as imapsync+support?** It's because when you buy both at once, I'm not sure I will have to spend some time directly with you, it's possible that everything goes smoothly for you, since this aim is my daily work. But when you buy the support alone, after buying the software, then I will surely spend time (any amount of hours) to help you. Does it seem fair enough?

**Instantly** at the end of the payment, Paypal will proposed you to go back to the site, via a link to **gilles@lamiral.info** (it's my paypal account name), this link brings you to **imapsync download**.  
You will also receive an email from **gilles@lamiral.info** a few minutes later (it can fall in the Spam folder sometimes).  
In order to get an accurate invoice, please make sure the delivery postal address you enter in Paypal suits your accounting department, since revised editing is not easy.  
Your **invoice** will be sent within **a few days by email**. My company is identified by VAT number FR74429303332 or French SIRET number 42930333200051, French APE/NAF number 6201Z ("programmation informatique" in French, aka, computer programming).

### Support (back to menu)

For those of you who seek support, **contact me**, Gilles LAMIRAL, by email or phone:

- Email address: **gilles@lamiral.info**.
- Desk phone number: **+33 9 51 84 42 42** located in France.
- Mobile phone number: **+33 6 19 22 03 54** located in France (SFR operator).
- Twitter: [https://twitter.com/imapsync](https://twitter.com/imapsync)

The support is done in English, **mostly by email** or possibly phone/skype. Office hours start at 10:00, end at 16:00 UTC, extra time is possible in case of emergency. The **support aims at helping you to get your imap migration job done**, quickly if possible. Support includes things like **no time to read the documentation**, how to deal with special imap software servers (Gmail, Office365, Exchange etc.), choosing and explaining options, explaining error messages, solving authentication issues, dealing with speed, quotas, special context, running in parallel, etc., so in summary: **anything!** except doing the job for you.

I have been supporting imap migrations with imapsync since 2001, I still enjoy it!

### Payment by bank transfer and IBAN (back to menu)

If you can't pay with a credit card via Paypal then it is possible to pay via a bank transfer.

Refund for a bank transfer is less easier than with Paypal so drop me an email to test imapsync and to be sure it will do what you need it to do, before any payment.  
The bank account references will be given upon request.

It will surely add extra work editing manually the invoice, back and forth getting good coordinates, so I will charge both software and support normal prices for a payment via bank transfer, that is 120 EUR.

### Payment with crypto currencies, Bitcoins, Ethereum etc. (back to menu)

The funny thing about crypto payments is that I receive very few of them, one or two per year, and in small amount, one or two dollars equivalent... Maybe one day those little crypto coins will be like gold? (I will like that!)

## Facts and figures (back to menu)

- There are **6k to 17k** imapsync users per month (74k users for the year 2023) Well, if all users could be buyers! (1k == 1000)
- 15M to 22M mailboxes transfers per month during 2023 (M = million = 10^6).
- **200M** transfers for 2023, that is **6 whole mailboxes completely synced each second** on average (200\*10^6/365/24/3600 ~ 6.3), and an estimation of **85 Petabytes transferred in 2023** ( 1 PiB = 2^50 bytes = 1024^5 ~ 10^15), taking a mean of 480 Megabytes per transfer (an estimated mean given by online /X real stats). 85 Petabytes = 480\*10^6\*200\*10^6. The 2022 global internet traffic was estimated 4200 Exabytes, no evaluation since then. (4200 ~ [(273+77)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic#Global_Internet_traffic) \* 12 ) (1 EiB = 2^60 bytes = 1024^6 ~ 10^18) so imapsync is a very very tiny thing, 20 per million (85/4200000).
- Let's see it another way, imapsync did 200M transfers for 2023, that's nearly **820M email messages transferred every day** (200\*1500/366) taking a mean of 1500 messages per transfer (an estimated mean given by online /X 2023 real stats, 204315341/32228). The internet global estimated number of messages sent every day is [347 billions](https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/) in 2023 (55% being spam but that's another story...). So imapsync does 0.24% (820/347000\*100) of all email traffic, not that bad for a command-line tool!
- See the Wikipedia [Byte page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units) to learn about Petabytes and Exabytes.
- **Operating systems** run by command line imapsync users (in 2023):
- **Linux: 72%**
- **Win32: 14%**
- **Darwin: 14%**
- **FreeBSD: 0.51%**
- Solaris: 0.02%
- OpenBSD: 0.00%
- Other: 0.00%
- Cygwin: 0.00%
- Unknown: 0.00%
- **Highest use rate**: about **56M** IMAP mailbox transfers by just one host (it was in 2014).
- **Biggest known sole account** migrated: **2.4M folders!** (figure independently reported).
- **Operating systems** run by the visual /X online imapsync users in 2023:
- **Windows 71%**
- **Macintosh 23%**
- **Linux 6%**
- **iPhone 0.21%**
- **iPad 0.03%**
- **Android 0.03%**
- **Debian 0.03%**
- Do you notice the reverse statistic pattern between command-line users and visual users?

The figures presented here do not include the GitHub imapsync release usage. It's because --noreleasecheck is on by default since release 1.592 (2014/05/22) in the GitHub release. Looking at the numbers before and after 2014, the figures showed above could be doubled.

Where all those numbers come from? To know whether a newer imapsync exists or not, imapsync does an http GET to the file [VERSION](http://imapsync.lamiral.info/VERSION). Via the **User-agent** parameter it also sends:

- imapsync release
- Perl version
- Mail::IMAPClient version
- Operating System

You can **remove this behavior** by adding the option **\--noreleasecheck** on the command line (or by setting $releasecheck = 0 in the source code). Check [CVE-2013-4279](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-4279).

## How to transfer a single mailbox on Windows (back to menu)

After Imapsync [installation](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#install), you have to edit a "ready to use" batch file called **[imapsync\_example.bat](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/imapsync_example.bat)** and run it by a double-click. This batch file is also in the zip archive so it's useless to download it.

I strongly advise you to read and follow the document [README\_Windows.txt](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/README_Windows.txt)

## How to transfer a single mailbox on Mac (back to menu)

After Imapsync [installation](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#install), you have to edit a "ready to use" script file called **[imapsync\_example\_darwin.bat](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/imapsync_example_darwin.sh)** and run it in a shell window. This script file is also in the tgz archive so it's useless to download it.

I strongly advise you to read first and follow the document [INSTALL.Darwin.txt](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/INSTALL.Darwin.txt) and then the document [TUTORIAL\_Unix](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/doc/TUTORIAL_Unix.html).

## How to transfer a single mailbox on Linux/Unix (back to menu)

Here after is presented a Linux imapsync command line example. You can try it on a terminal, as is. Anyway, it's easier to edit a shell script with the same exact command and run this script in a terminal or from a graphical desktop. Just take the Bourne shell script example **[imapsync\_example.sh](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/imapsync_example.sh)** and adapt with your own parameters. This shell script file is also in the tgz archive so it can be useless to download it.

I strongly advise you to read and follow the document [TUTORIAL\_Unix](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/doc/TUTORIAL_Unix.html).

After Imapsync [installation](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#install), a basic example in a shell terminal is the following:

```
./imapsync   \
  --host1 test1.lamiral.info  \
  --user1 test1               \
  --password1  "secret1"      \
  --host2 test2.lamiral.info  \
  --user2 test2               \
  --password2  "secret2"
```
## How to transfer many mailboxes (back to menu)

In order to migrate many mailboxes, you should use a loop over a csv file containing only the data credentials.  
On Windows, see **[sync\_loop\_windows.bat](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/sync_loop_windows.bat)** batch example.  
On Unix, see **[sync\_loop\_unix.sh](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/sync_loop_unix.sh)** example.  
An example of this csv file is **[file.txt](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/file.txt)**, it can be used with the two previous command scripts.  
All example scripts can be found in the [examples/\*](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/) directory.

I strongly advise you to read also the following FAQ documents:

- [Migration plan](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Migration_Plan.txt).
- [Massive/bulk migrations](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Massive.txt).
- [Admin authentication](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Admin_Authentication.txt).

## Installation, Hardware, Operating Systems (back to menu)

Hardware system requirements:

- **500 MB of RAM** is ok. The mean value RAM used per imapsync process is 230 MB.
- **Any CPU** is ok.
- **100 MB of disk space** is far enough.
- **Any network link** is ok. The average bandwidth rate is 345 KiB/s ~ 2.8 Mbps.

**Operating System** requirements: Imapsync is avalable on Windows, Mac and Linux.  
Which Operating System to chose?  
Use the Operating System **you are the most familiar with**.

**Location** requirements:  
Where to place imapsync?  
**Any host** in **any place** is ok for imapsync as long as it has a **network access to both IMAP servers**, the source and the destination.

- All installation files are located in the [INSTALL.d/](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/INSTALL.d/) directory.

After the imapsync installation you should go to the [documentation](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#doc) section just below.

## Documentation (back to menu)

Windows users, the [README\_Windows.txt](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/README_Windows.txt) contains essential knowledge to do your first syncs.

Unix users, the [TUTORIAL\_Unix](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/doc/TUTORIAL_Unix.html) will teach you smoothly how to do your first syncs. Windows users can read it too.

The [README](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/README) file contains general and specific pieces of information to understand imapsync and succeed in your migration or backup.

The [FAQ.d/\*](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/) files present Frequently Asked Questions (and not so frequently asked ones) and their answers. Here is the main menu, **take at least the time to read the menu**, you will certainly lose some time to read it, two minutes, but reading this menu will most likely **save you some struggling hours later**, believe me.
