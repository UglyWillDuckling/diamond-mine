A **triathlon** is an [endurance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance "Endurance") [multisport race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisport_race "Multisport race") consisting of [swimming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_\(sport\) "Swimming (sport)"), [cycling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport "Cycle sport"), and [running](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running "Running") over various distances.[^garrett-1] Triathletes compete for fastest overall completion time, racing each segment sequentially with the time transitioning between the disciplines included.[^garrett-1][^tri1012-2][^triathornreverse2-3] The word is of [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") origin, from τρεῖς (*treîs*), 'three', and ἆθλος (*âthlos*), 'competition'.[^4]

The sport originated in the late 1970s[^5] in Southern California as sports clubs and individuals developed the sport. This history has meant that [variations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Nonstandard_variations) of the sport were created and still exist. It also led to other three-stage races using the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not consisting of swim, bike, and run elements.[^twelveweek2-6]

Triathletes train to achieve endurance, strength, and speed. The sport requires focused persistent and [periodised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_periodization "Sports periodization") training for each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning.[^twelveweek-7]

1922 Course des trois sports

The evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author [Scott Tinley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Tinley "Scott Tinley"), consider events in early 20th-century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three-element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names.[^thiswas0922-8][^espn32-9] The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in [Joinville-le-Pont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joinville-le-Pont "Joinville-le-Pont"), [Val-de-Marne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val-de-Marne "Val-de-Marne"), it called itself "*Les Trois Sports*" (The Three Sports).[^10] It was advertised as an event for "the sportsmen of the time" and consisted of a run, a bicycle, and a canoe segment.[^:0-11] By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper *[L'Auto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Auto "L'Auto")*, the race consisted of a 3 km (1.9 mi) run, a 12 km (7.5 mi) bike ride, and the crossing of the river [Marne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marne_\(river\) "Marne (river)"), all staged consecutively and without a break.[^:0-11][^12][^:1-13] Throughout the 1920s, other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the *"Course des Trois Sports"* in [Marseille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille "Marseille")[^14][^15] and "La Course des Débrouillards" in [Poissy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poissy "Poissy").[^:0-11][^:1-13] These multisport events continued to slowly spread and grow in popularity; by 1934, *Les Trois Sports* was being hosted in the city of [La Rochelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle "La Rochelle"), though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a 200 m (660 ft) channel crossing, a 10 km (6 mi) bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) run in the stadium André-Barbeau.[^mechikoff-16] Throughout this growth with new events appearing, no unified rules ever existed, and as a whole, triathlon remained a minority event on the world stage.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The first modern swim/bike/run event was held at [Mission Bay, San Diego, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Bay,_San_Diego,_California "Mission Bay, San Diego, California"), on September 25, 1974.[^17] The race was conceived and directed by two members of the San Diego Track Club, Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan.[^18] Johnstone recalls that he was a part of the ['70s jogging craze in America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_boom_of_the_1970s "Running boom of the 1970s") and that after entering a few races, he was not regaining his "mediocre fitness" despite having been a member of the 1957 Collegiate and [AAU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Union "Amateur Athletic Union") All-American swim teams.[^:2-19] Then in 1973, Johnstone learned of the Dave Pain Birthday Biathlon, a 7.2 km (4.5 mi) run followed by what was billed as a quarter-mile (0.4 km) swim (the actual distance was only between 200 and 300 yards). The following year, after competing in the event for the second time and placing in the top 10, Johnstone desired more of this style of race and with equal emphasis on the swim. So, he petitioned the chairman of the San Diego Track Club, who told him he would add a race to the club calendar. The rest of the race was up to Johnstone to organise, though, and at the same time, he was to contact Don Shanahan, so there would not be too many "weird" races on the club schedule. Shanahan told Johnstone that he wanted to include a biking leg to the race; whilst hesitant, Johnstone agreed to the addition. When naming the event, the pair used the unofficially agreed naming system for multisport events, already used for [pentathlon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon "Modern pentathlon"), [heptathlon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptathlon "Heptathlon"), and [decathlon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decathlon "Decathlon"). So, they used the [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") prefix *tri* (three) for the number of events, followed by the already familiar *athlon*, hence naming the event the Mission Bay Triathlon.[^20] Neither founder had heard of the French events; both believed their race was a unique idea.[^history13-21]

On Wednesday, September 25, 1974, the race started. It began with a run of a 4.8 km (3 mi) loop, followed by biking twice around [Fiesta Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiesta_Island,_Mission_Bay "Fiesta Island, Mission Bay") for a total of 8.0 km (5 mi). Entrants would then get off the bikes, take their shoes off, and run into the water to swim to the mainland. That was followed by running in bare feet, then swimming again along the bay, then one last swim up to the entrance of Fiesta Island, and a final crawl up a steep dirt bank to finish.[^:3-22] Most participants were not skilled swimmers, so Johnstone recruited his 13-year-old son to float on his surfboard and act as lifeguard.[^:2-19][^:3-22] Some participants took longer than expected, and it began to get dark as they finished their swims. Shanahan recalls they pulled up a few cars and turned on the headlights so the athletes could see.[^23] Johnstone and Shanahan were surprised by the large number of entrants (46), mainly coming from local running clubs. Two notable entrants, Judy and John Collins, four years later founded the event that brought international attention to the new sport: the [Hawaii Ironman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_World_Championship "Ironman World Championship").[^:2-19]

The first European triathlon was held on 30 August 1980 in [Plzeň](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plze%C5%88 "Plzeň"), [Czechoslovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia"). The Netherlands, Belgium, and West Germany followed, each of them hosting an event in 1981, but media coverage of these events was almost nonexistent.[^24]

Then in 1982, event organiser [IMG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMG_\(company\) "IMG (company)"), working in partnership with the American channel CBS (direct competitor of ABC, which held the exclusive rights to Hawaii), created a new event that would take place in Europe. The initial aim was to establish a new premier competition, the European Triathlon, with the goal of being of the same size and prestige to directly compete with that of Hawaii.[^:4-25] Originally, the event was to be hosted in [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco "Monaco"), but with the death of [Princess Grace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Kelly "Grace Kelly") in September 1982, the previous agreements fell through. IMG refused to cancel the event, so it was reorganised to be hosted in [Nice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice "Nice"), France. The first [Nice Triathlon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nice_Triathlon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nice Triathlon (page does not exist)") was held on 20 November 1982, where 57 competitors took the start, for an ill-defined competition that consisted of 1,500 m (0.93 mi) of swimming, 100 km (62 mi) of cycling, and running a [marathon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_\(race\) "Marathon (race)").[^26] In December of that year the national television station [France 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_2 "France 2") broadcast a program, *Voyage au bout de la souffrance* (*Journey to the End of Suffering*) which detailed the events of the Nice Triathlon. This program introduced the sport to the general public.[^:4-25] Some fans of traditional sports strongly criticised this new practice, as seven of the entrants were hospitalised due to the swim, as the temperature of the Mediterranean was only 14 °C (57 °F).[^:4-25] Despite this criticism, IMG's plan succeeded and throughout the 1980s. The Nice Triathlon was, alongside Hawaii, one of the two important long-distance races each year for both prize money and media attention.[^27]

The year 1985 had the creation of the first international triathlon structure, the European Triathlon Union (ETU), with the objectives to federate the triathlon structures in each European country and to act as a counterbalance to American triathlon in the creation of a future worldwide federation.[^:02-28] The following year, the 11 nations that composed the ETU met in Brussels to standardise the national structures of each European country. During this time, France dominated discussions, as it was the only federation recognised by its own National Olympic Committee. With the legitimacy from CONADET, forerunner of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTri), which has been organising triathlon in France since 1984, the French system became standard all over Europe.[^:02-28]

The first attempt to create a global triathlon entity was the Triathlon Federation International (TFI), it had only 22 members, most of which were national European federations. But immediately, fights of influences broke out between the European and UK-American federations over many issues, particularly in view of a favourable vote system for the ETU; this caused immediate fracturing and the TFI never fully establish itself.[^:02-28]

Around the same time, Canadian [Les McDonald](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_McDonald_\(triathlon\) "Les McDonald (triathlon)") held talks with [Juan Antonio Samaranch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Samaranch "Juan Antonio Samaranch"), then president of the [International Olympic Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee"). Samaranch had already declared his intention to add triathlon to the Olympic Games as fast as possible, and assured that triathlon could appear as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, but only under the auspices of the [International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Internationale_de_Pentathlon_Moderne "Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne") (UIPMB).[^29][^:12-30] Many within the triathlon community were unhappy with the arrangement, wishing for their own federation not to be held as part of UIPMB. Unable to accept the offer, Samaranch established an Olympic working committee for triathlon in an effort to form a consensus on an Olympic route for the sport. McDonald was selected as president of the committee, while Sweden's Sture Jonasson was elected as secretary.[^:12-30]

Then in February 1989, an informal meeting was held in [Vancouver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver "Vancouver"), [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), where members of the working committee worked nonstop for a week on the statutes and regulations of the future [International Triathlon Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Triathlon_Union "International Triathlon Union") (ITU). Then on 1 April 1989, 30 national federations attended the first ITU Congress in [Avignon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon "Avignon"), France. After further discussions on the way forward to reach the Olympics, including the refusal to follow the path of the UIPMB and how triathlon should develop both economically and as a sport, the Congress endorsed the creation of the ITU and elected its first executive committee. McDonald was elected president. The city of Avignon was also given the honour of hosting the first world championship.[^31]

In 1991, the IOC recognized the ITU as the sole governing body for the sport of triathlon at its 97th session in [Birmingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"), UK.[^:5-32] In 1993, the [Pan American Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Games "Pan American Games") approved triathlon for competition at the 1995 Pan Am Games in [Mar del Plata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_del_Plata "Mar del Plata"), Argentina. Then in September 1994, triathlon was added to the Olympic program as a medal earning sport at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.[^:5-32]

Triathlons longer than full distance are classed as [ultra-triathlons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-triathlon "Ultra-triathlon").

Triathlons are not necessarily restricted to these prescribed distances. Distances can be any combination of distance set by race organizers to meet various distance constraints or to attract a certain type of athlete.

The standard Olympic distance of 1.5/40/10 km (0.93/24.8/6.2 miles) was created by longtime triathlon race director Jim Curl in the mid-1980s, after he and partner Carl Thomas produced the U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS) between 1982 and 1997.[^usa_hof-55]

Sprint triathlons are the most common triathlon distance in the United States. In 2022, for example, there were 839 USAT sanctioned sprint triathlons, more than all other distances combined.[^56]

In addition to the above distances, two new long-distance events have appeared, the 111 and 222 events. The 111 distance is 1 km (0.62 mi) swimming, 100 km (62 mi) bicycling and 10 km (6.2 mi) running, totalling 111 km (69 mi). The 222 distance is double that.[^57]

Most triathlons are individual events. Another format is relay triathlons, where a team of competitors take turns to compete at a race; each competitor must do a segment of swimming, cycling and running. The [World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon_Mixed_Relay_Championships "World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships") began with two separate classifications for men and women. In 2009, it adopted a 4×4 mixed relay format, where each team has two men and two women. The [triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_Youth_Olympic_Games "Triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games") also has a 4× mixed relay since 2010, and the event was introduced at the [2020 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics").

The World Triathlon accepts a 5% margin of error in the cycle and run course distances.[^58] Though there can be some variation in race distances, particularly among short triathlons, most triathlons conform to one of those above standards.

While specific rules for triathlon can vary depending on the governing body (e.g. World Triathlon, USA Triathlon), as well as for an individual race venue, there are some basic universal rules. Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.[^usat_common-65][^itu_rules-66]

Transition area (bicycles) of [Hamburg Triathlon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hamburg_Triathlon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hamburg Triathlon (page does not exist)"), 2002

Triathlons are timed in five sequential sections:

1. from the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition (swim time);
2. from the beginning of the first transition to the end of the first transition (T1 time);
3. from the start of the cycling to the end of the cycling leg (cycling time);
4. from the beginning of the second transition to the end of the second transition (T2 time);
5. finally from the start of the run to the end of the run, at which time the triathlon is completed.[^itu_rules-66]

Results are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time. Some races also post transition times separately.

Other rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below 25.6 °C (78.1 °F)),[^usat_rules-62] and prohibitions against interference between athletes.[^itu_rules-66] Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.[^usat_rules-62]

One rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor's helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions[^67]) the bike, and it must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor may not be required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification.[^usat_rules-62][^itu_rules-66] Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor's bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow.[^usat_rules-62] There are also strict rules regarding the 'bike mount' line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the [London 2012 Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_2012_Olympics "London 2012 Olympics") was imposed on [Jonathan Brownlee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Brownlee "Jonathan Brownlee"), a competitor from [Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain"), for mounting his bike too early.)[^itu_rules-66][^triathlon.org-68]

Other time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, [drafting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_\(aerodynamics\) "Drafting (aerodynamics)") on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.[^usat_rules-62][^time_penalty-69]
