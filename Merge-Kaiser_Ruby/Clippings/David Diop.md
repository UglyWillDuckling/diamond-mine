David Diop

Diop was the son of Maria Mandessi Bell (1896–1990), a member of the [Cameroonian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon "Cameroon") Bell family, of which [Rudolf Duala Manga Bell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Duala_Manga_Bell "Rudolf Duala Manga Bell") and [Ndumbe Lobe Bell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndumbe_Lobe_Bell "Ndumbe Lobe Bell"), both kings of the [Duala people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duala_people "Duala people"), were also members.[^4] He started writing poems while he was still in school, and his poems started appearing in *[Présence Africaine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9sence_Africaine "Présence Africaine")* since he was just 15.[^5] Diop lived his life transitioning constantly between France and West Africa, from childhood onwards. While in Paris, Diop became a prominent figure in Négritude literature. His work is seen as a condemnation of colonialism, and detest towards colonial rule. Like many Négritude authors of the time, Diop hoped for an independent Africa. Within the movement he was recognized as "the voice of the people without voice".[^republika-2]

He died in the crash of [Air France Flight 343](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_343 "Air France Flight 343") in the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") off [Dakar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar "Dakar"), [Senegal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal "Senegal"), at the age of 33 on 29 August 1960.[^britannica-1][^6] His one small collection of poetry, *Coups de pilon*, came out from Présence Africaine in 1956; it was posthumously published in English as *Hammer Blows*, translated and edited by Simon Mondo and Frank Jones ([African Writers Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Writers_Series "African Writers Series"), 1975).

The **Prix David Diop** is awarded in his honour by the [Association des écrivains du Sénégal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_des_%C3%A9crivains_du_S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal&action=edit&redlink=1 "Association des écrivains du Sénégal (page does not exist)").[^7][^succes-8] Winners have included [Pulchérie Abeme Nkoghe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulch%C3%A9rie_Abeme_Nkoghe "Pulchérie Abeme Nkoghe"),[^pouvoirs-9] [Papa Ibnou Sarr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papa_Ibnou_Sarr&action=edit&redlink=1 "Papa Ibnou Sarr (page does not exist)"),[^succes-8] and [Aïcha Diarra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A%C3%AFcha_Diarra&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aïcha Diarra (page does not exist)").[^10]
