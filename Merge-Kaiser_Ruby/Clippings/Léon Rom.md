**Léon Auguste Théophile Rom** (2 April 1859 – 30 January 1924) was a Belgian military officer and colonial administrator. His role in [atrocities in the Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State "Atrocities in the Congo Free State") have led some to speculate that Rom served as an inspiration for the character of [Kurtz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtz_\(Heart_of_Darkness\) "Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)") in [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad")'s 1899 novella *[Heart of Darkness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness "Heart of Darkness")*.

Léon Auguste Théophile Rom was born on 2 April 1859 to a poor family in [Mons, Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons,_Belgium "Mons, Belgium"), and joined the [Belgian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Land_Component "Belgian Land Component") at the age of 16.[^footnotehochschild2012137-1] He subsequently worked as a [customs officer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_officer "Customs officer") before leaving Belgium for the [Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State "Congo Free State") in 1886 as one of the few hundred whites working in the colony's administration.[^footnotehochschild2012137-1]

Receiving a series of rapid promotions, Rom commanded the [station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_\(frontier_defensive_structure\) "Station (frontier defensive structure)") at [Stanley Falls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyoma_Falls "Boyoma Falls") and was eventually promoted District Commissioner of [Matadi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matadi "Matadi").[^footnotehochschild2012137-1] He later transferred to the colonial military, the *[Force Publique](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Publique "Force Publique")*, where he served as a captain. He was praised for his conduct during the [Congo Arab War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Arab_War "Congo Arab War") (1892–94) in which he personally negotiated the surrender of an Arab stronghold.[^footnotehochschild2012137%e2%80%938-2] After retiring from the *Force Publique*, he worked as an official for the [Compagnie du Kasai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compagnie_du_Kasai "Compagnie du Kasai") in central Congo.[^footnotehochschild2012260-3]

Rom became most infamous for his role in [atrocities in the Congo Free State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State "Atrocities in the Congo Free State") in the Stanley Falls area. According to contemporary reports from the travel-writer and journalist [Edward James Glave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_James_Glave "Edward James Glave") written on February 21st 1895, Rom had used the severed heads of 21 Congolese, who resisted having their family members stolen, to decorate the flower beds of his house at Stanley Falls.[^4] He is also said to have kept a [gallows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows "Gallows") permanently in place at his station.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Still working for the Compagnie du Kasai, Rom died in [Brussels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels") in 1924.[^footnotehochschild2012284-5]

It has been argued that Rom served as the inspiration for the character of [Mr. Kurtz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtz_\(Heart_of_Darkness\) "Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)"), an ivory trader who features prominently in [Joseph Conrad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad")'s 1899 novella *[Heart of Darkness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness "Heart of Darkness")*. Among those who have made this argument are [Adam Hochschild](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Hochschild "Adam Hochschild") who argued in *[King Leopold's Ghost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Leopold%27s_Ghost "King Leopold's Ghost")* that Rom and Conrad may have met in 1890.[^footnotehochschild2012145%e2%80%936-6] Other scholars have rejected this.[^footnotefirchow2000112-7]

Rom notably features as the main [antagonist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist "Antagonist") in the 2016 film *[The Legend of Tarzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Tarzan_\(film\) "The Legend of Tarzan (film)")*, in which he is portrayed by the Austrian actor [Christoph Waltz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Waltz "Christoph Waltz").
