[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

Version control (also known as revision control, source control, and source code management) is the software engineering practice of controlling, organizing, and tracking different versions in history of computer files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file.

Version control is a component of software configuration management.[1]

A version control system is a software tool that automates version control. Alternatively, version control is embedded as a feature of some systems such as word processors, spreadsheets, collaborative web docs,[2] and content management systems, e.g., Wikipedia's page history.

Version control includes viewing old versions and enables reverting a file to a previous version.
