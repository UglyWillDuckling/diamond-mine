## notes 🗒

- **benchmark** table for projects pages
- GeoAPI is the new standard for using geo referential data #microservice
- `maybe` the L,S,V... info isn't important
	- it's redundant information
- daily calls are now **daily**
- there are no user roles :(

## discussion 🗨

- [x] integration env's
- [x] multi-lang support? Do we need it, should we add it just in case?
- [x] migration
	- [x] current status
	- [x] next steps regarding **infrastructure**
- [x] [[Natasa Bozic|Natasa]]: how is this page used? scenarios, use cases

### current migration status

1. show pages
2. explain implementation
3. what we will do next
4. questions/discussion
5. use cases, scenarios

## typical usage

- pre-filtered by salesman ID(last filter)
- depends on the role that is using the page
- 3 roles
- view is **restricted** depending on the roles(permission)
- ..
