**Alexander Murray Palmer Haley** (August 11, 1921 – February 10, 1992) [^1] was an American writer and the author of the 1976 book *[Roots: The Saga of an American Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family "Roots: The Saga of an American Family").*[ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company") adapted the book as a [television miniseries of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_\(1977_miniseries\) "Roots (1977 miniseries)") and aired it in 1977 to a record-breaking audience of 130 million viewers. In the United States, the book and miniseries raised the public awareness of black American history and inspired a broad interest in [genealogy and family history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy "Genealogy").[^3]

Haley's first book was *[The Autobiography of Malcolm X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X "The Autobiography of Malcolm X")*, published in 1965, a collaboration through numerous lengthy interviews with [Malcolm X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X "Malcolm X").[^4] [^5] [^6]

He was working on a second family history novel at his death. Haley had requested that [David Stevens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stevens_\(screenwriter\) "David Stevens (screenwriter)"), a screenwriter, complete it; the book was published as *[Queen: The Story of an American Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen:_The_Story_of_an_American_Family "Queen: The Story of an American Family").* It was adapted as a miniseries, *[Alex Haley's Queen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Haley%27s_Queen "Alex Haley's Queen")*, broadcast in 1993.[^7]

## Early life and education

Haley's boyhood home at Henning, Tennessee, in 2007

Alex Haley was born in [Ithaca, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York "Ithaca, New York"), on August 11, 1921, and was the eldest of three brothers (the other two being [George](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Haley "George W. Haley") and Julius) and a half-sister (from his father's second marriage). Haley lived with his family in [Henning, Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning,_Tennessee "Henning, Tennessee"), before returning to Ithaca with his family when he was five years old. Haley's father was [Simon Haley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Haley "Simon Haley"), a professor of agriculture at [Alabama A&M University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Agricultural_and_Mechanical_University "Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University"), and his mother was Bertha George Haley (née Palmer), who had grown up in Henning. The family had [Mandinka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandinka_people "Mandinka people"), other African, [Cherokee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee "Cherokee"), [Scottish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people "Scottish people"), and [Scottish-Irish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish-Irish_American "Scottish-Irish American") roots.[^8] [^9] [^10] [^11] The younger Haley always spoke proudly of his father and the obstacles of racism he had overcome.

Like his father, Alex Haley was enrolled at [Alcorn State University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcorn_State_University "Alcorn State University"), a historically black college in Mississippi and, a year later, enrolled at [Elizabeth City State College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_City_State_University "Elizabeth City State University"), also historically black, in Elizabeth City, [North Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina "North Carolina"). The following year, he withdrew from college. His father felt that Alex needed discipline and growth, and convinced him to enlist in the military. On May 24, 1939, Alex Haley began what was to become a 20-year career in the [United States Coast Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard "United States Coast Guard").[^12]

Haley traced back his maternal ancestry, through genealogical research, to [Jufureh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jufureh "Jufureh"), in [The Gambia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia "The Gambia").[^13]

Haley during his service in the [U.S. Coast Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard "United States Coast Guard")

Haley enlisted as a mess attendant. Later he was promoted to the rate of [petty officer third-class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_Officer_Third_Class "Petty Officer Third Class") in the [rating](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Rating "Naval Rating") of [steward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward%27s_assistant "Steward's assistant"), one of the few ratings open to black personnel at that time.[^14] It was during his service in the [Pacific theater of operations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War") that Haley taught himself the craft of writing stories. During his enlistment other sailors often paid him to write love letters to their girlfriends. He said that the greatest enemy he and his crew faced during their long voyages was not the Japanese forces but rather boredom.[^12]

After [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Haley petitioned the U.S. Coast Guard to allow him to transfer into the field of journalism. By 1949 he had become a [petty officer first-class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_officer,_first_class "Petty officer, first class") in the rating of a journalist. He later advanced to [chief petty officer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_petty_officer "Chief petty officer") and held this rank until his retirement from the Coast Guard in 1959. He was the first chief journalist in the Coast Guard, the rating having been expressly created for him in recognition of his literary ability.[^12]

Haley's awards and decorations from the Coast Guard include the [Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Conduct_Medal_\(United_States\) "Good Conduct Medal (United States)") (6 awards represented by 1 silver and 1 bronze [service star](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_star "Service star")), [American Defense Service Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Defense_Service_Medal "American Defense Service Medal") (with ["Sea" clasp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_clasp "Battle clasp")), [American Campaign Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Campaign_Medal "American Campaign Medal"), [Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic-Pacific_Campaign_Medal "Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal"), [European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European-African-Middle_Eastern_Campaign_Medal "European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal"), [World War II Victory Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_Victory_Medal "World War II Victory Medal"), [Korean Service Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Service_Medal "Korean Service Medal"), [National Defense Service Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Service_Medal "National Defense Service Medal"), [United Nations Service Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Service_Medal "United Nations Service Medal"), and the [Coast Guard Expert Marksmanship Medal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksmanship_Medal "Marksmanship Medal").[^12] The Republic of Korea awarded him the War Service Medal, ten years after he died. The United States Coast Guard dedicated the cutter formerly known as USS *Edenton* to Haley by recommissioning it as [USCGC *Alex Haley*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Alex_Haley "USCGC Alex Haley") in July 1999. The cutter currently serves from [Kodiak, Alaska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodiak,_Alaska "Kodiak, Alaska").

After retiring from the U.S. Coast Guard, Haley began another phase of his career in journalism. He eventually became a senior editor for *[Reader's Digest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader%27s_Digest "Reader's Digest")* magazine. Haley wrote an article for the magazine about his brother George's struggles to succeed as one of the first black students at a Southern law school.

Haley conducted the first interview for *[Playboy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy "Playboy")* magazine. Haley elicited candid comments from jazz musician [Miles Davis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis "Miles Davis") about his thoughts and feelings on racism in an interview he had started, but not finished, for *Show Business Illustrated*, another magazine created by *Playboy* founder [Hugh Hefner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hefner "Hugh Hefner") that folded in early 1962. Haley completed the interview and it appeared in *Playboy'* s September 1962 issue.[^15] That interview set the tone for what became a significant feature of the magazine. Rev. [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.")'s *Playboy* Interview with Haley was the longest he ever granted to any publication.[^16]

Throughout the 1960s, Haley was responsible for some of the magazine's most notable interviews, including one with [George Lincoln Rockwell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lincoln_Rockwell "George Lincoln Rockwell"), leader of the [American Nazi Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Nazi_Party "American Nazi Party"). He agreed to meet with Haley only after gaining assurance from the writer that he was not Jewish. Haley remained professional during the interview, although Rockwell kept a handgun on the table throughout it. (The interview was recreated in *[Roots: The Next Generations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Next_Generations "Roots: The Next Generations")*, with [James Earl Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones "James Earl Jones") as Haley and [Marlon Brando](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando "Marlon Brando") as Rockwell.) [^17] Haley also interviewed [Muhammad Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali "Muhammad Ali"), who spoke about changing his name from Cassius Clay. Other interviews include [Jack Ruby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ruby "Jack Ruby") 's defense attorney [Melvin Belli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Belli "Melvin Belli"), entertainer [Sammy Davis Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr. "Sammy Davis Jr."), football player [Jim Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Brown "Jim Brown"), TV host [Johnny Carson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Carson "Johnny Carson"), and music producer [Quincy Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones "Quincy Jones").

*[The Autobiography of Malcolm X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X "The Autobiography of Malcolm X")*, first edition (1965)

*[The Autobiography of Malcolm X](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X "The Autobiography of Malcolm X")*, published in 1965, was Haley's first book.[^18] It describes the trajectory of Malcolm X's life from street criminal to national spokesman for the [Nation of Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam "Nation of Islam") to his conversion to [Sunni Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam"). It also outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of [black pride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pride "Black pride"), [black nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_nationalism "Black nationalism"), and [pan-Africanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism "Pan-Africanism"). Haley wrote an epilogue to the book summarizing the end of Malcolm X's life, including [his assassination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Malcolm_X "Assassination of Malcolm X") in New York's [Audubon Ballroom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audubon_Ballroom "Audubon Ballroom").

Haley [ghostwrote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter "Ghostwriter") *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm X between 1963 and Malcolm X's February 1965 assassination.[^19] The two men had first met in 1960 when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for *Reader's Digest*. They met again when Haley interviewed Malcolm X for *Playboy*.[^19]

The initial interviews for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, Malcolm X spoke about [Elijah Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Muhammad "Elijah Muhammad"), the leader of the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's reminders that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm X. After several meetings, Haley asked Malcolm X to tell him something about his mother. That question drew Malcolm X into recounting his life story.[^19] [^20]

*The Autobiography of Malcolm X* has been a consistent best-seller since its 1965 publication.[^21] *[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* reported that six million copies of the book had sold by 1977.[^5] In 1998, *[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* magazine ranked *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* as one of the 10 most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.[^22]

In 1966, Haley received the [Anisfield-Wolf Book Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisfield-Wolf_Book_Award "Anisfield-Wolf Book Award") for *The Autobiography of Malcolm X*.[^23]

In 1973, Haley wrote his only screenplay, *[Super Fly T.N.T.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Fly_T.N.T. "Super Fly T.N.T.")* The film starred and was directed by [Ron O'Neal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_O%27Neal "Ron O'Neal").

*[Roots: The Saga of an American Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family "Roots: The Saga of an American Family")*, first edition (1976)

In 1976, Haley published *[Roots: The Saga of an American Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family "Roots: The Saga of an American Family")*, a novel based on his family's history, going back to slavery days. It started with the story of [Kunta Kinte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunta_Kinte "Kunta Kinte"), who was kidnapped in [The Gambia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia "The Gambia") in 1767 and transported to the [Province of Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Maryland "Province of Maryland") to be sold as a [slave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery"). Haley claimed to be a seventh-generation descendant of Kunta Kinte, and his work on the novel involved twelve years of research, intercontinental travel, and writing. He went to the village of [Juffure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juffure "Juffure"), where Kunta Kinte grew up and listened to a tribal historian ([griot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griot "Griot")) tell the story of Kinte's capture.[^1] Haley also traced the records of the ship, *[The Lord Ligonier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Ligonier_\(slave_ship\) "Lord Ligonier (slave ship)")*, which he said carried his ancestor to the Americas.[^24]

Haley stated that the most emotional moment of his life occurred on September 29, 1967, when he stood at the site in [Annapolis, Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland "Annapolis, Maryland"), where his ancestor had arrived from Africa in chains exactly 200 years before. A memorial depicting Haley reading a story to young children gathered at his feet has since been erected in the center of Annapolis.[^25]

*Roots* was eventually published in 37 languages. Haley won a [special Pulitzer Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_Special_Citations_and_Awards "Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards") for the work in 1977.[^26] The same year, *Roots* was adapted as a popular [television miniseries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_\(1977_miniseries\) "Roots (1977 miniseries)") of the same name by [ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company"). The serial reached a record-breaking 130 million viewers. *Roots* emphasized that black Americans have a long history and that not all of that history is necessarily lost, as many believed. Its popularity also sparked a greatly increased public interest in [genealogy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy "Genealogy").[^1] [^3]

In 1979, ABC aired the sequel miniseries, *[Roots: The Next Generations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Next_Generations "Roots: The Next Generations")*, which continued the story of Kunta Kinte's descendants. It concluded with Haley's travel to Juffure. Haley was portrayed at different ages by [Kristoff St. John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristoff_St._John "Kristoff St. John"), *[The Jeffersons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jeffersons "The Jeffersons")* actor [Damon Evans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Evans_\(actor\) "Damon Evans (actor)"), and [Tony Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award "Tony Award") winner [James Earl Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones "James Earl Jones"). In 2016, [History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_\(U.S._TV_channel\) "History (U.S. TV channel)") aired a [remake of the original miniseries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_\(2016_miniseries\) "Roots (2016 miniseries)"). Haley appeared briefly, portrayed by Tony Award winner [Laurence Fishburne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne "Laurence Fishburne").

Haley was briefly a "writer in residence" at [Hamilton College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_College_\(New_York\) "Hamilton College (New York)") in [Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton,_Oneida_County,_New_York "Clinton, Oneida County, New York"), New York, where he began writing *Roots*. He enjoyed spending time at a local bistro called the Savoy in nearby [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome,_New_York "Rome, New York"), where he would sometimes pass the time listening to the piano player. Today, there is a special table in honor of Haley at the Savoy, and a painting of Haley writing *Roots* on a yellow legal tablet.[^27]

*Roots* faced two lawsuits that charged plagiarism and copyright infringement. The lawsuit brought by [Margaret Walker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Walker "Margaret Walker") was dismissed, but [Harold Courlander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Courlander "Harold Courlander") 's suit was successful. Courlander's novel *The African* describes an African boy who is captured by slave traders, follows him across the Atlantic on a slave ship, and describes his attempts to hold on to his African traditions on a plantation in America. Haley admitted that some passages from *The African* had made it into *Roots*, settling the case out of court in 1978 and paying Courlander $650,000 (equivalent to $3,133,597 in 2024).[^28] [^29] In his biography of Haley, the academic Robert J. Norrell uses court transcripts and eyewitness testimony to show the judge in this trial, Nixon-appointee [Robert Ward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Joseph_Ward "Robert Joseph Ward"), not only lacked experience but was hostile to the defendant. According to an anonymous source, Judge Ward made it clear he thought Haley incapable of writing *Roots* at all.[^30]

Genealogists have also disputed Haley's research and conclusions in *Roots*. The Gambian *griot* turned out not to be a real *griot*, and the story of Kunta Kinte appears to have been a case of [circular reporting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reporting "Circular reporting"), in which Haley's own words were repeated back to him.[^31] [^32] None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the *Roots* story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but with a different genealogy than what he described in *Roots*.[^33]

Haley and his work have been excluded from the *Norton Anthology of African-American Literature*, despite his status as the United States' best-selling black author. [Harvard University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") professor [Henry Louis Gates Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_Jr. "Henry Louis Gates Jr."), one of the anthology's general editors, has denied that the controversies surrounding Haley's works are the reason for this exclusion. In 1998, Gates acknowledged the doubts surrounding Haley's claims about *Roots*, saying, "Most of us feel it's highly unlikely that Alex actually found the village whence his ancestors sprang. *Roots* is a work of the imagination rather than strict historical scholarship." [^34]

In 2023, [Jonathan Eig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Eig "Jonathan Eig") suggested that Haley had made a number of fabrications in his 1965 *[Playboy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy "Playboy")* interview with [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr."), including embellishing his criticisms of Malcolm X.[^35]

Early in the 1980s, Haley worked with [the Walt Disney Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company "The Walt Disney Company") to develop an [Equatorial Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Africa "Equatorial Africa") pavilion for its [Epcot Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot_Center "Epcot Center") theme park. Haley appeared on a [CBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") broadcast of Epcot Center's opening day celebration, discussing the plans and exhibiting concept art with host [Danny Kaye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kaye "Danny Kaye"). Ultimately, the pavilion was not built due to political and financial issues.[^36]

Late in the 1970s, Haley had begun working on a second historical novel based on another branch of his family, traced through his grandmother Queen; she was the daughter of a black slave woman and her white master.

He did not finish the novel before dying in [Seattle, Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington "Seattle, Washington"), of a heart attack on February 10, 1992.[^37] He was buried beside his childhood home in Henning, Tennessee.[^38]

At his request, the novel was finished by [David Stevens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stevens_\(screenwriter\) "David Stevens (screenwriter)") and was published as *[Alex Haley's Queen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen:_The_Story_of_an_American_Family "Queen: The Story of an American Family")* in 1993. Earlier the same year, it was adapted as a [miniseries of the same name](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Haley%27s_Queen "Alex Haley's Queen").[^39] [^40]

Late in Haley's life he had acquired a small farm in [Clinton, Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton,_Tennessee "Clinton, Tennessee"), although at the time it had a [Norris, Tennessee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris,_Tennessee "Norris, Tennessee") address. The farm is a few miles from the [Museum of Appalachia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Appalachia "Museum of Appalachia"), and Haley lived there until his death. After he died, the property was sold to the [Children's Defense Fund](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Defense_Fund "Children's Defense Fund") (CDF), which calls it the Alex Haley Farm. The nonprofit organization uses the farm as a national training center and retreat site. An abandoned [barn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn "Barn") on the farm property was rebuilt as a traditional [cantilevered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever "Cantilever") barn, using a design by architect [Maya Lin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Lin "Maya Lin"). The building now serves as a library for the CDF.[^41]
