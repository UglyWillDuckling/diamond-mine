**Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht** [^1] (10 February 1898 – 14 August 1956), known as **Bertolt Brecht** and **Bert Brecht**, was a German [theatre practitioner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_practitioner "Theatre practitioner"), playwright, and poet. Coming of age during the [Weimar Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic"), he had his first successes as a playwright in Munich and moved to Berlin in 1924, where he wrote *[The Threepenny Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera "The Threepenny Opera")* with [Elisabeth Hauptmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Hauptmann "Elisabeth Hauptmann") and [Kurt Weill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill "Kurt Weill") and began a life-long collaboration with the composer [Hanns Eisler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler "Hanns Eisler"). Immersed in [Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") thought during this period, Brecht wrote didactic *[Lehrstücke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehrst%C3%BCcke "Lehrstücke")* and became a leading theoretician of [epic theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theatre "Epic theatre") (which he later preferred to call "dialectical theatre") and the *[Verfremdungseffekt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verfremdungseffekt "Verfremdungseffekt")*.

When the [Nazis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party "Nazi Party") came to power in Germany in 1933, Brecht fled his home country, initially to Scandinavia. During [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") he moved to [Southern California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California "Southern California") where he established himself as a screenwriter, while also being surveilled by the [FBI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI").<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillett1990312%E2%80%93313-3"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1947, he was part of the first group of Hollywood film artists to be subpoenaed by the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee") for alleged Communist Party affiliations.[^4] The day after testifying, he returned to Europe, eventually settling in [East Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin") where he co-founded the theatre company [Berliner Ensemble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Ensemble "Berliner Ensemble") with his wife and long-time collaborator, actress [Helene Weigel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Weigel "Helene Weigel").[^5]

Brecht's birthplace in Augsburg

Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht (as a child known as Eugen) was born on 10 February 1898 in [Augsburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg "Augsburg"), Germany, the son of Berthold Friedrich Brecht (1869–1939) and his wife Sophie, née Brezing (1871–1920). Brecht's mother was a devout [Protestant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") and his father a [Roman Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") (who had been persuaded to have a Protestant wedding). The modest house where he was born is today preserved as a Brecht Museum.[^6] His father worked for a paper mill, becoming its managing director in 1914.[^7] At Augsburg, his maternal grandparents lived in the neighbouring house. They were [Pietists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietists "Pietists") and his grandmother influenced Bertolt Brecht and his brother [Walter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Brecht "Walter Brecht") considerably during their childhood.

Due to his grandmother's and his mother's influence, Brecht knew the Bible, a familiarity that would have a life-long effect on his writing. From his mother came the "dangerous image of the self-denying woman" that recurs in his drama.[^8] Brecht's home life was comfortably middle class, despite what his occasional attempt to claim peasant origins implied.[^9] At school in Augsburg he met [Caspar Neher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Neher "Caspar Neher"), with whom he formed a life-long creative partnership. Neher designed many of the sets for Brecht's dramas and helped to forge the distinctive visual iconography of their [epic theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theatre "Epic theatre").

When Brecht was 16, [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") broke out. Initially enthusiastic, Brecht soon changed his mind on seeing his classmates "swallowed by the army".[^7] Brecht was nearly expelled from school in 1915 for writing an essay in response to the line *[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_et_decorum_est_pro_patria_mori "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori")* from the Roman poet [Horace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace"), calling it *Zweckpropaganda* ("cheap propaganda for a specific purpose") and arguing that only an empty-headed person could be persuaded to die for their country. His expulsion was only prevented by the intervention of Romuald Sauer, a priest who also served as a substitute teacher at Brecht's school.[^10]

On his father's recommendation, Brecht sought to avoid being conscripted into the army by exploiting a loophole which allowed for medical students to be deferred. He subsequently registered for a medical course at [Munich University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"), where he enrolled in 1917.[^11] There he studied drama with [Arthur Kutscher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kutscher "Arthur Kutscher"), who inspired in the young Brecht an admiration for the iconoclastic dramatist and [cabaret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret "Cabaret") star [Frank Wedekind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wedekind "Frank Wedekind").[^12]

From July 1916, Brecht's newspaper articles began appearing under the new name "Bert Brecht" (his first theatre criticism for the *[Augsburger Volkswille](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Volkswille_\(Augsburg,_1919\) "Der Volkswille (Augsburg, 1919)")* appeared in October 1919).[^13] Brecht was [drafted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") into military service in the autumn of 1918, only to be posted back to Augsburg as a medical orderly in a military [VD clinic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_health_clinic "Sexual health clinic"); the war ended a month later.[^7]

In July 1919, Brecht and [Paula Banholzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Banholzer "Paula Banholzer") (who had begun a relationship in 1917) had a son, Frank. Frank died in 1943, as a [Wehrmacht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht "Wehrmacht") conscript on the [Eastern Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\) "Eastern Front (World War II)").[^14] In 1920 Brecht's mother died.[^15]

Some time in either 1920 or 1921, Brecht took a small part in the political cabaret of the Munich comedian [Karl Valentin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Valentin "Karl Valentin").[^16] Brecht's diaries for the next few years record numerous visits to see Valentin perform.[^17] Brecht compared Valentin to [Charlie Chaplin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin "Charlie Chaplin"), for his "virtually complete rejection of mimicry and cheap psychology".[^18] Writing in his *[Messingkauf Dialogues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messingkauf_Dialogues "Messingkauf Dialogues")* years later, Brecht identified Valentin, along with Wedekind and [Büchner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_B%C3%BCchner "Georg Büchner"), as his "chief influences" at that time:

> But the man he learnt most from was the clown *Valentin*, who performed in a beer-hall. He did short sketches in which he played refractory employees, orchestral musicians or photographers, who hated their employers and made them look ridiculous. The employer was played by his partner, Liesl Karlstadt, a popular woman comedian who used to pad herself out and speak in a deep bass voice.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrecht196569%E2%80%9370-19"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>

Brecht's first full-length play, *[Baal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_\(play\) "Baal (play)")* (written 1918), arose in response to an argument in one of Kutscher's drama seminars, initiating a trend that persisted throughout his career of creative activity that was generated by a desire to counter another work (both others' and his own, as his many adaptations and re-writes attest). "Anyone can be creative," he quipped, "it's rewriting other people that's a challenge." [^20] Brecht completed his second major play, *[Drums in the Night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums_in_the_Night "Drums in the Night")*, in February 1919.

Between November 1921 and April 1922 Brecht made acquaintance with many influential people in the Berlin cultural scene. Amongst them was the playwright [Arnolt Bronnen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolt_Bronnen "Arnolt Bronnen") with whom he established a joint venture, the Arnolt Bronnen / Bertolt Brecht Company. Brecht changed the spelling of his first name to Bertolt to rhyme with Arnolt.

In 1922 while still living in Munich, Brecht came to the attention of an influential Berlin critic, [Herbert Ihering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ihering "Herbert Ihering"): "At 24 the writer Bert Brecht has changed Germany's literary complexion overnight"—he enthused in his review of Brecht's first play to be produced, *Drums in the Night* —"\[he\] has given our time a new tone, a new melody, a new vision. \[...\] It is a language you can feel on your tongue, in your gums, your ear, your spinal column." [^21] In November it was announced that Brecht had been awarded the prestigious [Kleist Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleist_Prize "Kleist Prize") (intended for unestablished writers and probably Germany's most significant literary award, until it was abolished in 1932) for his first three plays (*Baal*, *Drums in the Night*, and *[In the Jungle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Jungle_of_Cities "In the Jungle of Cities")*, although at that point only *Drums* had been produced).[^22] The citation for the award insisted that: "\[Brecht's\] language is vivid without being deliberately poetic, symbolical without being over literary. Brecht is a dramatist because his language is felt physically and in the round." [^23] That year he married the Viennese opera singer [Marianne Zoff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Zoff "Marianne Zoff"). Their daughter, [Hanne Hiob](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanne_Hiob "Hanne Hiob"), born in March 1923, was a successful German actress.[^7]

In 1923, Brecht wrote a scenario for what was to become a short [slapstick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapstick "Slapstick") film, *[Mysteries of a Barbershop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysteries_of_a_Barbershop "Mysteries of a Barbershop")*, directed by [Erich Engel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Engel "Erich Engel") and starring Karl Valentin.[^24] Despite a lack of success at the time, its experimental inventiveness and the subsequent success of many of its contributors have meant that it is now considered one of the most important films in [German film history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Germany "Cinema of Germany"). In May of that year, Brecht's *In the Jungle* premiered in Munich, also directed by Engel. Opening night proved to be a "scandal"—a phenomenon that would characterize many of his later productions during the [Weimar Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") —in which [Nazis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") blew whistles and threw stink bombs at the actors on the stage.[^17]

In 1924 Brecht worked with the novelist and playwright [Lion Feuchtwanger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Feuchtwanger "Lion Feuchtwanger") (whom he had met in 1919) on an adaptation of [Christopher Marlowe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe "Christopher Marlowe") 's *[Edward II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_\(play\) "Edward II (play)")* that proved to be a milestone in Brecht's early theatrical and dramaturgical development.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThomson199426%E2%80%9327-26"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeech199454%E2%80%9355-27"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> Brecht's *[Edward II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Edward_II_of_England "The Life of Edward II of England")* constituted his first attempt at collaborative writing and was the first of many classic texts he was to adapt. As his first solo directorial début, he later credited it as the germ of his conception of " [epic theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theatre "Epic theatre") ".[^27] That September, a job as assistant [dramaturg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturge "Dramaturge") at [Max Reinhardt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Reinhardt "Max Reinhardt") 's [Deutsches Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Theater_\(Berlin\) "Deutsches Theater (Berlin)") —at the time one of the leading three or four theatres in the world—brought him to Berlin.[^28]

In 1923 Brecht's marriage to Zoff began to break down (though they did not divorce until 1927).[^29] Brecht had become involved with both [Elisabeth Hauptmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Hauptmann "Elisabeth Hauptmann") and Helene Weigel.[^30] Brecht and Weigel's son, [Stefan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Brecht "Stefan Brecht"), was born in October 1924.[^31]

In his role as dramaturg, Brecht had much to stimulate him but little work of his own.[^32] Reinhardt staged [Shaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "George Bernard Shaw") 's *[Saint Joan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joan_\(play\) "Saint Joan (play)")*, [Goldoni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Goldoni "Carlo Goldoni") 's *[Servant of Two Masters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_Two_Masters "Servant of Two Masters")* (with the improvisational approach of the *[commedia dell'arte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte "Commedia dell'arte")* in which the actors chatted with the prompter about their roles), and [Pirandello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Pirandello "Luigi Pirandello") 's *[Six Characters in Search of an Author](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Characters_in_Search_of_an_Author "Six Characters in Search of an Author")* in his group of Berlin theatres.[^33] A new version of Brecht's third play, now entitled *[Jungle: Decline of a Family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Jungle_of_Cities "In the Jungle of Cities")*, opened at the Deutsches Theater in October 1924, but was not a success.[^34]

> In the asphalt city I'm at home. From the very start  
> Provided with every last sacrament:  
> With newspapers. And tobacco. And brandy  
> To the end mistrustful, lazy and content.

Bertolt Brecht, "Of Poor BB"

At this time Brecht revised his important "transitional poem", "Of Poor BB".[^35] In 1925, his publishers provided him with Elisabeth Hauptmann as an assistant for the completion of his collection of poems, *Devotions for the Home* (*[Hauspostille](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brechts_Hauspostille "de:Bertolt Brechts Hauspostille")*, eventually published in January 1927). She continued to work with him after the publisher's commission ran out.[^36]

In 1925 in [Mannheim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannheim "Mannheim") the artistic exhibition *Neue Sachlichkeit* (" [New Objectivity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity "New Objectivity") ") had given its name to the new post- [Expressionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism "Expressionism") movement in the German arts. With little to do at the Deutsches Theater, Brecht began to develop his *[Man Equals Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Equals_Man "Man Equals Man")* project, which was to become the first product of "the 'Brecht collective'—that shifting group of friends and collaborators on whom he henceforward depended." [^37] This collaborative approach to artistic production, together with aspects of Brecht's writing and style of theatrical production, mark Brecht's work from this period as part of the *Neue Sachlichkeit* movement.[^38] The collective's work "mirrored the artistic climate of the middle 1920s", [Willett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willett "John Willett") and [Manheim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Manheim "Ralph Manheim") argue:

> with their attitude of *Neue Sachlichkeit* (or New Matter-of-Factness), their stressing of the collectivity and downplaying of the individual, and their new cult of [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon "Anglo-Saxon") imagery and sport. Together the "collective" would go to fights, not only absorbing their terminology and ethos (which permeates *Man Equals Man*) but also drawing those conclusions for the theatre as a whole which Brecht set down in his theoretical essay "Emphasis on Sport" and tried to realise by means of the harsh lighting, the boxing-ring stage and other anti-illusionistic devices that henceforward appeared in his own productions.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillettManheim1970viii%E2%80%93ix-40"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>

In 1925, Brecht saw two films that had a significant influence on him: [Chaplin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin "Charlie Chaplin") 's *[The Gold Rush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold_Rush "The Gold Rush")* and [Eisenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein "Sergei Eisenstein") 's *[Battleship Potemkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_Potemkin "Battleship Potemkin")*.[^40] Brecht had compared [Valentin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Valentin "Karl Valentin") to Chaplin, and the two of them provided models for Galy Gay in *Man Equals Man*.[^41] Brecht later wrote that Chaplin "would in many ways come closer to the [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_\(acting\) "Demonstration (acting)") than to the dramatic theatre's requirements." [^42] They met several times during Brecht's time in the United States, and discussed Chaplin's *[Monsieur Verdoux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Verdoux "Monsieur Verdoux")* project, which it is possible Brecht influenced.[^43]

In 1926 a series of short stories was published under Brecht's name, though Hauptmann was closely associated with writing them.[^44] Following the production of *Man Equals Man* in Darmstadt that year, Brecht began studying [Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") and socialism in earnest, under the supervision of Hauptmann.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThomson199428%E2%80%9329-46"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> "When I read [Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") 's *[Capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital "Das Kapital")* ", a note by Brecht reveals, "I understood my plays." Marx was, it continues, "the only spectator for my plays I'd ever come across." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrecht196423%E2%80%9324-47"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> Inspired by the developments in [USSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR"), Brecht wrote a number of [agitprop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agitprop "Agitprop") plays, praising the [bolshevik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik "Bolshevik") [collectivism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_collectivism "Soviet collectivism") (replaceability of each member of the collective in *Man Equals Man*) and the [Red Terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror "Red Terror") ([*The Decision*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_\(play\) "The Decision (play)")).

> For us, man portrayed on the stage is significant as a social function. It is not his relationship to himself, nor his relationship to God, but his relationship to society which is central. Whenever he appears, his class or social stratum appears with him. His moral, spiritual or sexual conflicts are conflicts with society.

In 1927 Brecht became part of the " [dramaturgical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturge "Dramaturge") collective" of [Erwin Piscator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Piscator "Erwin Piscator") 's first company, which was designed to tackle the problem of finding new plays for its "epic, political, confrontational, documentary theatre".[^48] Brecht collaborated with Piscator during the period of the latter's landmark productions, *[Hoppla, We're Alive!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoppla,_We%27re_Alive! "Hoppla, We're Alive!")* by [Toller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Toller "Ernst Toller"), *Rasputin*, *[The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Soldier_%C5%A0vejk "The Good Soldier Švejk")*, and *Konjunktur* by [Lania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9o_Lania "Léo Lania").[^49] Brecht's most significant contribution was to the adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic novel *Schweik*, which he later described as a "montage from the novel".[^50] The Piscator productions influenced Brecht's ideas about staging and design, and alerted him to the radical potentials offered to the " [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_drama "Non-Aristotelian drama") " playwright by the development of stage technology (particularly projections).[^51] What Brecht took from Piscator "is fairly plain, and he acknowledged it" Willett suggests:

> The emphasis on Reason and didacticism, the sense that the new subject matter demanded a [new dramatic form](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_drama "Non-Aristotelian drama"), the use of songs to [interrupt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interruptions_\(epic_theatre\) "Interruptions (epic theatre)") and comment: all these are found in his notes and essays of the 1920s, and he bolstered them by citing such Piscatorial examples as the step-by-step narrative technique of *Schweik* and the oil interests handled in *Konjunktur* ('Petroleum resists the five-act form').[^52]

Brecht was struggling at the time with the question of how to dramatize the complex economic relationships of modern capitalism in his unfinished project *Joe P. Fleischhacker* (which Piscator's theatre announced in its programme for the 1927–28 season). It wasn't until his *[Saint Joan of the Stockyards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joan_of_the_Stockyards "Saint Joan of the Stockyards")* (written between 1929 and 1931) that Brecht solved it.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillett1998104%E2%80%93105-54"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1928 he discussed with Piscator plans to stage [Shakespeare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") 's *[Julius Caesar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_\(play\) "Julius Caesar (play)")* and Brecht's own *[Drums in the Night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums_in_the_Night "Drums in the Night")*, but the productions did not materialize.[^54]

The year 1927 also saw the first collaboration between Brecht and the young composer [Kurt Weill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill "Kurt Weill").[^55] Together they began to develop Brecht's *[Mahagonny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_and_Fall_of_the_City_of_Mahagonny "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny")* project, along thematic lines of the biblical [Cities of the Plain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah "Sodom and Gomorrah") but rendered in terms of the *[Neue Sachlichkeit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity "New Objectivity") '* s *Amerikanismus*, which had informed Brecht's previous work.[^56] They produced *[The Little Mahagonny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahagonny-Songspiel "Mahagonny-Songspiel")* for a music festival in July, as what Weill called a "stylistic exercise" in preparation for the large-scale piece. From that point on [Caspar Neher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Neher "Caspar Neher") became an integral part of the collaborative effort, with words, music and visuals conceived in relation to one another from the start.[^57] The model for their mutual articulation lay in Brecht's newly formulated principle of the " [separation of the elements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_the_elements "Separation of the elements") ", which he first outlined in " [The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Theatre_Is_the_Epic_Theatre "The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre") " (1930). The principle, a variety of [montage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory "Soviet montage theory"), proposed by-passing the "great struggle for supremacy between words, music and production" as Brecht put it, by showing each as self-contained, independent works of art that [adopt attitudes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestus "Gestus") towards one another.[^58]

In 1930 Brecht married Weigel; their daughter Barbara Brecht was born soon after the wedding.[^59] She also became an actress and would later share the [copyrights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") of Brecht's work with her siblings.

Brecht formed a writing collective which became prolific and very influential. [Elisabeth Hauptmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Hauptmann "Elisabeth Hauptmann"), [Margarete Steffin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarete_Steffin "Margarete Steffin"), Emil Burri, [Ruth Berlau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Berlau "Ruth Berlau") and others worked with Brecht and produced the multiple [teaching plays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehrst%C3%BCcke "Lehrstücke"), which attempted to create a new [dramaturgy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy "Dramaturgy") for participants rather than passive audiences. These addressed themselves to the massive worker arts organisation that existed in Germany and Austria in the 1920s. So did Brecht's first great play, *[Saint Joan of the Stockyards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joan_of_the_Stockyards "Saint Joan of the Stockyards")*, which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions.

This collective adapted [John Gay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gay "John Gay") 's *[The Beggar's Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beggar%27s_Opera "The Beggar's Opera")*, with Brecht's lyrics set to music by [Kurt Weill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill "Kurt Weill"). Retitled *[The Threepenny Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera "The Threepenny Opera")* (*Die Dreigroschenoper*) it was the biggest hit in Berlin of the 1920s and a renewing influence on the musical worldwide. One of its most famous lines underscored the hypocrisy of conventional morality imposed by the Church, working in conjunction with the established order, in the face of working-class hunger and deprivation:

| Erst kommt das Fressen   Dann kommt die Moral. | First the grub (lit.' eating like animals, gorging ')   Then the morality. |
| --- | --- |

The success of *The Threepenny Opera* was followed by the quickly thrown together *Happy End*. It was a personal and a commercial failure. At the time the book was purported to be by the mysterious Dorothy Lane (now known to be Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht's secretary and close collaborator). Brecht only claimed authorship of the song texts. Brecht would later use elements of *Happy End* as the germ for his *Saint Joan of the Stockyards*, a play that would never see the stage in Brecht's lifetime. *Happy End'* s score by Weill produced many Brecht/Weill hits like "Der Bilbao-Song" and "Surabaya-Jonny".

The masterpiece of the Brecht/Weill collaborations, *[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_and_Fall_of_the_City_of_Mahagonny "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny")* (*Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny*), caused an uproar when it premiered in 1930 in Leipzig, with Nazis in the audience protesting. The *Mahagonny* opera would premier later in Berlin in 1931 as a triumphant sensation.

Brecht spent the last years of the [Weimar-era](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") (1930–1933) in Berlin working with his "collective" on the *Lehrstücke*. These were a group of plays driven by morals, music and Brecht's budding epic theatre. The *Lehrstücke* often aimed at educating workers on Socialist issues. *[The Measures Taken](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_\(play\) "The Decision (play)")* (*Die Massnahme*) was scored by [Hanns Eisler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler "Hanns Eisler"). In addition, Brecht worked on a script for a semi-documentary feature film about the human impact of mass unemployment, *[Kuhle Wampe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhle_Wampe "Kuhle Wampe")* (1932), which was directed by [Slatan Dudow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slatan_Dudow "Slatan Dudow"). This striking film is notable for its subversive humour, outstanding [cinematography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography "Cinematography") by [Günther Krampf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Krampf "Günther Krampf"), and Hanns Eisler's dynamic musical contribution. It still provides a vivid insight into Berlin during the last years of the [Weimar Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic").

[Galileo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), in Brecht's *[Life of Galileo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Galileo "Life of Galileo")* ([1943](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943_in_literature#New_drama "1943 in literature"))

Fearing persecution, Brecht fled [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") in February 1933, just after [Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") took power. Following brief spells in Prague, Zurich and Paris, he and Weigel accepted an invitation from journalist and author [Karin Michaëlis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karin_Micha%C3%ABlis "Karin Michaëlis") to move to Denmark. The Brechts first stayed with Michaëlis at her house on the small island of [Thurø](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thur%C3%B8 "Thurø") close to the island of [Funen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funen "Funen").[^60] They later bought their own house in [Svendborg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svendborg "Svendborg") on Funen. This Svendborg house at Skovsbo Strand 8 became the Brecht family residence for the next six years.[^61] They often received guests there including [Walter Benjamin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin "Walter Benjamin"), [Hanns Eisler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler "Hanns Eisler") and [Ruth Berlau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Berlau "Ruth Berlau"). Brecht also travelled frequently to Copenhagen, Paris, Moscow, New York and London for various projects and collaborations.

When war seemed imminent in April 1939, he moved to Stockholm, where he remained for a year.[^62] After [Germany invaded Norway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_campaign "Norwegian campaign") and [Denmark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_Denmark_\(1940\) "German invasion of Denmark (1940)"), Brecht left Sweden for Helsinki, Finland,[^63] where he awaited a pending visa to the United States.[^64] During this time he co-wrote the play *[Mr Puntila and His Man Matti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Puntila_and_His_Man_Matti "Mr Puntila and His Man Matti")* (*Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti*) with [Hella Wuolijoki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hella_Wuolijoki "Hella Wuolijoki"), with whom he lived in the Marlebäck manor house in [Iitti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iitti "Iitti").

Brecht's house in [Santa Monica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica "Santa Monica"), 1063 26th Street (2014)

Upon receipt of the U.S. visa in May 1941, the Brecht family relocated to [Southern California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California "Southern California").[^64] They rented a two-story wooden bungalow in the [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") beach suburb of [Santa Monica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California "Santa Monica, California").[^65] By the late 1930s, the West Side of Los Angeles had become a thriving expatriate colony of European intellectuals and artists. Because the colony included so many writers, directors, actors, and composers from German-speaking countries, it has been referred to as "Weimar on the Pacific".[^66]

At the center of the émigré community was Brecht's old friend [Salka Viertel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salka_Viertel "Salka Viertel"), whom he had known in the Berlin theatre world of the 1920s.<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEViertel1969100%E2%80%93101-68"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> From her house in Santa Monica Canyon, Viertel hosted frequent tea parties and [salons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_\(gathering\) "Salon (gathering)") where European intellectuals could mingle with Hollywood luminaries.[^68] Brecht first met actor [Charles Laughton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Laughton "Charles Laughton") at a Viertel party, and it led to the two men collaborating on the English-language version of *[Life of Galileo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Galileo "Life of Galileo")*.[^69]

Although Brecht was not enamored of life in the movie capital,[^70] he worked hard to find a place for himself as a screenwriter.[^69] He co-wrote the screenplay for the [Fritz Lang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Lang "Fritz Lang") -directed film *[Hangmen Also Die!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangmen_Also_Die! "Hangmen Also Die!")* (1943) which was loosely based on the 1942 assassination of [Reinhard Heydrich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich "Reinhard Heydrich"), the Nazi Deputy Reich Protector of the German-occupied [Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia"). Heydrich had been [Heinrich Himmler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler "Heinrich Himmler") 's right-hand man in the [SS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel "Schutzstaffel") and a chief architect of the [Holocaust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust"); he was known as "The Hangman of Prague" ([German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): *der Henker von Prag*).[^71] For this film, Brecht's fellow expatriate, composer [Hanns Eisler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler "Hanns Eisler"), was nominated for an [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award "Academy Award") in the category of [Best Music Score](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score "Academy Award for Best Original Score"). The fact that three refugee artists from Nazi Germany – Lang, Brecht and Eisler – collaborated to make the film exemplified the influence this generation of German exiles had on American culture. *Hangmen Also Die!* turned out to be Brecht's only script that became a Hollywood film. The money he earned from selling the script enabled him to write *[The Visions of Simone Machard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Visions_of_Simone_Machard "The Visions of Simone Machard")*, *[Schweik in the Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweik_in_the_Second_World_War "Schweik in the Second World War")* and an adaptation of [Webster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Webster "John Webster") 's *[The Duchess of Malfi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Malfi_\(Brecht\) "The Duchess of Malfi (Brecht)")*.[^64]

During the reign of the [Third Reich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reich "Third Reich"), Brecht was a prominent practitioner of the [Exilliteratur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exilliteratur "Exilliteratur"). He expressed his opposition to the [National Socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") and [Fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_in_Europe "Fascism in Europe") movements in his famous plays: *[Life of Galileo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Galileo "Life of Galileo")*, *[Mother Courage and Her Children](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Courage_and_Her_Children "Mother Courage and Her Children")*, *[The Good Person of Szechwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Person_of_Szechwan "The Good Person of Szechwan")*, *[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui")*, *[The Caucasian Chalk Circle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caucasian_Chalk_Circle "The Caucasian Chalk Circle")*, *[Fear and Misery of the Third Reich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Misery_of_the_Third_Reich "Fear and Misery of the Third Reich")*, and many others. However, his refusal to speak in support of [Carola Neher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carola_Neher "Carola Neher"), who died in the [Gulag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag "Gulag") after being arrested during [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") 's [Great Purge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge"), was harshly criticised by [Russian émigrés](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_%C3%A9migr%C3%A9 "White émigré") living in the West.[^72]

At the onset of the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") and " [Second Red Scare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Red_Scare "Second Red Scare") " in the U.S., Brecht was [blacklisted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist "Hollywood blacklist") by movie studio bosses and investigated by the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee") (HUAC).[^73] Along with more than 40 other Hollywood writers, directors, actors and producers, he was subpoenaed in September 1947 by the HUAC. Although he was one of the 19 "unfriendly" witnesses who had declared ahead of time they would not cooperate with the House investigation, Brecht eventually decided to go before the committee and answer questions.[^74] He later explained he was following the advice of attorneys and did not want to delay his planned trip to Europe.

On 30 October 1947, Brecht testified to the HUAC that he had never been a member of the [Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party "Communist Party").[^73] He made wry jokes throughout the proceedings, punctuating his inability to speak English well with continuous references to the translators present, who transformed his German statements into English ones unintelligible to himself. HUAC vice-chairman [Karl Mundt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Mundt "Karl Mundt") thanked Brecht for his cooperation.[^75] The remaining unfriendly witnesses who appeared before the HUAC at that time, the so-called [Hollywood Ten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist#Hollywood_Ten_and_beyond "Hollywood blacklist"), declined on [First Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "First Amendment to the United States Constitution") grounds to answer about their Communist Party affiliations and were cited for contempt. Brecht's decision to be a "cooperative" witness—albeit in an evasive way and providing no useful information—led to criticism of him, including accusations of betrayal. The day after his testimony, Brecht fled to Europe and never returned to the U.S.

He lived in [Zurich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich"), Switzerland, for a year. In February 1948 in the Swiss town of [Chur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chur "Chur"), Brecht staged an adaptation of [Sophocles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles "Sophocles") ' *[Antigone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_\(Sophocles\) "Antigone (Sophocles)")*, based on a translation by [Hölderlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_H%C3%B6lderlin "Friedrich Hölderlin"). The play was published under the title *Antigonemodell 1948*, accompanied by an essay on the importance of creating a " [non-Aristotelian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_drama "Non-Aristotelian drama") " form of theatre.

In 1949 he moved to [East Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin") and established his theatre company there, the [Berliner Ensemble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Ensemble "Berliner Ensemble"). He retained [Austrian nationality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_nationality_law "Austrian nationality law") which was granted in 1950, and his overseas bank accounts from which he received valuable hard currency remittances. The copyrights on his writings were held by a Swiss company.[^76]

Brecht and Weigel on the roof of the [Berliner Ensemble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Ensemble "Berliner Ensemble") during the [International Workers' Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day "International Workers' Day") demonstrations in 1954

Though he was never a member of the Communist Party, Brecht had been schooled in [Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") by the dissident communist [Karl Korsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Korsch "Karl Korsch"). Korsch's version of the [Marxist dialectic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Marxist_dialectic "Dialectic") influenced Brecht greatly, both his aesthetic theory and theatrical practice. Brecht received the [Stalin Peace Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin_Peace_Prize "Stalin Peace Prize") in 1954.[^77] His proximity to Marxist thought made him controversial in Austria, where his plays were [boycotted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecht_boycott_in_Vienna "Brecht boycott in Vienna") by directors and not performed for more than ten years.

Brecht wrote very few plays in his final years in East Berlin, none of them as famous as his previous works. He dedicated himself to directing plays and developing the talents of the next generation of young directors and dramaturgs, such as Manfred Wekwerth, [Benno Besson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benno_Besson "Benno Besson") and [Carl Weber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Weber_\(theatre_director\) "Carl Weber (theatre director)"). At this time he wrote some of his most celebrated poems, including the *[Buckow Elegies](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckower_Elegien "de:Buckower Elegien")*.

At first, Brecht apparently supported the measures taken by the East German government against the [East German uprising of 1953](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_German_uprising_of_1953 "East German uprising of 1953"), which included the use of Soviet military force. In a letter from the day of the uprising to [SED](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany "Socialist Unity Party of Germany") First Secretary [Walter Ulbricht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Ulbricht "Walter Ulbricht"), Brecht wrote: "History will pay its respects to the revolutionary impatience of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The great discussion \[exchange\] with the masses about the speed of socialist construction will lead to a viewing and safeguarding of the socialist achievements. At this moment I must assure you of my allegiance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany." [^78]

Brecht's subsequent commentary on those events, however, offered a very different assessment. In one of the poems in the *Elegies*, " [Die Lösung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6sung "Die Lösung") " (The Solution), a disillusioned Brecht wrote a few months later:

> After the uprising of the [17th of June](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_German_uprising_of_1953 "East German uprising of 1953")  
> The Secretary of the [Writers Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Schriftstellerverband "Deutscher Schriftstellerverband")  
> Had leaflets distributed in the [Stalinallee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinallee "Stalinallee")  
> Stating that the people  
> Had forfeited the confidence of the government  
> And could win it back only  
> By increased work quotas.  
>   
> Would it not be easier  
> In that case for the government  
> To dissolve the people  
> And elect another?[^79]

Brecht's involvement in [agitprop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agitprop "Agitprop") and his lack of clear condemnation of purges resulted in criticism from many contemporaries who became disillusioned with communism earlier. [Fritz Raddatz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_J._Raddatz "Fritz J. Raddatz"), who knew Brecht for a long time, described his friend's attitude as "broken", "escaping the problem of Stalinism", ignoring his friends being murdered in the USSR, and keeping silent during [show trials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_trials_in_the_Soviet_Union "Show trials in the Soviet Union") such as the [Slánský trial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sl%C3%A1nsk%C3%BD_trial "Slánský trial").[^80]

After Khrushchev's " [Secret Speech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Cult_of_Personality_and_Its_Consequences "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences") "—the report read on the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which brought the crimes of Stalinism to the public—Brecht wrote poems critical of Stalin and his cult, unpublished during Brecht's lifetime. In the best-known of them, "The Tsar Spoke to Them" (*Der Zar hat mit ihnen gesprochen*),[^81] [^82] Brecht mocked the epithets applied to Stalin as "the honoured murderer of the people" [^83] and compared his state terror policies with the ones of the Russian Tsar [Nicholas II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II"), famous for violent suppression of a peaceful demonstration on " [Bloody Sunday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_\(1905\) "Bloody Sunday (1905)") " and later protests which resulted in the [Russian Revolution of 1905](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905 "Russian Revolution of 1905").[^82]

Graves of Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht in the [Dorotheenstadt Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorotheenstadt_Cemetery "Dorotheenstadt Cemetery")

Brecht died on 14 August 1956 [^85] of a heart attack at the age of 58. He is buried in the [Dorotheenstadt Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorotheenstadt_Cemetery "Dorotheenstadt Cemetery") on [Chausseestraße](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chausseestra%C3%9Fe "Chausseestraße") in the [Mitte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitte "Mitte") neighbourhood of Berlin, overlooked by the residence he shared with Helene Weigel.

According to Stephen Parker, who reviewed Brecht's writings and unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted [rheumatic fever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever "Rheumatic fever") as a child, which led to an [enlarged heart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlarged_heart "Enlarged heart"), followed by life-long chronic heart failure and [Sydenham's chorea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydenham%27s_chorea "Sydenham's chorea"). A report of a [radiograph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiograph "Radiograph") taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding [aortic knob](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_knob "Aortic knob") and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues characterized him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with [emotional lability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_lability "Emotional lability"), personality changes, [obsessive-compulsive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive "Obsessive-compulsive") behavior, and [hyperactivity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity "Hyperactivity"), which matched Brecht's behavior. "What is remarkable," wrote Parker, "is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, [arrhythmia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia "Arrhythmia") into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama." [^86]

Brecht developed the combined theory and practice of his [epic theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theatre "Epic theatre") movement by synthesizing and extending the experiments of [Erwin Piscator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Piscator "Erwin Piscator") and [Vsevolod Meyerhold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsevolod_Meyerhold "Vsevolod Meyerhold") to explore the theatre as a [forum for political ideas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_drama "Political drama") and the creation of a critical aesthetics of [dialectical materialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism "Dialectical materialism").

Epic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the characters or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage. Brecht thought that the experience of a [climactic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_\(narrative\) "Climax (narrative)") [catharsis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis "Catharsis") of emotion left an audience complacent. Instead, he wanted his audiences to adopt a critical perspective in order to recognize social injustice and exploitation and to be moved to go forth from the theatre and effect change in the world outside.[^87] For this purpose, Brecht employed the use of techniques that remind the spectator that the play is a [representation of reality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatheatre "Metatheatre") and not reality itself. By highlighting the constructed nature of the theatrical event, Brecht hoped to communicate that the audience's reality was equally constructed, and as such, was changeable.

Brecht's [modernist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism") concern with drama-as-a- [medium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_specificity "Medium specificity") led to his refinement of the " [epic form](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_drama "Non-Aristotelian drama") " of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other [arts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts "The arts"), including the strategy of divergent chapters in [James Joyce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce") 's novel *[Ulysses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_\(novel\) "Ulysses (novel)")*, [Sergei Eisenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein "Sergei Eisenstein") 's evolution of a [constructivist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_\(art\) "Constructivism (art)") " [montage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory "Soviet montage theory") " in the cinema, and [Picasso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso "Pablo Picasso") 's introduction of [cubist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism "Cubism") "collage" in the visual arts.[^88]

One of Brecht's most important principles was what he called the *[Verfremdungseffekt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verfremdungseffekt "Verfremdungseffekt")* (translated as "defamiliarization effect", "distancing effect", or "estrangement effect", and often mistranslated as "alienation effect").[^89] This involved, Brecht wrote, "stripping the event of its self-evident, familiar, obvious quality and creating a sense of astonishment and curiosity about them".[^90] To this end, Brecht employed techniques such as the actor's direct address to the audience, harsh and bright stage lighting, the use of songs to [interrupt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interruptions_\(epic_theatre\) "Interruptions (epic theatre)") the action, explanatory placards, the transposition of text to the [third person](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person") or [past tense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_tense "Past tense") in rehearsals, and speaking the stage directions out loud.[^91]

In contrast to many other [avant-garde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde "Avant-garde") approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to [destroy art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-art "Anti-art") as an institution; rather, he hoped to " [re-function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refunctioning "Refunctioning") " the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the [aesthetic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics") debates of his era—particularly over the " [high art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture "High culture") /popular culture" dichotomy—vying with the likes of [Theodor W. Adorno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno "Theodor W. Adorno"), [György Lukács](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs "György Lukács"), [Ernst Bloch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Bloch "Ernst Bloch"), and developing a close friendship with [Walter Benjamin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin "Walter Benjamin"). Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its [psychological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_\(theatre\) "Realism (theatre)") and [socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism "Socialist realism") varieties. "Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since [Ibsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen "Henrik Ibsen") and [Strindberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Strindberg "August Strindberg")," [Raymond Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams "Raymond Williams") argues,[^92] while [Peter Bürger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_B%C3%BCrger_\(Literaturwissenschaftler\) "de:Peter Bürger (Literaturwissenschaftler)") dubs him "the most important [materialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") writer of our time." <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEB%C3%BCrger198488-94"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup>

Brecht was also influenced by Chinese theatre, and used its aesthetic as an argument for *Verfremdungseffekt*. Brecht believed, "Traditional Chinese acting also knows the alienation \[sic\] effect, and applies it most subtly.[^94] The \[Chinese\] performer portrays incidents of utmost passion, but without his delivery becoming heated." [^95] Brecht attended a Chinese opera performance and was introduced to the famous Chinese opera performer [Mei Lanfang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_Lanfang "Mei Lanfang") in 1935.[^96] However, Brecht was sure to distinguish between Epic and Chinese theatre. He recognized that the Chinese style was not a "transportable piece of technique",[^97] and that epic theatre sought to historicize and address social and political issues.[^98]

Brecht used his poetry to criticize European culture, including [Nazis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazis "Nazis"), and the German [bourgeoisie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie"). Brecht's poetry is marked by the effects of the [First](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War") and [Second World Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War").

Throughout his theatric production, poems are incorporated into his plays with music. In 1951, Brecht issued a recantation of his apparent suppression of poetry in his plays with a note titled *On Poetry and Virtuosity*. He writes:

> We shall not need to speak of a play's poetry... something that seemed relatively unimportant in the immediate past. It seemed not only unimportant, but misleading, and the reason was not that the poetic element had been sufficiently developed and observed, but that reality had been tampered with in its name... we had to speak of a truth as distinct from poetry... we have given up examining works of art from their poetic or artistic aspect, and got satisfaction from theatrical works that have no sort of poetic appeal... Such works and performances may have some effect, but it can hardly be a profound one, not even politically. For it is a peculiarity of the theatrical medium that it communicates awarenesses and impulses in the form of pleasure: the depth of the pleasure and the impulse will correspond to the depth of the pleasure.

Brecht's most influential poetry is featured in his *Manual of Piety (Devotions)*, establishing him as a noted poet.

Brecht's widow, the actress [Helene Weigel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Weigel "Helene Weigel"), continued to manage the Berliner Ensemble until her death in 1971. The theatre company was primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays. His plays were a focus of the [Schauspiel Frankfurt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schauspiel_Frankfurt "Schauspiel Frankfurt") when [Harry Buckwitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Buckwitz "Harry Buckwitz") was general manager, including the world premiere of *[Die Gesichte der Simone Machard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Visions_of_Simone_Machard "The Visions of Simone Machard")* in 1957.[^99]

Brecht's son, [Stefan Brecht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Brecht "Stefan Brecht"), became a poet and theatre critic interested in New York's [avant-garde theatre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_theatre "Experimental theatre").

Besides being a prominent dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht has also been cited by scholars for making significant original contributions to social and political philosophy.[^100]

The aesthetic theories of Brecht had a major influence on radical cinema in the 1960s and 1970s. [Jean-Luc Godard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard "Jean-Luc Godard"), [Alexandre Kluge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kluge "Alexander Kluge"), [Rainer Werner Fassbinder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Werner_Fassbinder "Rainer Werner Fassbinder"), [Nagisa Ōshima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagisa_%C5%8Cshima "Nagisa Ōshima") and [Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straub%E2%80%93Huillet "Straub–Huillet") are often cited as the principal exponents of "Brechtian cinema".[^101]

Brecht's collaborations with Kurt Weill influenced the evolution of [rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music"). The " [Alabama Song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Song "Alabama Song") " for example, originally published as a poem in Brecht's *Hauspostille* (1927) and set to music by Weill in *Mahagonny*, was recorded by [The Doors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors "The Doors") on their self-titled debut album, as well as by [David Bowie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie") and various other bands and soloists since the 1960s.[^102] In his memoir, [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan") wrote about the huge impact that " [Pirate Jenny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Jenny "Pirate Jenny") " from *The Threepenny Opera* had on him. He first heard the song in a New York theatrical show that featured compositions by Brecht and Weill. At the time, Dylan was performing traditional folk music and had barely ventured into his own songwriting. But the "outrageous power" of "Pirate Jenny" was an epiphany which prompted him to start experimenting with the storytelling possibilities of song.[^103]

Collective and collaborative working methods were inherent to Brecht's approach, as [Fredric Jameson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson "Fredric Jameson") (among others) stresses. Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that "certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or [individualistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism "Individualism") sense." During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, [scenographers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenographer "Scenographer"), directors, [dramaturgs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturg "Dramaturg") and actors; the list includes: [Elisabeth Hauptmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Hauptmann "Elisabeth Hauptmann"), [Helene Weigel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Weigel "Helene Weigel"), [Margarete Steffin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarete_Steffin "Margarete Steffin"), [Ruth Berlau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Berlau "Ruth Berlau"), [Slatan Dudow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slatan_Dudow "Slatan Dudow"), [Kurt Weill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill "Kurt Weill"), [Hanns Eisler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler "Hanns Eisler"), [Paul Dessau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dessau "Paul Dessau"), [Caspar Neher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Neher "Caspar Neher"), [Teo Otto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Otto "Teo Otto"), [Karl von Appen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Appen "Karl von Appen"), [Ernst Busch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Busch_\(actor\) "Ernst Busch (actor)"), [Lotte Lenya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Lenya "Lotte Lenya"), [Peter Lorre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lorre "Peter Lorre"), [Therese Giehse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therese_Giehse "Therese Giehse"), [Angelika Hurwicz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelika_Hurwicz "Angelika Hurwicz"), [Carola Neher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carola_Neher "Carola Neher") and [Charles Laughton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Laughton "Charles Laughton"). This is "theatre as collective experiment \[...\] as something radically different from theatre as expression or as experience." [^104]

Brecht wrote hundreds of poems throughout his life.[^108] He began writing poetry as a young boy, and his first poems were published in 1914. His poetry was influenced by folk-ballads, French *chansons*, and the poetry of [Rimbaud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud "Arthur Rimbaud") and [Villon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Villon "François Villon"). The last collection of new poetry by Brecht published in his lifetime was the 1939 *[Svendborger Gedichte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svendborger_Gedichte "Svendborger Gedichte")*.[^109]

In his *[Messingkauf Dialogues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messingkauf_Dialogues "Messingkauf Dialogues")*, Brecht cites Wedekind, along with [Büchner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_B%C3%BCchner "Georg Büchner") and [Valentin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Valentin "Karl Valentin"), as his "chief influences" in his early years: "he", Brecht writes of himself in the third person, "also saw the writer *Wedekind* performing his own works in a style which he had developed in cabaret. Wedekind had worked as a [ballad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad "Ballad") singer; he accompanied himself on the lute."

[^32]: According to Willett, Brecht was disgruntled with the [Deutsches Theater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Theater_\(Berlin\) "Deutsches Theater (Berlin)") at not being given a Shakespeare production to direct. At the end of the 1924–1925 season, both his and [Carl Zuckmayer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zuckmayer "Carl Zuckmayer") 's (his fellow dramaturg) contracts were not renewed. ([Willett 1967](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillett1967), p. 145). Zuckmayer relates how: "Brecht seldom turned up there; with his flapping leather jacket he looked like a cross between a lorry driver and a Jesuit seminarist. Roughly speaking, what he wanted was to take over complete control; the season's programme must be regulated entirely according to his theories, and the stage be rechristened 'epic smoke theatre', it being his view that people might actually be disposed to think if they were allowed to smoke at the same time. As this was refused him he confined himself to coming and drawing his pay." (Quoted by [Willett 1967](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillett1967), p. 145.

In his book *The Political Theatre*, Piscator wrote: "Perhaps my whole style of directing is a direct result of the total lack of suitable plays. It would certainly not have taken so dominant form if adequate plays had been on hand when I started" (1929, 185).

[^51]: [Willett 1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillett1998), p. 104. In relation to his innovations in the use of theatre technology, Piscator wrote: "technical innovations were never an end in themselves for me. Any means I have used or am currently in the process of using were designed to elevate the events on the stage onto a [historical plane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicization "Historicization") and not just to enlarge the technical range of the stage machinery. My technical devices had been developed to cover up the deficiencies of the dramatists' products" ("Basic Principles of a Sociological Drama" \[1929\]; in [Kolocotroni, Goldman & Taxidou 1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFKolocotroniGoldmanTaxidou1998), p. 243).

The similarities between Brecht's and Piscator's theoretical formulations from the time indicate that the two agreed on fundamentals; compare Piscator's summation of the achievements of his first company (1929), which follows, with Brecht's [*Mahagonny* Notes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Theatre_Is_the_Epic_Theatre "The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre") (1930): "In lieu of private themes we had generalisation, in lieu of what was special the typical, in lieu of accident causality. Decorativeness gave way to constructedness, Reason was put on a par with Emotion, while sensuality was replaced by didacticism and fantasy by documentary reality." From a speech given by Piscator on 25 March 1929, and reproduced in *Schriften 2* p. 50; quoted by [Willett 1978](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillett1978), p. 107.

[^55]: The two first met in March 1927, after Weill had written a critical introduction to the broadcast on Berlin Radio of an adaptation of Brecht's *[Man Equals Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Equals_Man "Man Equals Man")*. When they met, Brecht was 29 years old and Weill was 27. Brecht had experience of writing songs and had performed his own with tunes he had composed; at the time he was also married to an opera singer (Zoff). Weill had collaborated with [Georg Kaiser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Kaiser "Georg Kaiser"), one of the few [Expressionist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism "Expressionism") playwrights that Brecht admired; he was married to the actress [Lotte Lenya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Lenya "Lotte Lenya") ([Willett & Manheim 1970](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillettManheim1970), p. xv).

[^56]: Willet and Manheim (1979, xv–xviii). In Munich in 1924 Brecht had begun referring to some of the stranger aspects of life in post- [putsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch "Beer Hall Putsch") Bavaria under the codename "Mahagonny". The *Amerikanismus* imagery appears in his first three "Mahagonny Songs", with their Wild West references. With that, however, the project stalled for two and a half years. With Hauptmann, who wrote the two English-language "Mahagonny Songs", Brecht had begun work on an opera to be called *Sodom and Gomorrah* or *The Man from Manhattan* and a radio play called *The Flood* or 'The Collapse of Miami, the Paradise City', both of which came to underlie the new scheme with Weill. See [Willett & Manheim 1970](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillettManheim1970), pp. xv–xvi. The influence of *Amerikanismus* is most clearly discernible in Brecht's *[In the Jungle of Cities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Jungle_of_Cities "In the Jungle of Cities")*.

[^57]: In this respect, the creative process for *[Mahagonny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahagonny "Mahagonny")* was quite different from *[The Threepenny Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera "The Threepenny Opera")*, with the former being *durchkomponiert* or set to music right through, whereas on the latter Weill was brought at a late stage to set the songs.

They were all "broken", and by this I mean they avoided the problem of Stalinism, ran from it. Never mentioned their murdered friends and comrades, mostly in the USSR. Never engaged politically during Slansky Trial in Prague. "Broken" means they experienced the lie. I accuse them of keeping silent about the crimes of Stalin's regime. They put aside the whole complex of guilt that came with communism, real communism, or Stalinism to be precise. If that was not enough, they also wrote panegyrics praising Stalin, and they did that when they already knew about all these murders and atrocities.

Willett observes: "With Brecht the same [montage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory "Soviet montage theory") technique spread to the drama, where the old [Procrustean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes "Procrustes") plot yielded to a more " [epic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_drama "Non-Aristotelian drama") " form of narrative better able to cope with wide-ranging modern socio-economic themes. That, at least, was how Brecht theoretically justified his choice of form, and from about 1929 on he began to interpret its penchant for " [contradictions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction "Contradiction") ", much as had [Sergei Eisenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein "Sergei Eisenstein"), in terms of the [dialectic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic "Dialectic"). It is fairly clear that in Brecht's case the practice came before the theory, for his actual composition of a play, with its switching around of scenes and characters, even the physical cutting up and sticking together of the typescript, shows that montage was the structural technique most natural to him. Like [Jaroslav Hašek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Ha%C5%A1ek "Jaroslav Hašek") and Joyce he had not learnt this scissors-and-paste method from the Soviet cinema but picked it out of the air" ([Willett 1978](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFWillett1978), p. 110).

[^89]: [Brooker 1994](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/#CITEREFBrooker1994), p. 193. Brooker writes that "the term 'alienation' is an inadequate and even misleading translation of Brecht's *Verfremdung*. The terms 'de-familiarisation' or 'estrangement', when understood as more than purely formal devices, give a more accurate sense of Brecht's intentions. A better term still would be 'de- [alienation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation "Marx's theory of alienation") '".
