## Hypothesis

- Backyard has many unused features
Not true, the work is just fragmented by the user t ype
- Backyard is used by all roles
Not all roles can use the Backyard, instead they have to use replacement tools and other workflows
- Backyard is not scalable
Most things were made to support **sales** work
Other roles are not supported enough
- Backyard performace
Users don't care *that* much

- [[Coach]]'s communicate by â˜Ž
Not so much the case, they would like to have other options

- Automation is key
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not true, most things **have to** be done by in person</mark>
- Navigation is not intuitive
==Not the case for users==
- Backyard Error rate
Doesn't have much impact
- Processes are standardized
==Nope==

### Sales

**duties**
- Kit creation 
- creates P1 leads

**notes** ðŸ“”
- sales are atm focused too much on the hottest leads
	- they receive commisions
	- they don't do enough work on  **long term** leads

### Back Office

#### active periods

- P1 to P2
	- Calls to get feedbacks on visits


# SLMP

 - a much simpler workflow
 - most leads are processed much faster
 - most of the payments are done upfront
	 - doesn't require us to wait for a sale
	 - no need to follow trough on every lead
	 - only the most valuable leads are tracked and paid by comission
- Refunds are done by points
	- no money is given back
- Some roles are not needed any more
	- Back Office

## leads logic

- leads are graded
- after a period of time the lead get's downgraded

**grades**
- Diamond
- Gold
- Silver
- Bronze

**question**
1. what happens if one lead is removed but tries to get back in ?

## Agents logic

- agents are also graded by their **interactions**


questions

1. do we follow up on **diamond** leads only
