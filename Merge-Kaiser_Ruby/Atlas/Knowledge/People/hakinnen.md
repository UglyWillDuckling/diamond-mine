Häkkinen won several races during his [2000](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Formula_One_World_Championship "2000 Formula One World Championship") campaign, where he was unable to beat Schumacher to a third title. Häkkinen retired at the conclusion of the [2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Formula_One_World_Championship "2001 Formula One World Championship") season—taking his final victory at the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_United_States_Grand_Prix "2001 United States Grand Prix") —having achieved 20 race wins, 26 pole positions, 25 fastest laps and 51 podiums in Formula One.

Häkkinen was born in [Helsingin maalaiskunta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantaa "Vantaa"), [Finland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), on 28 September 1968 to Harri, a [shortwave radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio "Shortwave radio") operator and a part-time taxi driver, and Aila Häkkinen, who worked as a secretary. He has one sister, Nina, who ran a fan site for him until its closure in 1998.[^2] Häkkinen lived in the same street as [Mika Salo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Salo "Mika Salo") with the two later becoming friends.[^3] As a child, Häkkinen played [ice hockey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey "Ice hockey") and [football](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football").[^4]

When Häkkinen was five years old, his parents rented a [go-kart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-kart "Go-kart") for him to take to a track near their home. Despite an early crash, Häkkinen wished to continue racing, and his father bought him his first go-kart, one that [Henri Toivonen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Toivonen "Henri Toivonen") had previously competed with.[^5] He later won his first karting race in 1975 at the [Keimola Motor Stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keimola_Motor_Stadium "Keimola Motor Stadium") where he raced in the regional karting championships in 1978 and 1979, winning the Keimola Club Championship in both years. Häkkinen found further success in 1980 when he won the Swedish Lapland Cup and finished fourth in the 85cc class of the Lapland Karting Championship. Around this time, Häkkinen also drove a [Volkswagen Beetle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle "Volkswagen Beetle") on the frozen lakes of Finland with friend Mika Sohlberg.[^6]

In 1981, Häkkinen won his first major karting title, the 85cc class of the Finnish Karting Championship. The following year, he finished runner-up in the 85cc class of the Formula Mini series and later won the Ronnie Peterson Memorial event and the Salpauselka Cup in Lahti. Häkkinen moved to the Formula Nordic 100cc class for 1983, where he became the champion on his first attempt and also participated in the A Junior Team Races for Finland alongside [Taru Rinne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taru_Rinne "Taru Rinne"), Jaana Nyman and Marko Mankonen, with the line-up taking the championship.[^7]

In 1984, Häkkinen won the 100cc Formula Nordic title and later participated in the [World Kart Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karting_World_Championship "Karting World Championship") race held in [Liedolsheim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liedolsheim "Liedolsheim"). He took his second consecutive 100cc Formula Nordic Championship in 1985 ahead of Jukka Savolainen. He took part in the Nordic Championship A-Class in the same year, finishing runner-up to [Tom Kristensen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kristensen_\(racing_driver\) "Tom Kristensen (racing driver)"). Häkkinen went to [Parma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma "Parma") to participate in the World Kart Championship where he retired before the event's final heat due to a mechanical problem. In 1986, he reached his third consecutive Formula Nordic 100cc title and also took part in karting events across Europe.[^7] To further fund his career, Häkkinen got a job with a friend repairing bicycles.[^8]

In 1987, Häkkinen made the transition from karting to car racing when he purchased a 1986 Reynard Formula Ford 1600 from fellow Finn [JJ Lehto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Lehto "JJ Lehto"). In that year, he entered the Finnish, Swedish and Nordic Formula Ford Championships, winning each title on his first attempt and won nine races combined. Häkkinen also entered two races of the EDFA 1600 Championship and raced in the Formula Ford Festival held at [Brands Hatch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brands_Hatch "Brands Hatch"), where he finished in seventh position.[^9] In 1988, Häkkinen entered the GM Vauxhall-Lotus Challenge with the [Dragon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dragon_Motorsport&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dragon Motorsport (page does not exist)") team, where he secured three victories and finished the runner-up in the championship, behind [Allan McNish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_McNish "Allan McNish"). He later entered the Opel-Lotus EDFA Euroseries in the same year, taking four victories and became Champion with 126 points, ahead of nearest rival [Henrik Larsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henrik_Larsen_\(racing_driver\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Henrik Larsen (racing driver) (page does not exist)").[^9]

Going into 1989, Häkkinen moved from the Euroseries into the [British Formula 3 Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Formula_3_Championship "British Formula 3 Championship") driving a Reynard 893 chassis for Dragon. He finished seventh position in the championship, scoring 18 points. He was later invited to participate in the Cellnet Formula Three SuperPrix for [West Surrey Racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Surrey_Racing "West Surrey Racing") as a guest driver where he secured pole position and the victory.[^10] He also raced in the tenth round of the French Formula 3 championship at Le Mans-Bugatti on 24 September and finished third behind Éric Hélary and Laurent Daumet.

In 1990, Häkkinen applied to become a member of the " *[Marlboro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlboro_\(cigarette\) "Marlboro (cigarette)") World Championship Team* " through what was akin to a fully sponsored racing driver academy. Its members were short-listed for testing by a judging panel including Marlboro [McLaren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") team principal [Ron Dennis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dennis "Ron Dennis"), [1976](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Formula_One_season "1976 Formula One season") Formula One World Drivers' Champion [James Hunt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hunt "James Hunt"), and Formula 3000 team bosses, Mike Earle and Hugues de Chaunac. Häkkinen was also a [protégé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9 "Protégé") of [1982](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Formula_One_World_Championship "1982 Formula One World Championship") World Drivers' Champion [Keke Rosberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Rosberg "Keke Rosberg").[^11] In an April 2015 interview, Earle recounted that Häkkinen's application was the last one that he reviewed at the end of a long day, despite protests by Hunt who had already made plans to head to a pub for a beer.[^12] Häkkinen performed strongly in his test and went on to secure Marlboro's sponsorship. That same year, therefore, Häkkinen left Dragon and moved to the West Surrey Racing team and won the British Formula 3 series, by taking nine victories en route to the Championship, with 121 points, ahead of fellow Finn Salo. In November, Häkkinen entered the [Macau Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Macau_Grand_Prix "1990 Macau Grand Prix") where he drove to pole position and won the first heat of the event. He retired from the second heat due to a last-lap collision with [German Formula Three](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Formula_Three "German Formula Three") driver and future Formula One rival [Michael Schumacher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher "Michael Schumacher"), who was classified as the overall winner.[^9]

Häkkinen driving for Lotus at the [1991 United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_United_States_Grand_Prix "1991 United States Grand Prix"), his Formula One debut race

Häkkinen made his first test in a Formula One car with the [Benetton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benetton_Formula "Benetton Formula") team driving 90 laps around the [Silverstone Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit "Silverstone Circuit") and set quicker lap times than regular driver [Alessandro Nannini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Nannini "Alessandro Nannini"). He found it difficult to fit into the Benetton but liked the steering and throttle response. Häkkinen expected not to be offered a seat at Benetton and he decided to sign with the [Lotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Lotus "Team Lotus") team for the [1991 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Formula_One_season "1991 Formula One season").[^9] Making his debut in the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_United_States_Grand_Prix "1991 United States Grand Prix") alongside teammate [Julian Bailey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bailey_\(racing_driver\) "Julian Bailey (racing driver)"), Häkkinen qualified thirteenth on the grid and suffered an engine failure on the sixtieth lap and was classified thirteenth. The next race in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "1991 Brazilian Grand Prix") saw him finish ninth, and scored his first Formula One points by reaching fifth place in [San Marino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1991 San Marino Grand Prix").[^13] Häkkinen suffered from a dip in race form as he encountered consecutive retirements in the next two races—his car suffered from an oil leak in [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Monaco_Grand_Prix "1991 Monaco Grand Prix") and spun out in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Canadian_Grand_Prix "1991 Canadian Grand Prix").[^14] [^15] Before Canada, Bailey lost his seat at Lotus due to a lack of funding,[^16] so Häkkinen was partnered by [Johnny Herbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Herbert "Johnny Herbert") and [Michael Bartels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bartels "Michael Bartels") throughout the remainder of the season.[^17]

Although Häkkinen secured a ninth-place finish in [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Mexican_Grand_Prix "1991 Mexican Grand Prix"), he did not qualify for the [French Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_French_Grand_Prix "1991 French Grand Prix"). Over the remainder of the season, he did not finish four of the nine races he entered. Häkkinen finished his debut season sixteenth in the Drivers' Championship, scoring two points.[^13]

Häkkinen at the [1992 British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_British_Grand_Prix "1992 British Grand Prix")

Häkkinen remained at Lotus for [1992](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Formula_One_season "1992 Formula One season") and was partnered by Herbert.[^18] At the opening round of the season in [South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_South_African_Grand_Prix "1992 South African Grand Prix"), Häkkinen finished in ninth position, which he followed up with his first points of the season in [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Mexican_Grand_Prix "1992 Mexican Grand Prix"). He took a further finish in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "1992 Brazilian Grand Prix"), although he did not qualify for the [San Marino Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1992 San Marino Grand Prix") and suffered consecutive retirements in the following two races.[^13] At [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Monaco_Grand_Prix "1992 Monaco Grand Prix"), Lotus introduced their new car, the [Lotus 107](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_107 "Lotus 107"). Häkkinen later gathered further consecutive points in the following two races,[^13] before he was forced into retirement at the [German Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_German_Grand_Prix "1992 German Grand Prix") due to an engine failure.[^19] A similar pattern followed in the next three races, which was broken when he finished fifth in [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Portuguese_Grand_Prix "1992 Portuguese Grand Prix") and suffered a retirement at the penultimate round of the year in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1992 Japanese Grand Prix"). Häkkinen concluded the season with a seventh-place finish in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Australian_Grand_Prix "1992 Australian Grand Prix").[^13]

During the season, Häkkinen became embroiled in a contract dispute. Häkkinen, who was under contract to Lotus, opted to join [Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WilliamsF1 "WilliamsF1"). However, Williams had not submitted their entry for the 1993 season, and Häkkinen was unable to join the team when he learnt that Lotus team principal Peter Collins would veto the Williams team entry if they had signed Häkkinen.[^20] Häkkinen later approached [Ligier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipe_Ligier "Equipe Ligier") although his contract contained a clause of which his manager [Keke Rosberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Rosberg "Keke Rosberg") disagreed. He later approached [McLaren](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren "McLaren") team principal [Ron Dennis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dennis "Ron Dennis") for a contract with the team, which was drafted at [Courchevel Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courchevel_Airport "Courchevel Airport"). The dispute eventually went to the Formula One Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of McLaren after two days of deliberation.[^20]

Häkkinen in the paddock before the [1993 British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_British_Grand_Prix "1993 British Grand Prix")

For [1993](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Formula_One_season "1993 Formula One season"), Häkkinen joined McLaren, originally as a race driver, although he became the team's official test driver when [CART](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Championship_Auto_Racing_Teams "Championship Auto Racing Teams") driver [Michael Andretti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Andretti "Michael Andretti") was hired by the team.[^20] Apart from regular testing duties, Häkkinen entered two [Porsche Supercup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Supercup "Porsche Supercup") races, held as a support race for the [Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Monaco_Grand_Prix "1993 Monaco Grand Prix"), where he started at pole position and took victory in both races. He was promoted to a Formula One race seat after the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Italian_Grand_Prix "1993 Italian Grand Prix"), when Andretti left Formula One. Häkkinen entered the [Portuguese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Portuguese_Grand_Prix "1993 Portuguese Grand Prix") where he out-qualified regular driver [Ayrton Senna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna "Ayrton Senna"). During the race, he retired due to collision with a concrete wall.[^21] At the next race held in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1993 Japanese Grand Prix"), Häkkinen claimed the first podium of his career with a third-place finish,[^22] and ended the season when his McLaren car suffered a brake pipe failure in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Australian_Grand_Prix "1993 Australian Grand Prix").[^23] Häkkinen concluded the season with 15th in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 4 points.[^13] In December, McLaren confirmed that Häkkinen would remain with the team on a three-year contract from the 1994 season onwards.[^24]

During 1993, Häkkinen, along with Senna, tested the [Lamborghini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_V12 "Lamborghini V12") [V12 engine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V12_engine "V12 engine") in a modified version of the [McLaren MP4/8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/8 "McLaren MP4/8") race car dubbed the "MP4/8B" at both [Estoril](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoril "Estoril") and [Silverstone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit "Silverstone Circuit"). Both drivers were impressed with the engine, with Häkkinen reportedly lapping Silverstone some 1.4 seconds faster in the MP4/8B with its V12 engine than he had with the team's race car fitted with the [Ford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "Ford Motor Company") V8.[^25]

Häkkinen driving for McLaren at the [1994 British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_British_Grand_Prix "1994 British Grand Prix")

Häkkinen stayed at McLaren for [1994](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_season "1994 Formula One season") and was partnered by experienced driver [Martin Brundle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Brundle "Martin Brundle"). He endured a torrid start: at the first two races of the season, Häkkinen retired as his car developed engine problems in the [Brazilian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "1994 Brazilian Grand Prix") and gearbox issues in the [Pacific Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Pacific_Grand_Prix "1994 Pacific Grand Prix") which included a collision with Senna on the first lap.[^26] [^27] He later reached his first podium finish of the season at the [San Marino Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1994 San Marino Grand Prix"), although he suffered a dip in form as he was forced into consecutive retirements in the next four races.[^13]

Häkkinen raced to a further podium finish at the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_British_Grand_Prix "1994 British Grand Prix"), despite a last-lap collision with Jordan driver [Rubens Barrichello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens_Barrichello "Rubens Barrichello") for which he received a one-race ban, suspended for three races.[^9] The ban was enforced after the [German Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_German_Grand_Prix "1994 German Grand Prix"), where Häkkinen collided with Williams driver [David Coulthard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Coulthard "David Coulthard") with the Finn's car sliding into another group of cars. He was replaced by [Philippe Alliot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Alliot "Philippe Alliot") for the next race in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "1994 Hungarian Grand Prix").[^28]

Häkkinen returned for the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Belgian_Grand_Prix "1994 Belgian Grand Prix"), initially coming third but was later promoted to second after the disqualification of Benetton driver Michael Schumacher.[^29] He got consecutive 3rd-place podium finishes in the next three races, before rounding off the season by finishing the final two races in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1994 Japanese Grand Prix") and [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Australian_Grand_Prix "1994 Australian Grand Prix"), albeit outside of the points scoring positions. Häkkinen managed a fourth place in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 26 points.[^13]

Häkkinen driving for McLaren at the [1995 British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_British_Grand_Prix "1995 British Grand Prix")

Häkkinen remained at McLaren for [1995](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Formula_One_season "1995 Formula One season"), and was partnered by [Nigel Mansell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell "Nigel Mansell"). During pre-season testing, Häkkinen and teammate Mansell complained the car, the [McLaren MP4/10](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/10 "McLaren MP4/10"), was not wide enough to fit in, resulting in their hands and elbows striking the sides of the cockpit.[^30] Mansell was forced to miss the opening two rounds, so Häkkinen was partnered with [Mark Blundell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Blundell "Mark Blundell").[^31]

Häkkinen started off the season by finishing fourth in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "1995 Brazilian Grand Prix"),[^32] and later retired in [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Argentine_Grand_Prix "1995 Argentine Grand Prix") due to a collision which punctured his left rear tyre that followed a spin. He took a further points finish with a 5th place at [San Marino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1995 San Marino Grand Prix"), before suffering from consecutive retirements in the next three races.[^13] For the [French Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_French_Grand_Prix "1995 French Grand Prix"), McLaren introduced a revised version of their car, the [McLaren MP4/10B](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/10B "McLaren MP4/10B"). This did not revive Häkkinen's fortunes as he did not finish in the points scoring positions, and later suffered consecutive retirements in the next four races,[^13] but got second place at the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Italian_Grand_Prix "1995 Italian Grand Prix").[^33] He was forced to miss the [Pacific Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Pacific_Grand_Prix "1995 Pacific Grand Prix") due to an operation for [appendicitis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis "Appendicitis") and was replaced by [Jan Magnussen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Magnussen "Jan Magnussen").[^34] He returned for the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1995 Japanese Grand Prix"), with a second-place finish.[^35]

At the season finale held in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Australian_Grand_Prix "1995 Australian Grand Prix"), Häkkinen's car suffered a tyre failure during the event's first qualifying session on Friday, which resulted in his car becoming airborne and crashing sideways into the crash barrier on the outside of Brewery corner, the fastest corner of the [Adelaide Street Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Street_Circuit "Adelaide Street Circuit"), at an estimated speed of 120 mph.[^36] The session was suspended with Häkkinen being critically injured due to sustaining a [skull fracture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture "Skull fracture"), internal bleeding and a blockage of his airway. His life was saved by the efforts of the trackside medical team, including the President of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, [Sid Watkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Watkins "Sid Watkins"), and volunteer doctors Jerome Cockings and Steve Lewis,[^37] from the [Royal Adelaide Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Adelaide_Hospital "Royal Adelaide Hospital"). Cockings performed an emergency [tracheotomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy "Tracheotomy") on the track, delivering oxygen to enable Häkkinen to breathe.[^38] Watkins later arrived in the medical car, allowing the doctors to continue, restarting Häkkinen's heart twice.[^39] [^40] Häkkinen was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Royal Adelaide Hospital which was located about half a kilometre from the circuit. There he remained in a critical condition under care of the Trauma Service, the Neurosurgical Unit, and the Intensive Care Unit and remained in the hospital for approximately two months. He eventually made a remarkable recovery.[^41] As an expression of thanks for the elite class medical attention he received, Häkkinen donated a substantial undisclosed sum of money to help build a much-needed helipad for The Royal Adelaide Hospital, and made a special trip to Australia for the official opening ceremony in March 1997.[^42]

Häkkinen finished the 1995 season seventh in the Drivers' Championship, with 17 points.[^13]

Häkkinen and [Johnny Herbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Herbert "Johnny Herbert") during free practice of [1996 San Marino Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1996 San Marino Grand Prix")

The [1996 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Formula_One_season "1996 Formula One season") was the first in which Häkkinen was the more experienced driver in his team and was partnered by David Coulthard. Häkkinen was confident going into the season and set himself a target of winning races.[^43] To ensure his fitness, Häkkinen spent time training in [Bali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali "Bali") and in February, McLaren conducted a secret test at the [Paul Ricard Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ricard_Circuit "Paul Ricard Circuit"). In the event that Häkkinen was not prepared, McLaren had Magnussen to replace him should the need arise.[^44] The season started well for Häkkinen: He earned consecutive points-scoring positions in the opening two rounds, before he suffered his first retirement of the season in [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Argentine_Grand_Prix "1996 Argentine Grand Prix") as his car developed a throttle problem.[^45] He later finished the next two races, albeit outside of the points scoring positions, before returning consecutive finishes inside of the points in the following four races.[^13]

In the following race held in [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_British_Grand_Prix "1996 British Grand Prix") where McLaren brought a revised version of the car, their [McLaren MP4/11B](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/11B "McLaren MP4/11B"), Häkkinen reached his first podium finish of the season with third place.[^46] However, he retired from the next race held in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_German_Grand_Prix "1996 German Grand Prix") due to a gearbox failure.[^47] This marked a turning point in Häkkinen's season as he finished the next three races, including consecutive third-place finishes in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Belgian_Grand_Prix "1996 Belgian Grand Prix") and [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Italian_Grand_Prix "1996 Italian Grand Prix").[^13] In September, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 1997,[^48] having previously been linked to Williams and [Benetton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benetton_Formula "Benetton Formula").[^49] He retired from the penultimate round in [Portugal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Portuguese_Grand_Prix "1996 Portuguese Grand Prix") resulting a collision with teammate Coulthard, damaging Häkkinen's front wing and eventually led to his retirement on the 52nd lap of the race.[^50] He rounded off the season with a third-place finish in season finale held in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1996 Japanese Grand Prix"). Häkkinen finished the season fifth in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 31 points.[^13]

The [McLaren MP4/12](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/12 "McLaren MP4/12"), driven by Häkkinen in 1997

Häkkinen again remained at McLaren for [1997](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Formula_One_season "1997 Formula One season") and Coulthard remained his teammate. Häkkinen's season got off to a good start: In the season-opening race in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Australian_Grand_Prix "1997 Australian Grand Prix"), he drove up to the third position and later scored further consecutive finishes inside of the points scoring positions in the next three races.[^13] He suffered his first retirement of the season at the [Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Monaco_Grand_Prix "1997 Monaco Grand Prix") when he was involved in a collision with Benetton driver [Jean Alesi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Alesi "Jean Alesi").[^51] Häkkinen later took ninth position at the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Spanish_Grand_Prix "1997 Spanish Grand Prix"),[^13] but later suffered three consecutive retirements in the next three races—a collision with Ferrari driver [Eddie Irvine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Irvine "Eddie Irvine") in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Canadian_Grand_Prix "1997 Canadian Grand Prix") and engine failures in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_French_Grand_Prix "1997 French Grand Prix") and [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_British_Grand_Prix "1997 British Grand Prix"). At the latter race, he had seemed set for his first win, but his engine blew while he was holding off eventual winner [Jacques Villeneuve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve "Jacques Villeneuve").[^52]

Häkkinen secured another podium finish with third place in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_German_Grand_Prix "1997 German Grand Prix") and later retired from an hydraulic problem in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "1997 Hungarian Grand Prix"). He later secured third place in the [Belgian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Belgian_Grand_Prix "1997 Belgian Grand Prix") but was later disqualified when it was discovered that his car used an illegal type of fuel during the event.[^53] He secured a ninth-place finish in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Italian_Grand_Prix "1997 Italian Grand Prix") and later suffered from consecutive retirements in the next two races—engine failures in the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Austrian_Grand_Prix "1997 Austrian Grand Prix") and the [Luxembourg Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Luxembourg_Grand_Prix "1997 Luxembourg Grand Prix") while leading both races.[^54] Häkkinen ended the season with a fourth position in the penultimate round in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1997 Japanese Grand Prix") and raced to his first Formula One victory at the season closing [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_European_Grand_Prix "1997 European Grand Prix").[^13] Häkkinen ended the season sixth in the Drivers' Championship, with 27 points.[^13]

Häkkinen driving for McLaren at the [1998 Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Spanish_Grand_Prix "1998 Spanish Grand Prix"), where he claimed his third win in the first five races of the season

Häkkinen remained at McLaren for [1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Formula_One_season "1998 Formula One season"), partnered by Coulthard. Häkkinen was confident going about the challenge for the World Championship into the season, citing the involvement of technical director [Adrian Newey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey "Adrian Newey").[^55] The season started off with controversy in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Australian_Grand_Prix "1998 Australian Grand Prix") when teammate Coulthard let Häkkinen past to win the race. Häkkinen had earlier been called into the pit lane by an engineer by mistake. Coulthard later revealed a pre-race agreement by the team that whoever led into the first corner on the first lap would be allowed to win the race.[^56] Despite this, Häkkinen took back-to-back victories by winning the next race in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "1998 Brazilian Grand Prix").[^57] He maintained his good form at the [Argentine Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Argentine_Grand_Prix "1998 Argentine Grand Prix") where he finished second, although he retired from the [San Marino Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1998 San Marino Grand Prix") when his car's gearbox failed. However, Häkkinen managed consecutive victories in the next two rounds, which was followed by a retirement from the race in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Canadian_Grand_Prix "1998 Canadian Grand Prix") as his car suffered another gearbox failure.[^58]

Häkkinen followed this up by taking consecutive podiums in the next two rounds—third in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_French_Grand_Prix "1998 French Grand Prix") and second in [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_British_Grand_Prix "1998 British Grand Prix"). He managed further consecutive victories in the next two rounds, and followed this up with a sixth-place finish in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "1998 Hungarian Grand Prix").[^13] In August, it was announced that Häkkinen and Coulthard would be retained for 1999.[^59] Häkkinen retired from the following race held in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Belgian_Grand_Prix "1998 Belgian Grand Prix") when Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher collided with the Finn and was also hit by [Sauber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauber "Sauber") driver [Johnny Herbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Herbert "Johnny Herbert").[^60] He later managed a fourth position in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Italian_Grand_Prix "1998 Italian Grand Prix") despite suffering from brake problems resulting from a spin.[^61] Häkkinen finished the season by taking victory in the final two rounds at the [Luxembourg Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Luxembourg_Grand_Prix "1998 Luxembourg Grand Prix") and the [Japanese Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1998 Japanese Grand Prix"), which ensured he took enough points to clinch the 1998 World Championship, with 100 points, ahead of nearest rival Schumacher.[^62] Häkkinen was awarded the [Autosport International Racing Driver Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosport_Awards "Autosport Awards") for 1998.[^63] He was also named the [Finnish Sports Personality of the Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year "Finnish Sports Personality of the Year") by journalists.[^64] The Finnish Post Office issued stamps to commemorate Häkkinen's World Championship in January 1999.[^65]

Häkkinen driving for McLaren at the [1999 Canadian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Canadian_Grand_Prix "1999 Canadian Grand Prix"), where he drove to his third victory of the season

Häkkinen remained at McLaren for [1999](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Formula_One_season "1999 Formula One season"), with Coulthard partnering him for the upcoming season. The team suffered problems with their car, the [McLaren MP4/14](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/14 "McLaren MP4/14"), during pre-season testing, resulting in a lack of preparation. Despite these setbacks, Häkkinen was confident going into the season, saying: "I've gained confidence and experience and am more relaxed. With this title I no longer have to tell myself every morning I can win, to put pressure on myself." [^66]

At the opening round in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Australian_Grand_Prix "1999 Australian Grand Prix"), Häkkinen was forced into retiring as his car developed a throttle issue.[^66] However, he managed his first victory of the season in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "1999 Brazilian Grand Prix"), despite his car developing a gearbox problem early in the race.[^67] Häkkinen retired from the race in [San Marino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "1999 San Marino Grand Prix") when he collided with a barrier while leading.[^68] At the [Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Monaco_Grand_Prix "1999 Monaco Grand Prix"), Häkkinen finished in third place, having slid on oil left on the track surface in the race. He followed up the results by having consecutive victories in the races held in [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Spanish_Grand_Prix "1999 Spanish Grand Prix") and [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Canadian_Grand_Prix "1999 Canadian Grand Prix"). Häkkinen took a second-place finish in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_French_Grand_Prix "1999 French Grand Prix"), and was forced into another retirement in [Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_British_Grand_Prix "1999 British Grand Prix"), as a result of a wheel failure.[^66] During the [Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Austrian_Grand_Prix "1999 Austrian Grand Prix"), Häkkinen who started from [pole position](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position "Pole position"), was hit by Coulthard from behind and rejoined at the back of the field. Häkkinen eventually finished in 3rd place.[^69]

During the [German Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_German_Grand_Prix "1999 German Grand Prix"), it was announced that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 2000.[^70] Häkkinen encountered further bad fortunes in the race when his car's right rear tyre exploded at high speed, forcing his car into a 360° spin before resting on a tyre wall.[^71] He managed his fourth victory of the year at [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "1999 Hungarian Grand Prix"),[^72] and followed up the result with a second place in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Belgian_Grand_Prix "1999 Belgian Grand Prix").[^73] Häkkinen retired from the following race held in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Italian_Grand_Prix "1999 Italian Grand Prix"), due to a spin while leading the race.[^74] He finished further with fifth place at the [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_European_Grand_Prix "1999 European Grand Prix"), and achieved a podium finish with third place in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "1999 Malaysian Grand Prix").[^13] At the season finale held in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Japanese_Grand_Prix "1999 Japanese Grand Prix"), Häkkinen took victory,[^75] which ensured he took enough points to win the 1999 World Championship, with 76 points, ahead of nearest rival [Eddie Irvine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Irvine "Eddie Irvine").[^76] In November, Häkkinen was ranked seventh in the [Reuters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters "Reuters") Sports Personality of the Year Poll scoring 46 out of a possible 260 points.[^77] He was also awarded his second consecutive Autosport International Racing Driver Award for 1999.[^78] In November, Häkkinen was announced as one of the seven men shortlisted for the Finnish Sports Personality of the Year.[^79] At the awards ceremony on 28 December, Häkkinen was awarded second place behind skier [Mika Myllylä](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Myllyl%C3%A4 "Mika Myllylä").[^80]

Häkkinen driving for McLaren at the [2000 United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_Grand_Prix "2000 United States Grand Prix"), where an engine problem cost him the title lead to eventual champion [Michael Schumacher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher "Michael Schumacher")

For [2000](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Formula_One_season "2000 Formula One season"), Häkkinen set himself new limits along with physical and psychological preparations for the upcoming season. He also believed that he along with Schumacher and Coulthard would be the key drivers of 2000.[^81] He endured a bad start: at the opening round in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Australian_Grand_Prix "2000 Australian Grand Prix"), both McLaren cars retired with engine failure after completing less than half of the race distance; and in the following race in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2000 Brazilian Grand Prix"), Häkkinen was forced into retirement when his car's oil pressure became problematic.[^82] However, this marked a turning point as Häkkinen took consecutive second-place finishes in the next two rounds,[^13] and later reached his first victory of the season in [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2000 Spanish Grand Prix").[^83]

Häkkinen finished in second position at the [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_European_Grand_Prix "2000 European Grand Prix"), having traded the lead position with Schumacher throughout the race.[^84] He followed up the result by taking sixth place at [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2000 Monaco Grand Prix"), fourth in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2000 Canadian Grand Prix") and a podium finish with second position in [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_French_Grand_Prix "2000 French Grand Prix").[^85] The day after the French Grand Prix, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 2001.[^86] Häkkinen won the following race held in [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2000 Austrian Grand Prix"), although his team were stripped of constructors' points due to a missing seal on the electronic control unit in Häkkinen's car.[^87] He took another podium finish with a second place in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_German_Grand_Prix "2000 German Grand Prix"), and later had another victory at the [Hungarian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2000 Hungarian Grand Prix") where he took the lead of the World Drivers' Championship from Schumacher.[^88] Häkkinen raced to his second consecutive victory in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2000 Belgian Grand Prix"), which included a simultaneous pass on Schumacher and [Ricardo Zonta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Zonta "Ricardo Zonta") in the *Kemmel straight*.[^89] Häkkinen later took second place in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Italian_Grand_Prix "2000 Italian Grand Prix"),[^90] and retired with an engine failure in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_Grand_Prix "2000 United States Grand Prix").[^91] He rounded off the year with a second place in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2000 Japanese Grand Prix") where he conceded the World Championship to Schumacher,[^92] and held fourth position in the season closing race held in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2000 Malaysian Grand Prix").[^13]

Häkkinen driving for McLaren at the [2001 Canadian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2001 Canadian Grand Prix"), where he reached his first podium finish of 2001

For [2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Formula_One_season "2001 Formula One season"), Häkkinen pledged to make a challenge for the World Championship, citing inspiration from the birth of his son Hugo.[^93] He also added that he was under less pressure to compete, saying that results over the previous year increased his desire to win.[^94] The season started badly for Häkkinen, as he was forced into retirement in the opening round held in [Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Australian_Grand_Prix "2001 Australian Grand Prix") due to a failure with his car's suspension resulting in his car spinning violently into a tyre barrier.[^95] The McLaren cars were off the pace in [Malaysia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Malaysian_Grand_Prix "2001 Malaysian Grand Prix"), with Häkkinen managing to end at the 6th place.[^96] He retired from the following race in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Brazilian_Grand_Prix "2001 Brazilian Grand Prix") when his car stalled on the starting grid,[^97] Further points came at the [San Marino Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_San_Marino_Grand_Prix "2001 San Marino Grand Prix").[^98] At the [Spanish Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Spanish_Grand_Prix "2001 Spanish Grand Prix"), Häkkinen looked on course to win his first victory of the season, until the final lap of the race, when his car was hampered with a clutch failure and was classified ninth.[^99]

He suffered further consecutive retirements in [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2001 Austrian Grand Prix") where he stalled his car on the starting grid,[^100] and [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Monaco_Grand_Prix "2001 Monaco Grand Prix") where his car's steering failed after fifteen laps of the race.[^101] At the following race held in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Canadian_Grand_Prix "2001 Canadian Grand Prix"), Häkkinen took his first podium of the season with a third-place finish.[^102] He finished sixth at the [European Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_European_Grand_Prix "2001 European Grand Prix"), and was unable to start the [French Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_French_Grand_Prix "2001 French Grand Prix") as his car developed a gearbox problem.[^103] However, this marked a brief turning point for Häkkinen as he gained a victory in the [British Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_British_Grand_Prix "2001 British Grand Prix").[^104] He was forced into another retirement in [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_German_Grand_Prix "2001 German Grand Prix") when his engine failed,[^105] later managing fifth position in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Hungarian_Grand_Prix "2001 Hungarian Grand Prix") and fourth place in [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Belgian_Grand_Prix "2001 Belgian Grand Prix").[^13]

Before the [Italian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Italian_Grand_Prix "2001 Italian Grand Prix"), Häkkinen announced that he would be on a sabbatical for the 2002 season, citing the reason to spend more time with his family.[^106] His seat was taken by fellow countryman [Kimi Räikkönen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen "Kimi Räikkönen") in 2002.[^107] Häkkinen later stated that fear after crashes during practice for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix and the 2001 Australian Grand Prix as well as a loss of a desire to compete for race victories were factors.[^108] He was forced into another retirement during the race due to a gearbox issue. He raced to his final victory of his career in the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_United_States_Grand_Prix "2001 United States Grand Prix") despite incurring a grid penalty,[^109] and ended the season with a fourth-place finish in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Japanese_Grand_Prix "2001 Japanese Grand Prix").[^110] Häkkinen finished the season fifth in the Drivers' Championship, with 37 points.[^13]

In July 2002, nine months into his sabbatical, Häkkinen announced that he would be retiring from Formula One. It was later revealed that Häkkinen approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis during the 2001 Monaco Grand Prix and agreed a sabbatical, then returned to Monaco the following year to discuss and agree full-time retirement with Dennis.[^111] In October, Häkkinen made his first appearance as a commentator for pay-for-view channel [Canal Digital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Digital "Canal Digital") at the [United States Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_United_States_Grand_Prix "2002 United States Grand Prix").[^112]

In December 2002, it was announced that Häkkinen would be participating in the [Finnish Rally Championship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Rally_Championship "Finnish Rally Championship") driving a [Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution WRC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution_WRC "Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution WRC") 2 with his co-driver [Arto Kapanen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arto_Kapanen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Arto Kapanen (page does not exist)").[^113] He also stated that he would not move full-time into rallying and learn about driver control,[^114] although he later stated he would enter more rally events if he finished within the top two.[^115] Making his debut in the [Arctic Rally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Rally "Arctic Rally"), Häkkinen was delayed by four minutes as his team changed a tyre and eventually finished 30th.[^116] He once again entered the event in 2004 driving a [Toyota Corolla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla "Toyota Corolla") with co-driver [Risto Pietiläinen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Risto_Pietil%C3%A4inen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Risto Pietiläinen (page does not exist)") and finished seventh.[^117] [^118]

During 2004, rumors circulated that Häkkinen was making a possible return to Formula One to fill in the vacant Williams seat left by [Juan Pablo Montoya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Montoya "Juan Pablo Montoya"). In May, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis dismissed the rumors, stating that Häkkinen was not prepared for a comeback.[^119] Häkkinen held talks with BAR and Williams and later decided against returning to Formula One saying in 2005: "It's impossible to think that I would race a Formula One car again because as time passes my reactions become slower and my eyesight gets worse – that's life".[^120]

On 6 November 2004, it was announced that Häkkinen would make his debut in the [Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Masters "Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters") (DTM) series for the [HWA Team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HWA_Team "HWA Team") in the [2005 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Masters_season "2005 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season").[^121] He was partnered by [Gary Paffett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Paffett "Gary Paffett"), [Jean Alesi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Alesi "Jean Alesi") and [Bernd Schneider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Schneider_\(racing_driver\) "Bernd Schneider (racing driver)"). Häkkinen had previous experience of driving touring cars in July 2001 at the [Brno Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno_Circuit "Brno Circuit") alongside Schneider.[^122] In January, Häkkinen once again participated in the Arctic Rally driving a Toyota Corolla with co-driver Risto Pietiläinen. Häkkinen retired when he slid off the road on the eleventh stage.[^123]

His debut season started well: He secured eighth position in his first race at the [Hockenheimring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockenheimring "Hockenheimring"); and in the following race at the [EuroSpeedway Lausitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroSpeedway_Lausitz "EuroSpeedway Lausitz"), held his first podium in his DTM career. Two weeks later at [Spa-Francorchamps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"), Häkkinen qualified on pole position and later took his first DTM win after only three starts.[^124] Despite the early success, he did not score points in the next three races which included consecutive retirements at [Oschersleben](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport_Arena_Oschersleben "Motorsport Arena Oschersleben") and the [Norisring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norisring "Norisring"). He later scored a further points position at the race held at the [Nürburgring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring "Nürburgring"), before further consecutive 12th-place finishes in the next two races. Häkkinen ended the 2005 season by taking a second-place finish at [Istanbul Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_Park "Istanbul Park") and finished outside of the points scoring positions with 15th place at Hockenheim. Häkkinen finished the season fifth in the Drivers' Championship, with 30 points.[^13]

Häkkinen driving for HWA at Brands Hatch in 2006

On 15 November 2005, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain with HWA for the [2006 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Masters_season "2006 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season"),[^125] and was partnered by Alesi, Spengler and [Jamie Green](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Green "Jamie Green"). For the upcoming season, Häkkinen set his target of winning the championship, although he believed the competition from Audi would make the title challenge difficult.[^126] Outside of DTM, Häkkinen participated in his fourth Arctic Rally, driving a [Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution_VII "Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII") with co-driver Risto Pietiläinen.[^127] He finished 36th overall.[^128]

His season got off well: At the opening race held at Hockenheim, he finished in fourth position; and in the following race held at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz, he drove to his first podium of the season with third place. Häkkinen did not score points in the next two consecutive races, although he later held another podium position with third place at the Norisring. In the next three races, he was unable to score more points, although he had another podium position at the Bugatti Circuit. Häkkinen concluded his season with a retirement at the Hockenheimring when his car's diffuser became damaged.[^129] Häkkinen ended the year sixth in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 25 points.[^13]

In November, Häkkinen tested a [McLaren MP4-21](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4-21 "McLaren MP4-21") for one day at the [Circuit de Catalunya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Barcelona-Catalunya "Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya") where he completed 79 laps.[^130] To prepare himself, Häkkinen spent time at the [McLaren Technology Centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Technology_Centre "McLaren Technology Centre") to acquaint himself with Formula One's revised regulations.[^131] In a 2017 retrospective interview Häkkinen revealed that he had been in advanced talks with McLaren for a return in the [2007 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_season "2007 Formula One season"). He had however been frustrated by problems with McLaren's car in the test, which had reminded him of the reasons why he had taken the sabbatical in the first place, so the plans had collapsed.[^106]

Häkkinen driving Mercedes Stars and Cars in 2007

On 28 January 2007, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain in DTM for the [2007 season](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Masters_season "2007 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season") for HWA,[^132] and was partnered by Spengler, Green and Schneidler. Häkkinen stated that during 2006, his team's potential was not realised and aimed during 2007 to improve on his results.[^132] He started the season by earning consecutive finishes in the first two races, albeit outside of the points scoring positions. At the third race of the season held at EuroSpeedway Lausitz, Häkkinen won his first race of the season although only half points were awarded due to errors made by race organisers, resulting in the official race result remaining provisional.[^133] He held pole for the following race at Brands Hatch where he finished in fourth position,[^134] and followed the result with a ninth-place finish at the Norisring.[^135]

Häkkinen had his second victory of the season at Mugello, after starting from 15th position.[^136] He later managed 7th place at [Zandvoort](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zandvoort_Circuit "Zandvoort Circuit") and later finished with a 10th-place finish at the Nürburgring. At the race held at the Circuit de Catalunya, Häkkinen was involved in a collision with Audi driver [Martin Tomczyk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Tomczyk "Martin Tomczyk"). Häkkinen was penalised with a €20,000 fine, received a ten-place grid penalty for the next round and was disqualified from the race.[^137] He finished the season with a 17th-place finish at the Hockenheimring. Häkkinen finished the season 7th place in the Championship, with 22 points.[^13]

Häkkinen at the [2022 Austrian Grand Prix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Austrian_Grand_Prix "2022 Austrian Grand Prix")

Häkkinen announced his retirement from competitive motorsport in November 2007.[^138] He was quoted as saying that the decision "was not an easy one", but added that "racing is still in my blood and this decision does not mean that this will prevent me from racing for pleasure".[^139]

In November 2008, it was announced that Häkkinen would start a new career in driver management and would work alongside [Didier Coton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Didier_Coton&action=edit&redlink=1 "Didier Coton (page does not exist)") in his firm Aces Associate Group.[^140] Häkkinen contested his fifth Arctic Rally event in January 2009 driving a [Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution_IX "Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX") alongside co-driver [Ilkka Kivimaki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ilkka_Kivimaki&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ilkka Kivimaki (page does not exist)") and finished 19th overall.[^141] [^142] Häkkinen made his debut in sports cars when Team AMG China entered a [Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_SLS_AMG "Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG") in November 2011 to participate in the [Intercontinental Le Mans Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_Le_Mans_Cup "Intercontinental Le Mans Cup") at the [6 Hours of Zhuhai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_6_Hours_of_Zhuhai "2011 6 Hours of Zhuhai") race alongside [Lance David Arnold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_David_Arnold "Lance David Arnold") and [Cheng Congfu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Congfu "Cheng Congfu").[^143] During the event, the team retired after completing two hours.[^144] In October 2013, Häkkinen participated in the GT Asia series for the two races held at the [Zhuhai International Circuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai_International_Circuit "Zhuhai International Circuit"), driving a [Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_SLS_AMG "Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG") alongside co-driver [Matthew Solomon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Solomon "Matthew Solomon").[^145] Häkkinen drove to victory in the first race after starting from sixth position. The victory resulted in a 15-second handicap during his mandatory pitstop for his second race and finished in fourth position.[^146]

On 16 March 2017, McLaren announced that Häkkinen has rejoined the team as partner ambassador.[^147] In November 2021, Häkkinen helped McLaren [IndyCar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Series "IndyCar Series") driver [Pato O'Ward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pato_O%27Ward "Pato O'Ward") prepare for his test of the [McLaren MCL35M](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MCL35M "McLaren MCL35M") by familiarizing O'Ward on his championship winning [MP4/13](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/13 "McLaren MP4/13") around [Laguna Seca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeatherTech_Raceway_Laguna_Seca "WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca").[^148]

In August 2019, Häkkinen raced in the [2019 Suzuka 10 Hours](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Suzuka_10_Hours "2019 Suzuka 10 Hours"), the fourth round of the [2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Intercontinental_GT_Challenge "2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge") driving a [McLaren 720S GT3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_720S "McLaren 720S") alongside two-time [Super Formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Formula_Championship "Super Formula Championship") champion [Hiroaki Ishiura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroaki_Ishiura "Hiroaki Ishiura") and [Japanese Formula 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Formula_3_Championship "Japanese Formula 3 Championship") racer [Katsuaki Kubota](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Katsuaki_Kubota&action=edit&redlink=1 "Katsuaki Kubota (page does not exist)"), with Planex Smacam Racing.[^149]

Häkkinen and [Emma Kimiläinen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Kimil%C3%A4inen "Emma Kimiläinen") competed together for Team Finland at the [Race of Champions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_of_Champions "Race of Champions") on 5–6 February 2022.[^150] He is set to again compete in the race in 2023 alongside Formula One driver [Valtteri Bottas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas "Valtteri Bottas"), who was originally going to be his partner at the 2022 edition before backing out.[^151] [^152]

In December 2021, Häkkinen was announced as a Formula One analyst for the sports broadcaster Viaplay.[^153] From 2022 onwards, Häkkinen became part of a permanent team of analysts on-site at the Grands Prix. In the team of analysts, Häkkinen is accompanied by David Coulthard and [Jos Verstappen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Verstappen "Jos Verstappen").

Journalist [Peter Windsor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Windsor "Peter Windsor") analysed Häkkinen's driving style for an article in *[F1 Racing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_Racing "F1 Racing")* magazine, writing that Häkkinen was an "oversteering" driver, which made him faster on slippery surfaces and meant that "tail-happy" cars suited him.[^154] This allowed him to perform better at circuits that have medium-speed corners.[^155] During his karting career, Häkkinen developed the habit of using the brake pedal with his left foot. He reverted to using his right foot when he participated in DTM, but became uncomfortable with this style and switched again to left-foot braking in mid-2006.[^156] He became known as a "late season driver"; the second half of a season suited Häkkinen due to experience on these tracks and allowed time for his car to be altered towards his preference.[^54]

Häkkinen was criticized for being a poor car developer, though this may have been exaggerated due to his initial struggles with the English language early in his career.[^54] [Adrian Newey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey "Adrian Newey"), the designer of Häkkinen's championship-winning McLarens, described an instance of Häkkinen's approach to input on car development when Häkkinen kept telling him during the initial testing of the [McLaren MP4/13](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_MP4/13 "McLaren MP4/13") that the car was understeering. Newey subsequently adjusted the car to correct for understeer, but this only made it slower. After digging deeper into the test data and listening closely to what Häkkinen was describing Newey realized the car was not understeering but had rear end biased instability on corner entry that Häkkinen was compensating for with understeer. This experience proved crucial for Newey's relationship with Häkkinen during their run together at McLaren, as after that Newey no longer had issues understanding Häkkinen's inputs on car development.[^157] Newey said that Häkkinen's countryman, protege, and future McLaren driver [Kimi Räikkönen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen "Kimi Räikkönen") had a similar approach to input on car development.[^157]

During his Formula One career, Häkkinen was regarded as taciturn, taking lengthy pauses before giving terse responses to questions.[^158] Since his retirement, he has often been voted among the greatest Formula One drivers.[^158] [^159] Michael Schumacher has stated that Häkkinen was the driver whom he gained the most satisfaction of racing against.[^158]

Häkkinen has lived in [Monaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco "Monaco") since 1991. He also owns properties in France and Finland.[^9] On 18 May 2008, his newly completed mansion in France was burned down after a light in one of his trophy cabinets short circuited. No injuries were reported, although Häkkinen's collection of Formula One trophies was destroyed.[^160]

Häkkinen married Erja Honkanen, a former TV journalist, in 1998. The couple have one son and one daughter. They divorced in 2008.[^161] Häkkinen also has two daughters and a son with his Czech second wife [^162] Markéta Remešová.[^163] [^164]

Häkkinen joined [Johnnie Walker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Walker "Johnnie Walker") as Global Responsible Drinking Ambassador for [Diageo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diageo "Diageo") in September 2006, campaigning for the message of responsible drinking. He also led the organisation's Join the Pact campaign to spread consumer commitments for the prevention of drunk driving.[^165] He is also brand ambassador for [Mercedes-Benz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz "Mercedes-Benz") and [UBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS "UBS").[^166] In 2016, he became an official brand ambassador for [Nokian Tyres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokian_Tyres "Nokian Tyres").[^167]
