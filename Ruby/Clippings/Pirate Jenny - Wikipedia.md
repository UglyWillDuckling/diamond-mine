"**Pirate Jenny**" (German: "Seeräuber-Jenny") is a well-known song from *[The Threepenny Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera "The Threepenny Opera")* by [Kurt Weill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill "Kurt Weill"), with lyrics by [Bertolt Brecht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht "Bertolt Brecht"). The English lyrics are by [Marc Blitzstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Blitzstein "Marc Blitzstein"). It is one of the best known songs in the opera, after "[Mack the Knife](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_the_Knife "Mack the Knife")".

- The song was an inspiration for [Bob Dylan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan")'s "[When the Ship Comes In](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Ship_Comes_In "When the Ship Comes In")". As a tribute to Lotte Lenya, Dylan later put the artwork for one of her albums on display on the cover of his 1965 album *[Bringing It All Back Home](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_It_All_Back_Home "Bringing It All Back Home")*. In his 2004 memoir, Dylan described the enormous influence that "Pirate Jenny" had on his songwriting development.[^4]
- [Clifford Harper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Harper "Clifford Harper") drew a graphic adaptation of the song, entitled "The Black Freighter" in the magazine *[Anarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_\(magazine\) "Anarchy (magazine)")* No. 2.[^5]
- Comic-book writer [Alan Moore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore "Alan Moore") cited this song as one of the inspirations for [the Black Freighter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen#Tales_of_the_Black_Freighter "Watchmen") pirate material in *[Watchmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen "Watchmen")*.[^6] The [Nina Simone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone "Nina Simone") version also appears on the [soundtrack for the motion picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen:_Music_from_the_Motion_Picture "Watchmen: Music from the Motion Picture"), and during the credits of the [direct-to-video](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-video "Direct-to-video") animated feature *[Tales of the Black Freighter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_\(2009_film\) "Watchmen (2009 film)")*. In the [2019 TV series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_\(TV_series\) "Watchmen (TV series)"), [Jessica Camacho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Camacho "Jessica Camacho") portrays "Pirate Jenny", a member of the Tulsa police.
- In *[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen,_Volume_III:_Century#Chapter_1._What_Keeps_Mankind_Alive? "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century")*, also written by Alan Moore, Jenny's revenge fantasy is taken as a literal event in which "Janni", who is [Captain Nemo's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_characters#Captain_Nemo "List of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters") daughter, is [gang raped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape "Gang rape") and summons the crew of the *Nautilus* to slaughter her rapists and the indifferent spectators alike.
- The song was inspiration for [Lars von Trier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier "Lars von Trier")'s *[Dogville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogville "Dogville")* (2003), a film about a mistreated woman who seeks revenge on her neighbors.[^7]
- The song is paraphrased on [Chico Buarque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico_Buarque "Chico Buarque")'s "[Geni e o Zepelim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geni_e_o_Zepelim "Geni e o Zepelim")". This song is a number from his musical play *[Ópera do Malandro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93pera_do_Malandro "Ópera do Malandro")*, which is based on Brecht's *[The Threepenny Opera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera "The Threepenny Opera")*. In Chico's version, Jenny (Geni) ends up saving the city, just to be despised (again) immediately after.
- [Sasha Velour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_Velour "Sasha Velour") performed a version of the song, with lyrics altered to be about drag, in their short film *Pirate Jenny,* the first of their 2018 anthology *One Dollar Drags.*[^8]
