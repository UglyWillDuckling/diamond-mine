## Lyrics

I can’t really, uh, play the guitar very well, um, or sing  
So you know, apologies

Stunning 8K-resolution meditation app  
In honor of the revolution, it’s half-off at the Gap  
Deadpool’s self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun  
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that’s just begun

There it is again, that funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
There it is again, that funny feeling  
That funny feeling

The surgeon general’s pop-up shop, Robert Iger’s face  
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles’ take on race  
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war  
The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door  
The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show  
Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go  
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul  
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall

There it is again, that funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
There it is again, that funny feeling  
That funny feeling

Reading Pornhub’s terms of service, going for a drive  
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V  
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown  
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone  
Total disassociation, fully out your mind  
Googling “derealization”, hating what you find  
That unapparent summer air in early fall  
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

There it is again, that funny feeling  
That funny feeling  
There it is again, that funny feeling  
That funny feeling

Hey, what can you say? We were overdue  
But it’ll be over soon, you wait  
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue  
But it’ll be over soon, just wait  
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-dum  
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue  
But it’ll be over soon, you wait  
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-dum  
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue  
But it’ll be over soon, you wait  
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da  
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue  
But it’ll be over soon, you wait  
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-dum  
Hey

[Full Lyrics](https://sonichits.com/video/Bo_Burnham/That_Funny_Feeling)

In an era where satire and social commentary are as abundant as the issues they aim to dissect, Bo Burnham emerges with ‘That Funny Feeling’, offering a profound commentary on modern society’s absurdities and paradoxes. More than a monologue set to chords, the song is a reflective piece that captures a generational [[zeitgeist]] with scalpel-like precision.

Beneath the veneer of its gentle acoustic strums, ‘That Funny Feeling’ traverses through a myriad of contemporary life’s **contradictions**, delivering an [[anthemic]] [[soliloquy]] that echoes in the mind long after the last note fades. Let’s delve into the layers of meaning behind this poignant ballad and explore why it has resonated with so many listeners.

## An Ode to 21st-Century Discontent: Irony as Art
#Irony 
Burnham crafts a melody that’s a [[siren song]] for disillusioned souls, ==blending wry humor with raw truth.== The lyrics serve as a catalog of ironies that define the current age: 

Meditation apps promising peace at a premium and revolutions commercialized by retail discounts.
It’s a sharp critique of capitalism’s [[commodification]] of **absolutely everything,** **even rebellion**.

The song consistently [[juxtapose]]s profound societal movements with trivial modern phenomena, leading to ‘that funny feeling’—a mix of ==amusement==, ==discomfort==, and ==resignation==. Burnham’s efficacy lies in his ability to spotlight these [[dichotomies]] not just lyrically but in the very [[dissonance]] between his subdued performance and the **weight** of the words he delivers.

## ‘That Funny Feeling’: The Echo of [[Existential Dread]]

‘That Funny Feeling’ serves as more than a catchy hook—it’s the [[encapsulation]] of [[disquiet]], the unnamed anxiety stirred by the **hyperreality** of our times. When Burnham croons about a ‘quiet comprehending of the ending of it all,’ he’s not just crafting lyrics; he’s giving voice to the **low hum** of [[existential dread]] that permeates the digital age.

Burnham’s invocation of ‘total [[disassociation]]’ and ‘[[derealization]]’ illustrates this detachment further. The song plays out **like a scroll through a news feed**, where global tragedies sit beside pop culture fluff, and our numbness to this ==bizarre coexistence== is the ‘funny feeling’ that’s impossible to shake.

## Decoding the [[Veneer]] of Pop Culture References

In Burnham’s lyrical landscape, names and brands—[[Steve Aoki]], [[Logan Paul]], [[Robert Iger]]—act as [[shorthand]] ==for the peculiarities and absurdities== of the [[influencer]] era.
**These are not throwaway references** but a carefully curated collection intending to paint a mosaic of the **era’s zeitgeist**. 
Their mention is not about the individuals but what they represent: **the** [[commodification]] **of self**, **the theatrics of manufactured authenticity, and the blurred lines between entertainment and reality.**

By naming these cultural icons and phenomena, Burnham asks us to consider the value we ascribe to celebrity, the bizarre phenomena we’ve normalized, and the **societal undercurrents** they reflect. Each reference is another thread in the tapestry of modern [[dissonance]] embodied in the song.

## A Call to Mindfulness Amidst the Mayhem

As Burnham strings together scenes of an **off-kilter** normalcy—’Carpool Karaoke’, ‘a mass shooting at the mall’—**there’s a rallying cry for awareness among the anesthetization**. ==The song urges a mindful engagement with the world around us, even when it feels alien or overwhelming.==

The genius in Burnham’s approach is that he doesn’t prescribe a solution but presents a mirror. It’s a call to recognize the ‘funny feeling’ as a **signpost of our times**, a collective symptom that merits attention. **He doesn’t resolve the tension but fosters a space that invites contemplation**, a rare offering in the rapid consumption of media today.

## Unforgettable Lines: A Lyrical Time Capsule
[[Time Capsule]]

Certain lines in ‘That Funny Feeling’ are etched deep into the conscience of listeners. ‘==The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door==’— with these words, Burnham encapsulates the [[paradox]] **of unprecedented access amidst profound isolation**, underlining the song’s status as a cultural [[time capsule]].

Resonating as modern-day maxims, lyrics such as ‘the live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show’ become potent symbols of our era’s obsession with [[nostalgia]] **repackaged as innovation**.

This isn’t just songwriting; it’s a **linguistic cartography** of our [[collective psyche]], mapping out the terrain of contemporary culture with laser precision.
