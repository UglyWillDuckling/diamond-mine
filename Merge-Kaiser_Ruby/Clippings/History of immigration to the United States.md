Throughout [U.S. history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States "History of the United States"), the country experienced successive waves of [immigration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration "Immigration"), particularly [from Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Americans "European Americans") and later on [from Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans "Asian Americans") and [from Latin America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans "Hispanic and Latino Americans"). Colonial-era immigrants often repaid the cost of transoceanic transportation by becoming [indentured servants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude "Indentured servitude") where the employer paid the ship's captain. In the late 1800s, immigration from [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") and [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") was restricted. In the 1920s, restrictive immigration quotas were imposed but political refugees had special status. Numerical restrictions ended in 1965. In recent years, the largest numbers of immigrants to the United States have come from Asia and [Central America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America") (see [Central American crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_crisis "Central American crisis")).

Attitudes towards new immigrants have fluctuated from favorable to hostile since the 1790s. Recent debates have focused on the [southern border](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border "Mexico–United States border") (see [Illegal immigration to the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States "Illegal immigration to the United States") and [Mexico–United States border wall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border_wall "Mexico–United States border wall")) and the status of "dreamers", people who illegally migrated with their families when they were children and have lived in the U.S. for almost their entire lives (see [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals")).

In 1607, the first successful English colony settled in [Jamestown, Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia "Jamestown, Virginia"). Once [tobacco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco "Tobacco") had been found to be a profitable [cash crop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_crop "Cash crop"), many plantations were established along the [Chesapeake Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay "Chesapeake Bay") in [Virginia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia "Virginia") and [Maryland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland "Maryland"). The colonists were met with hard times including famine, illness, and their relationship with the local [Native American tribes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_tribes_in_Virginia "Native American tribes in Virginia"). There were several historic events that took place in Jamestown between the settlers and the Native American tribes. When the settler [John Rolfe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rolfe "John Rolfe") married [Pocohontas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas "Pocahontas"), there was a moment of peace between the two cultures. Prior to the union, [Algonquian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_peoples "Algonquian peoples") tribes battled the settlers. The year 1609 was known as the " [Starving Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starving_Time "Starving Time") " since over 100 settlers died from starvation and illness. John Rolfe introduced a new type of tobacco seed from the [West Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies "West Indies"), and the Jamestown society began to improve.[^1]

Thus began the first and longest era of immigration that lasted until the [American Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution") in 1775. Settlements grew from [initial English toeholds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_overseas_possessions "English overseas possessions") from the New World to [British America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_America "British America"). It brought Northern European immigrants, primarily of British, German, and Dutch extraction. The English ruled from the mid-17th century and were by far the largest group of arrivals remaining within the [British Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"). Over 90% of those early immigrants became farmers.[^2]

Large numbers of young men and women came alone as [indentured servants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servants "Indentured servants"). Their passage was paid by employers in the colonies who needed help on the farms or in shops. Indentured servants were provided food, housing, clothing and training but did not receive wages. At the end of the indenture (usually around age 21, or after a service of seven years), they were free to marry and start their own farms.[^3]

Seeking religious freedom in the New World, 100 [English Pilgrims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_\(Plymouth_Colony\) "Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)") established a small settlement near [Plymouth, Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth,_Massachusetts "Plymouth, Massachusetts"), in 1620. Tens of thousands of English [Puritans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans "Puritans") arrived, mostly from the [East Anglia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Anglia "East Anglia") ([Norfolk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk "Norfolk"), [Suffolk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk "Suffolk"), [Essex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex "Essex")),[^4] and settled in [Boston, Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston") and the [adjacent areas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston "Greater Boston") from around 1629 to 1640 to create a land dedicated to their religion. The earliest [New English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England") colonies, [Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony "Massachusetts Bay Colony"), [Connecticut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Colony "Connecticut Colony"), [Rhode Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Rhode_Island_and_Providence_Plantations "Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations"), and [New Hampshire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_New_Hampshire "Province of New Hampshire"), were established along the northeastern coast. Large-scale immigration to this region ended before 1700, but a small but steady trickle of later arrivals continued.[^5]

[Plymouth Colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Colony "Plymouth Colony") was founded by a group of European settlers known as the [pilgrims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrims_\(Plymouth_Colony\) "Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)") who had left Europe to separate from the [Church of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England "Church of England") and wanted religious freedom. They sailed from England on the [Mayflower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower "Mayflower") and arrived in 1620. Plymouth was part of the [New England Confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Confederation "New England Confederation"), made up of four Puritan colonies: Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Haven. The colonies formed an alliance to protect themselves from attacks from Native American tribes, the Dutch, and the French.[^6]

The Pilgrims were a small group of people from [Scrooby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrooby "Scrooby"), [England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England"). They originally left England to go to [Holland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland "Holland") because they faced persecution from the [Church of England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England "Church of England"), and they eventually ended in North America, where they began a new life. The Netherlands provided the Puritans with somewhat more tolerance, but they felt that it was their calling to spread the word of the Gospel to the New World, which led them to America.[^7]

The New English colonists were the most urban and educated of all their contemporaries and had had many skilled farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen among them. They started the first [university](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University"), [Harvard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College"), in 1635 to train their ministers. They mostly settled in small villages for mutual support (nearly all of them had their own militias) and common religious activities.

Shipbuilding, commerce, agriculture, and fishing were their main sources of income. New England's healthy climate (the cold winters killed the mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insects), small widespread villages (minimizing the spread of disease), and abundant food supply resulted in the lowest death rate and the highest birth rate of any of the colonies. The eastern and northern frontier around the initial New England settlements was mainly settled by the descendants of the original New Englanders. Immigration to the New England colonies after 1640 and the start of the [English Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War "English Civil War") decreased to less than 1% (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all of the years prior to 1845. The rapid growth of the New England colonies (approximately 900,000 by 1790) was almost entirely from the high birth rate (>3%) and the low death rate (<1%) per year.[^8]

The Dutch colonies, which were organized by the [United East Indian Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company "Dutch East India Company"), were first established along the [Hudson River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River") in present-day [New York State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State "New York State") starting about 1626. Wealthy [Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Americans "Dutch Americans") [patroons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patroon "Patroon") set up large landed estates along the Hudson River and brought in farmers, who became renters. Others established rich trading posts to trade with Native Americans and started cities such as [New Amsterdam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam "New Amsterdam") (now New York City) and [Albany, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York "Albany, New York").[^9] After the English seized the colony and renamed it New York, Germans (from the [Palatinate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Palatinate "Electoral Palatinate")) and Yankees (from New England) began arriving.[^10]

The Dutch initially settled in territories now referred to as New York, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and New Jersey. The Dutch controlled [New Netherland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland "New Netherland") for forty years, an area now known as New York. In 1664, the [Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people "Dutch people") settlement area was taken over by the English. In 1696, almost 30,000 people lived in the Province of New York. There were many farm products because of the woods and grasslands, which provided feed for the animals. The [Hudson River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River") was used to ship farm products and furs.[^11]

Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware formed the [Middle Colonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Colonies "Middle Colonies"). Pennsylvania was settled by [Quakers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers "Quakers") from England and Wales, followed by [Ulster Scots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people "Ulster Scots people") (Northern Ireland) on the frontier and numerous German Protestant sects, including the [German Palatines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Palatines "German Palatines"). The earlier colony of [New Sweden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Sweden "New Sweden") had small settlements on the lower [Delaware River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_River "Delaware River"), with immigrants of [Swedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Americans "Swedish Americans") and [Finns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finns "Finns"). Those colonies were absorbed by 1676.[^12]

The Middle Colonies were scattered west of New York City (established 1626; taken over by the English in 1664) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (established 1682). New Amsterdam/New York had the most diverse residents from different nations and prospered as a major trading and commercial center after about 1700. From around 1680 to 1725, Pennsylvania was controlled by the Quakers. The commercial center of Philadelphia was run mostly by prosperous Quakers and was supplemented by many small farming and trading communities, with a strong German contingent located in villages in the Delaware River Valley.[^13]

Around 1680, when Pennsylvania was founded, many more settlers started to arrive in the Middle Colonies. Many Protestant sects were attracted by freedom of religion and good cheap land. They were about 60% British and 33% German. By 1780, New York's population was around 27% descendants of Dutch settlers, about 6% African, and the remainder mostly English with a wide mixture of other Europeans. New Jersey and Delaware had a British majority, with 7–11% Germans, about 6% Africans, and a small contingent of the Swedish descendants of New Sweden.

The fourth major center of settlement was the [western frontier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier "American frontier"), in the inland parts of Pennsylvania and south colonies. It was mainly settled from about 1717 to 1775 by [Presbyterian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism "Presbyterianism") farmers from Northern England border lands, [Scotland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Scotland "History of Scotland"), and [Ulster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster "Ulster") who were fleeing hard times and religious persecution.[^14] Between 250,000 and 400,000 Scots-Irish migrated to America in the 18th century.[^14] The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from Pennsylvania to [Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(U.S._state\) "Georgia (U.S. state)"). Areas whose 20th-century censuses reported mostly " [American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States "Race and ethnicity in the United States") " ancestry were the places in which historically, northern English, Scottish and Scots-Irish Protestants settled: in the interior of the [South](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"), and the [Appalachian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains "Appalachian Mountains") region. Scots-Irish American immigrants, were made up of people from the southernmost counties of Scotland who had initially settled in Ireland. They were heavily Presbyterian, and largely self-sufficient. The Scots-Irish arrived in large numbers in the early 18th century and often preferred to settle in the back country and the frontier from Pennsylvania to Georgia, where they mingled with second-generation and later English settlers. They enjoyed the very cheap land and independence from established governments common to frontier settlements.[^15]

The mostly-agricultural [Southern Colonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Colonies "Southern Colonies") initially had very high death rates for new settlers because of [malaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria "Malaria"), [yellow fever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever "Yellow fever"), and other diseases, as well as [skirmishes with Native Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars "American Indian Wars"). However, a steady flow of new immigrants, mostly from Central England and the London area, kept the population growth. As early as 1630, initial areas of settlement had already been largely cleared of Native Americans by major outbreaks of [measles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles"), [smallpox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox"), and [bubonic plague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague "Bubonic plague") decades before European settlers began arriving in large numbers. The leading killer was smallpox, which arrived in the New World around 1510–1530.[^16]

Initially, the plantations established in these colonies were mostly owned by friends (mostly minor aristocrats and gentry) of the British-appointed governors. A group of Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlanders created a settlement at [Cape Fear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_\(region\) "Cape Fear (region)") in North Carolina, which remained culturally distinct until the mid-18th century, when it was swallowed up by the dominant English-origin culture.[^17] Many settlers from Europe arrived as indentured servants and had their passage paid for, in return for five to seven years of work, including free room and board, clothing, and training, but without cash wages. After their periods of indenture expired, many of the former servants founded small farms on the frontier.

By the early 18th century, the arrival of Africans forced to become slaves became a significant component of the immigrant population in the Southern colonies. In fact, between 1700 and 1740, a large majority of the net overseas migration to those colonies were Africans. In the third quarter of the 18th century, the population of that region amounted to roughly 55% British, 38% black, and 7% [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Americans "German Americans"). In 1790, 42% of the population in South Carolina and in Georgia was of African origin.[^18] Before 1800, the growing of tobacco, rice, and indigo in plantations in the Southern colonies had relied heavily on the labor of slaves from Africa.[^19] The [Atlantic slave trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade "Atlantic slave trade") to mainland North America stopped during the American Revolution and was outlawed in most states by 1800 and the entire nation in the 1808 [Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves "Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves"), but some slaves continued to be smuggled in illegally.[^20]

The Thirteen Colonies differed in how they were settled and by whom, but they had many similarities. Nearly all were settled and financed by privately organized British settlers or families using free enterprise without any significant royal or parliamentary government support. Nearly all commercial activity was carried out by small, privately owned businesses with good credit both in America and in England, which was essential since they were often cash poor. Most settlements were largely independent of British trade since they grew or manufactured nearly everything that they needed. The average cost of imports per household was 5–15 [pounds sterling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") per year. Most settlements consisted of complete family groups with several generations present. The population was rural, with close to 80% owning the land on which they lived and farmed. After 1700, as the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") progressed, more of the population started to move to cities, as had happened in Britain.

Initially, the [Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Americans "Dutch Americans") and [German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Americans "German Americans") settlers spoke languages brought over from Europe, but English was the main language of commerce. Governments and laws mainly copied English models. The only major British institution to be abandoned was the [aristocracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy "Aristocracy"), which was almost totally absent. The settlers generally established their own law courts and popularly elected governments. The self-ruling pattern became so ingrained that for the next 200 years, almost all new settlements had their own government up and running shortly after the settlers' arrival.

After the colonies were established, their population growth comprised almost entirely organic growth, with foreign-born immigrant populations rarely exceeding 10%. The last significant colonies to be settled primarily by immigrants were Pennsylvania (post-1680s), the Carolinas (post-1663), and Georgia (post-1732). Even there, the immigrants came mostly from England and Scotland, with the exception of Pennsylvania's large Germanic contingent. Elsewhere, internal American migration from other colonies provided nearly all of the settlers for each new colony or state.[^21] Populations grew by about 80% over a 20-year period, at a "natural" annual growth rate of 3%.

Over half of all new British immigrants in the South initially arrived as [indentured servants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude "Indentured servitude"),[^22] mostly poor young people who could not find work in England or afford passage to America. In addition, about 60,000 British convicts who were guilty of minor offences were [transported to the British colonies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_transportation "Penal transportation") in the 18th century, with the "serious" criminals generally having been executed. Ironically, those convicts are often the only immigrants with nearly complete immigration records, as other immigrants typically arrived with few or no records.[^23]

Although [Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") set up a few forts in [Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"), notably San Agustín (present-day [Saint Augustine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida "St. Augustine, Florida")) in 1565, it sent few settlers to Florida. Colonists moving north from [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico") founded the [San Juan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_New_Mexico "San Juan, New Mexico") on the Rio Grande in 1598 and [Santa Fe, New Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico "Santa Fe, New Mexico") in 1607–1608. The settlers were forced to leave temporarily for 12 years (1680–1692) by the [Pueblo Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Revolt "Pueblo Revolt") before returning.

[Spanish Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Texas "Spanish Texas") lasted from 1690 to 1821, when [Texas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas") was governed as a colony that was separate from [New Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain "New Spain"). In 1731, [Canary Islanders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands "Canary Islands") (or "Isleños") arrived to establish [San Antonio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio").[^24] Very few of the few hundred Texan and New Mexican colonizers in the Spanish colonial period were Spaniards and [criollos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criollo_people "Criollo people").[^25] California, New Mexico, and Arizona all had settlements. In 1781, Mexican settlers founded Los Angeles.

When the former Spanish colonies joined the United States, [Californios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californios "Californios") in California numbered about 10,000 and [Tejanos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejanos "Tejanos") in Texas about 4,000. New Mexico had 47,000 Mexican settlers in 1842. Arizona was only thinly settled. Only a small minority of those settlers were of European descent. As in the rest of the American colonies, new settlements were based on the [casta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casta "Casta") system. Although all could speak Spanish, it was a melting pot of mostly Native Americans with some Spanish, Portuguese, Basques, Jewish, North African Berbers, and Africans.

Former Mexican territories joined the United States in 1848 in the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo "Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo"),[^26] which ended war between Mexico and the United States. When the former Mexican territories joined the United States, [Californios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californios "Californios") in California numbered about 10,000 and [Tejanos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejanos "Tejanos") in Texas about 4,000. By 1820, Spanish-speaking immigration to the U.S. probably did not exceed 175,000 people.[^27] New Mexico had 47,000 Mexican settlers in 1842; Arizona was only thinly settled.

In the late 17th century, French expeditions established a foothold on the [Saint Lawrence River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_River "Saint Lawrence River"), [Mississippi River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River "Mississippi River") and [Gulf Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States "Gulf Coast of the United States"). Interior trading posts, forts, and cities were thinly spread. The city of Detroit was the third-largest settlement in [New France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France "New France"). [New Orleans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans") expanded when several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [Acadia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia "Acadia") made their way to Louisiana after the British expulsion, and they settled largely in the Southwest Louisiana region now called [Acadiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadiana "Acadiana").[^28] Their descendants are now called the [Cajuns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajuns "Cajuns") and still dominate the coastal areas.[^29] Additional French-speaking refugees entered the area from Saint-Domangue after the [Haitian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution "Haitian Revolution").[^28] Another cultural identity born from French immigrants is the [Creole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_peoples "Creole peoples"). About 7,000 French-speaking immigrants settled in Louisiana during the 18th century.

The following were the countries of origin for new arrivals to the United States before 1790.[^30] The regions marked with an asterisk were part of Great Britain. The ancestry of the 3.9 million population in 1790 has been estimated by various sources by sampling last names from the [1790 census](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1790_United_States_census "1790 United States census") and assigning them a country of origin. The Irish in the 1790 census were mostly Scots-Irish. The French were primarily [Huguenots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots "Huguenots"). The total U.S. Catholic population in 1790 was probably less than 5%. The Native American population inside territorial U.S. boundaries was less than 100,000.[^31]

The 1790 population reflected the loss of approximately 46,000 [Loyalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_\(American_Revolution\) "Loyalist (American Revolution)"), or "Tories", who immigrated to Canada at the end of the American Revolution, 10,000 of whom went to England and 6,000 to the Caribbean.

The 1790 census recorded 3.9 million inhabitants (not counting American Indians). Of the total white population of just under 3.2 million in 1790, approximately 86% was of British ancestry (60%, or 1.9 million, English, 4.3% Welsh, 5.4% Scots, 5.8% Irish (South), and 10.5% Scots-Irish). Among those whose ancestry was from outside of British Isles, Germans were 9%, Dutch 3.4%, French 2.1%, and Swedish 0.25%. Blacks made up 19.3% (or 762,000) of the U.S. population.[^38] The number of Scots was 200,000; Irish and Scots-Irish 625,000. The overwhelming majority of Southern Irish were Protestant, as there were only 60,000 Catholics in the United States in 1790, 1.6% of the population. Many U.S. Catholics were descendants of English Catholic settlers in the 17th century, and the rest were Irish, German and some Acadians who remained. In that era, the population roughly doubled every 23 years, mostly by natural increase. Relentless population expansion pushed the U.S. frontier to the Pacific by 1848. Most immigrants came long distances to settle in the United States. However, many [Irish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people "Irish people") left Canada for the United States in the 1840s. [French Canadians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadians "French Canadians"), who moved south from [Quebec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec") after 1860, and [Mexicans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicans "Mexicans"), who came north after 1911, found it easier to move back and forth.

Excluding enslaved Africans (see [slave trade in the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_trade_in_the_United_States "Slave trade in the United States")), there was relatively little immigration from 1770 to 1830. There was, however, significant emigration from the U.S. to Canada, including about 75,000 Loyalists as well as Germans and others looking for better farmland in what is now Ontario. Large-scale immigration in the 1830s to the 1850s came from Britain, Ireland and Germany, and most were attracted by the cheap farmland. Some were artisans and skilled factory workers who were attracted by the first stage of industrialization. The Irish Catholics were primarily unskilled workers who built a majority of the canals and railroads and settled in urban areas. Many Irish went to the emerging textile mill towns of the Northeast, but others became longshoremen in the growing Atlantic and Gulf port cities. Half of the Germans headed to farms, especially in the Midwest (with some to Texas), and the other half became craftsmen in urban areas.[^39]

Nativism took the form of political anti-Catholicism directed mostly at the Irish, as well as Germans. It became important briefly in the mid-1850s in the guise of the [Know Nothing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Nothing "Know Nothing") party. Most of the Catholics and German Lutherans became Democrats, and most of the other Protestants joined the new Republican Party. During the Civil War, ethnic communities supported the war and produced large numbers of soldiers on both sides. [Riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots "New York City draft riots") [^40] broke out in New York City and other Irish and German strongholds in 1863 when a draft was instituted,[^41] particularly in light of the provision exempting those who could afford payment.[^42]

Immigration totaled 8,385 in 1820, with immigration totals gradually increasing to 23,322 by 1830; for the 1820s, immigration more than doubled to 143,000. Between 1831 and 1840, immigration more than quadrupled to a total of 599,000. They included about 207,000 Irish, who started to emigrate in large numbers after Britain's easing of travel restrictions, and about 152,000 Germans, 76,000 British, and 46,000 French, the next-largest immigrant groups of the decade.

Between 1841 and 1850, immigration nearly tripled again and totaled 1,713,000 immigrants, including at least 781,000 Irish, 435,000 Germans, 267,000 British, and 77,000 French. The Irish, driven by the [Great Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_\(Ireland\) "Great Famine (Ireland)") (1845–1849), emigrated directly from their homeland to escape poverty and death. The failed [revolutions of 1848](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848") brought many intellectuals and activists to exile in the U.S. Bad times and poor conditions in Europe drove people out, and land, relatives, freedom, opportunity, and jobs in the U.S. lured them in.

Starting in 1820, some federal records, including ship passenger lists, were kept for immigration purposes, and a gradual increase in immigration was recorded. More complete immigration records provide data on immigration after 1830. Though conducted since 1790, the census of 1850 was the first in which place of birth was asked specifically. The foreign-born population in the U.S. likely reached its minimum around 1815, at approximately 100,000 or 1% of the population. By 1815, most of the immigrants who arrived before the American Revolution had died, and there had been almost no new immigration thereafter.

Nearly all population growth up to 1830 was by internal increase. Around 98% of the population was native-born. By 1850, that shifted to about 90% native-born. The first significant Catholic immigration started in the mid-1840s and lowered the population from about 95% Protestant to about 90% by 1850.

In 1848, the [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo "Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo"), concluding the Mexican War, extended [U.S. citizenship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._citizenship "U.S. citizenship") to approximately 60,000 Mexican residents of the [New Mexico Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory "New Mexico Territory") and 10,000 living in [Mexican California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_California_before_1900 "History of California before 1900"). An additional approximate 2,500 foreign-born California residents also became U.S. citizens.

In 1849, the [California Gold Rush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush "California Gold Rush") attracted 100,000 would-be miners from the Eastern United States, Latin America, China, Australia, and Europe. California became a state in 1850 with a population of about 90,000.

Between 1850 and 1930, about 5 million Germans migrated to the United States, which peaked between 1881 and 1885, when a million Germans settled, primarily in the [American Midwest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Midwest "American Midwest"). The Dakota Sioux had signed several treaties with the U.S. government, including the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux (1851) and the Treaty of Mendota (1851), which ceded large portions of their land to the U.S. in exchange for promises of annuities, supplies, and reservations and by 1862, the U.S. government failed to uphold its end of these agreements and the Dakota were facing terrible economic conditions. The Dakota uprising ignited the US government to use the opportunity to clear the land and make way for more European settlement. Germans were significant settlers in Minnesota, with communities established in cities like Minneapolis and St. Paul. By 1860, Minnesota had a notable German-American population, contributing to the state's development and growth.

Between 1820 and 1930, 3.5 million British and 4.5 million Irish entered America. Before 1845, most Irish immigrants had been [Protestants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestants "Protestants"). After 1845, Irish [Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholics "Catholics") began arriving in large numbers that were largely driven by the [Great Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_\(Ireland\) "Great Famine (Ireland)").[^43]

After 1880, larger steam-powered oceangoing ships replaced sailing ships, which resulted in lower fares and greater immigrant mobility. In addition, the expansion of a railroad system in Europe made it easier for people to reach oceanic ports to board ships. Meanwhile, farming improvements in [Southern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe "Southern Europe") and the [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") created surplus labor. Young people between the ages of 15 and 30 were predominant among newcomers. In this wave of migration, constituting the third episode in the history of U.S. immigration, nearly 25 million Europeans made the long trip. Italians, Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, and other Slavs made up the bulk of this migration, with 2.5 to 4 million Jews being among them.

Each group evinced a distinctive migration pattern in terms of the gender balance within the migratory pool, the permanence of their migration, their literacy rates, the balance between adults and children, and the like. However, they shared one overarching characteristic: they flocked to urban destinations and made up the bulk of the U.S. industrial labor pool, which allowed the emergence of such industries as steel, coal, automotive, textile, and garment production and enabled the United States to leap into the front ranks of the world's economic giants.

More than 23 million people immigrated to the United States from 1880 to 1930 alone. Although many of these immigrants settled in urban centers, not all of them stayed in the U.S. permanently. In some groups, like the Southern Italian *contadini*, it was common to return to their place of origin, which about half of them did. Others, like 90% of [Eastern European Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_European_Jewry "Eastern European Jewry") who immigrated to the United States, stayed permanently.[^44] Within the first decade of the 20th century, 14.7 percent of Americans were born in a different country, 22 percent of the population settling in urban areas.[^45]

Their urban destinations and numbers and perhaps an antipathy towards foreigners, led to the emergence of the second wave of organized xenophobia. By the 1890s, many Americans, particularly from the ranks of the well-off, white, and native-born, considered immigration to pose a serious danger to the nation's health and security. In 1893 a group formed the Immigration Restriction League, and it and other similarly-inclined organizations began to press Congress for severe curtailment of foreign immigration.

Irish and German Catholic immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the [nativist movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativism_in_United_States_politics "Nativism in United States politics"), originating in New York in 1843 as the [American Republican Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Republican_Party_\(1843\) "American Republican Party (1843)") (not to be confused with the modern [Republican Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "Republican Party (United States)")). Nativism was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by Catholic immigrants, who were often regarded as hostile to [American values](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_values "American values") and controlled by the [Pope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope") in [Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome"). Active mainly from 1854 to 1856, it strove to curb immigration and [naturalization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization "Naturalization"), but its efforts met with little success. There were few prominent leaders, and the largely middle-class and Protestant membership was fragmented over the issue of [slavery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery") and had most often joined the [Republican Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republican_Party_\(United_States\) "History of the Republican Party (United States)") by the time of the [1860 presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election "1860 United States presidential election").[^46] [^47]

Between 1840 and 1930, about 900,000 [French Canadians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadians "French Canadians") left [Quebec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec"), migrated to the United States, and worked mainly in [New England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England"). About half of them returned. Since the population of Quebec was only 892,061 in 1851, that was a massive exodus. 13.6 million Americans claimed to have French ancestry in the 1980 census. Many of them have ancestors who emigrated from [French Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadians "French Canadians") since immigration from France was low throughout the history of the United States. The communities that were established by these immigrants became known as [Little Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Canada_\(term\) "Little Canada (term)").

Shortly after the [American Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), some states started to pass their own immigration laws, which prompted the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court "U.S. Supreme Court") to rule in 1875 that immigration was a federal responsibility.[^50] In 1875, the nation passed its first immigration law, the [Page Act of 1875](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875 "Page Act of 1875"), also known as the Asian Exclusion Act. It outlawed the importation of Asian contract laborers, any Asian woman who would engage in prostitution, and all people considered to be convicts in their own countries.[^51]

In 1882, Congress passed the [Chinese Exclusion Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act "Chinese Exclusion Act"). By excluding all Chinese laborers from entering the country, the law severely curtailed the number of immigrants of Chinese descent allowed into the United States for 10 years.[^52] The law was renewed in 1892 and 1902. During that period, Chinese migrants [illegally entered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_entry#United_States "Illegal entry") the United States through the loosely-guarded [U.S.–Canadian border](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93United_States_border "Canada–United States border").[^53] The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed with the passage of the [Magnuson Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Repeal_Act "Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act") in 1943.

Over two million Jews fled the [pogroms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom "Pogrom") of the [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") to the safety of the U.S. from 1881 to 1924.

Prior to 1890, the individual states, rather than the federal government, regulated immigration to the United States.[^54] The Immigration Act of 1891 established a Commissioner of Immigration in the Treasury Department.[^55] The [Canadian Agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Agreement "Canadian Agreement") of 1894 extended U.S. immigration restrictions to Canadian ports.

The [Dillingham Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congressional_Joint_Immigration_Commission "United States Congressional Joint Immigration Commission") was set up by Congress in 1907 to investigate the effects of immigration on the country. The Commission's 40-volume analysis of immigration during the previous three decades led it to conclude that the major source of immigration had shifted from Central, Northern, and Western Europeans to Southern Europeans and Russians. It was, however, apt to make generalizations about regional groups that were subjective and failed to differentiate between distinct cultural attributes.[^56] [^57]

The Sunday magazine of the *New York World* appealed to Immigrants with this 1906 cover page celebrating their arrival at [Ellis Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island "Ellis Island").

The 1910s marked the high point of [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans "Italian Americans") immigration to the United States. Over two million Italians immigrated in those years, with a total of 5.3 million between 1880 and 1920.[^58] [^59] About half returned to Italy, after working an average of five years in the U.S.[^60]

About 1.5 million Swedes and Norwegians immigrated to the United States within this period because of opportunity in America and poverty and religious oppression in the united [Sweden–Norway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_between_Sweden_and_Norway "Union between Sweden and Norway"). That accounted for around 20% of the total population of the kingdom at that time. They settled mainly in the Midwest, especially Minnesota and the Dakotas. Danes had comparably low immigration rates because they had a better economy, but after 1900, many Danish immigrants were [Mormon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormons "Mormons") converts who moved to [Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah").[^61]

Over two million from [Central Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe"), mainly Catholics and Jews, immigrated between 1880 and 1924. People of [Polish ancestry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people "Polish people") are the largest Central European ancestry group in the United States, after the Germans. The immigration of [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") ethnic groups was much lower.

[Lebanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Americans "Lebanese Americans") and [Syrian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Americans "Syrian Americans") immigrants started to settle in large numbers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The vast majority of the immigrants from Lebanon and Syria were [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians"), but smaller numbers of [Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), [Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims"), and [Druze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze "Druze") also settled. Many lived in [New York City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") 's [Little Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Syria,_Manhattan "Little Syria, Manhattan") and in [Boston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"). In the 1920s and 1930s, a large number of these immigrants set out West, with [Detroit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit "Detroit") receiving a large number of Middle Eastern immigrants and many Midwestern areas had [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") work as farmers.

Congress passed a [literacy requirement in 1917](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917 "Immigration Act of 1917") to curb the influx of low-skilled immigrants from entering the country. The [Emergency Quota Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act "Emergency Quota Act") was passed in 1921, followed by the [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924 "Immigration Act of 1924"), which supplanted earlier acts to effectively ban all immigration from [Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia") and set quotas for the Eastern Hemisphere so that no more than 2% of nationalities, as represented in the 1890 census, were allowed to immigrate to America.

"New immigration" was a term from the late 1880s that refers to the influx of Catholic and Jewish immigrants from southern and eastern Europe (areas that previously sent few immigrants).[^62] The great majority came through [Ellis Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island "Ellis Island") in New York, thus making the Northeast a major target of settlement. However there were a few efforts, such as the [Galveston Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Movement "Galveston Movement"), to redirect immigrants to other ports and disperse some of the settlement to other areas of the country.

Nativists feared the new arrivals lacked the political, social, and occupational skills needed to successfully assimilate into American culture. This raised the issue of whether the U.S. was still a " [melting pot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot "Melting pot") ", or if it had just become a "dumping ground", and many old-stock Americans worried about negative effects on the economy, politics, and culture.[^63] A major proposal was to impose a literacy test, whereby applicants had to be able to read and write in their own language before they were admitted. In Southern and Eastern Europe, literacy was low because the governments did not invest in schools.[^64]

Thanks to immigration, Catholicism became the largest denomination. [St. John Cantius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John_Cantius_Church_\(Chicago\) "St. John Cantius Church (Chicago)"), one of Chicago's " [Polish Cathedrals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Cathedral_style "Polish Cathedral style") " was one of the churches these new immigrants built despite their poverty.

Restriction had proceeded piecemeal over the course of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, but immediately after the end of World War I (1914–1918) and in the early 1920s, Congress changed the nation's basic policy about immigration. The [National Origins Formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Origins_Formula "National Origins Formula") of 1921 and its final form in 1924 not only restricted the number of immigrants who might enter the United States but also assigned slots according to quotas based on national origins. The bill was so limiting that the number of immigrants coming to the U.S. between 1921 and 1922 decreased by nearly 500,000.[^65] A complicated piece of legislation, it essentially gave preference to immigrants from Central, Northern, and Western Europe; limited the numbers from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe; and gave zero quotas to Asia. However close family members could come.[^66]

The legislation excluded Latin America from the quota system. Immigrants moved quite freely from Mexico, the Caribbean (including Jamaica, Barbados, and Haiti), and other parts of Central and South America.

The era of the 1924 legislation lasted until 1965. During those 40 years, the United States began to admit, case by case, limited numbers of refugees. Jewish refugees from [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") before World War II, Jewish Holocaust survivors after the war, non-Jewish displaced persons fleeing communist rule in [Central Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") and the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), Hungarians seeking refuge after their failed uprising in 1956, and Cubans after the 1959 revolution managed to find haven in the United States when their plight moved the collective conscience of America, but the basic immigration law remained in place.

In the early 20th century, Mexico was troubled by two civil wars, increasing Mexican immigration to the United States five-fold, from twenty-thousand new arrivals every year in 1910, to between 50,000 and 100,000 new arrivals every year by the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1920.[^67] The [Mexican Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution "Mexican Revolution") that raged from 1910 to 1917, which was followed by the [Cristero War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristero_War "Cristero War") that lasted from 1926 to 1929. People moved throughout the border, with immigrants, refugees, and exiles fleeing Mexico, and rebels going back and forth from the [Mexican-American border](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border "Mexico–United States border") to contribute to the war effort.[^68] Combined, both conflicts had over a million deaths and led hundreds of thousands of Mexicans to flee to the United States in order to pursue better economic conditions and stability.[^69] The Mexican Revolution was a nation-wide conflict while the Cristero War was centralized in the Center-Pacific region of the country, so immigrants coming from the Revolution came from many states, while immigrants arriving due to the Cristero War originated in the Center-Pacific region. The states in this region include [Jalisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalisco "Jalisco"), [Guanajuato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanajuato "Guanajuato"), [Hidalgo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidalgo_\(state\) "Hidalgo (state)"), and [Michoacán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac%C3%A1n "Michoacán") and the immigrants and refugees from these regions were mostly farmers, ranchers, laborers, and would settle in states such as Texas, California, and New Mexico.[^67] In more recent times some government officials have tried to control immigration from Mexico. One of the most recent government officials that attempted to control immigration from Mexico, by trying to build a wall, was Donald Trump.

The law allowed foreign-born children of American mothers and [alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(law\) "Alien (law)") fathers who had entered the U.S. before the age of 18 and had lived in the country for five years to apply for U.S. citizenship for the first time.[^70] It also made the naturalization process quicker for the alien husbands of American wives.[^70] The law equalized expatriation, immigration, naturalization, and repatriation between women and men.[^70] [^71] However, it was not applied retroactively and was modified by later laws, such as the [Nationality Act of 1940](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_Act_of_1940 "Nationality Act of 1940").[^70] [^72]

In 1934, the [Tydings–McDuffie Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tydings%E2%80%93McDuffie_Act "Tydings–McDuffie Act") provided independence of the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines "History of the Philippines") on July 4, 1946. Until 1965, national origin quotas strictly limited immigration from the Philippines. In 1965, after revision of the immigration law, significant Filipino immigration began, totaling 1,728,000 by 2004.[^73]

In 1945, the [War Brides Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Brides_Act "War Brides Act") allowed foreign-born wives of U.S. citizens who had served in the U.S. Armed Forces to immigrate to the United States. In 1946, the War Brides Act was extended to include the fiancés of American soldiers. In 1946, the [Luce–Celler Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce%E2%80%93Celler_Act "Luce–Celler Act") extended the right to become naturalized citizens to those from the newly-independent nation of the Philippines and to Asian Indians, the immigration quota being set at 100 people per year per country.[^75]

At the end of World War II, "regular" immigration almost immediately increased under the official national origins quota system, as refugees from war-torn Europe began immigrating to the U.S. After the war, there were jobs for nearly everyone who wanted one, but most women who had been employed during the war went back into the home. From 1941 to 1950, 1,035,000 people immigrated to the U.S., including 226,000 from Germany, 139,000 from the United Kingdom, 171,000 from Canada, 60,000 from Mexico, and 57,000 from Italy.[^76]

The [Displaced Persons Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_Persons_Act "Displaced Persons Act") of 1948 finally allowed the [displaced people of World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp "Refugee camp") to start immigrating.[^77] Some 200,000 Europeans and 17,000 orphans displaced by World War II were initially allowed to immigrate to the United States outside the immigration quotas. President [Harry S. Truman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. Truman") signed the first Displaced Persons (DP) Act on June 25, 1948, which allowed entry for 200,000 DPs, and he followed with the more accommodating second DP Act on June 16, 1950, which allowed entry for another 200,000. This quota, including acceptance of 55,000 *[Volksdeutschen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksdeutsche "Volksdeutsche")*, required sponsorship for all immigrants. The American program was the most notoriously bureaucratic of all the DP programs, and much of the humanitarian effort was undertaken by charitable organizations such as the [Lutheran World Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran_World_Federation "Lutheran World Federation"), as well as other ethnic groups. Along with an additional quota of 200,000 granted in 1953 and others in succeeding years, a total of nearly 600,000 refugees were allowed into the country outside the quota system, second only to Israel's 650,000.

In 1950, after the start of the [Korean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War"), the [Internal Security Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_Internal_Security_Act "McCarran Internal Security Act") barred admission of communists, who might engage in activities "which would be prejudicial to the public interest, or would endanger the welfare or safety of the United States." Significant Korean immigration began in 1965 and totaled 848,000 by 2004.[^78]

The [Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1952 "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952") affirmed the national origins quota system of 1924 and limited total annual immigration to one sixth of one percent of the population of the continental United States in 1920, or 175,455. It exempted the spouses and children of U.S. citizens and people born in the Western Hemisphere from the quota. In 1953, the [Refugee Relief Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_Relief_Act "Refugee Relief Act") extended refugee status to non-Europeans.

In 1954, [Operation Wetback](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback "Operation Wetback") forced the return of thousands of illegal immigrants to Mexico.[^79] Between 1944 and 1954, "the decade of the wetback," the number of illegal immigrants coming from Mexico increased by 6,000 percent. It is estimated that before Operation Wetback got underway, more than a million workers had crossed the Rio Grande illegally. Cheap labor displaced native agricultural workers, and the increased violations of labor laws and discrimination encouraged criminality, disease, and illiteracy. According to a study conducted in 1950 by the President's Commission on Migratory Labor in Texas, the Rio Grande Valley cotton growers were paying approximately half of the wages that were paid elsewhere in Texas. The [United States Border Patrol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol "United States Border Patrol"), aided by municipal, county, state, federal authorities, and the military, began a quasi-military operation to search and seize all illegal immigrants. Fanning out from the lower Rio Grande Valley, Operation Wetback moved Northward. Initially, illegal immigrants were repatriated through Presidio because the Mexican city that was across the border, Ojinaga, had rail connections to the interior of Mexico by which workers could be quickly moved on to Durango. The forces used by the government were relatively small, perhaps no more than 700 men, but were augmented by border patrol officials, who hoped to scare illegal workers into fleeing back to Mexico. Ships became a preferred mode of transport because they carried illegal workers farther from the border than buses, trucks, or trains. It is difficult to estimate the number of illegal immigrants who left because of the operation, most of them voluntarily. The INS claimed as many as 1,300,000, but the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near that total. The program was ultimately abandoned because of questions surrounding the ethics of its implementation. Citizens of Mexican descent complained of police stopping all "Mexican looking" people and using extreme "police-state" methods, including the deportation of American-born children who were citizens by law.[^80]

The failed 1956 [Hungarian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 "Hungarian Revolution of 1956"), before it was crushed by the [Soviets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviets "Soviets"), forged a temporary hole in the [Iron Curtain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain "Iron Curtain") that allowed many refugees to escape, with 245,000 Hungarian families being admitted by 1960. From 1950 to 1960, the U.S. had 2,515,000 new immigrants with 477,000 arriving from Germany, 185,000 from Italy, 52,000 from the Netherlands, 203,000 from the United Kingdom, 46,000 from Japan, 300,000 from Mexico, and 377,000 from Canada.

The 1959 [Cuban Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution "Cuban Revolution"), led by [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro"), drove the upper and the middle classes to exile, and 409,000 families had immigrated to the U.S. by 1970.[^81] That was facilitated by the 1966 [Cuban Adjustment Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Adjustment_Act "Cuban Adjustment Act"), which gave permanent resident status to Cubans who were physically present in the United States for one year if they entered after January 1, 1959.

This all changed with the passage of the [Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965 "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"), a by-product of the civil rights movement and one of President Lyndon Johnson's [Great Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society "Great Society") programs. The measure had not been intended to stimulate immigration from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, or elsewhere in the developing world. Rather, by doing away with the racially-based quota system, its authors had expected that immigrants would come from "traditional" societies such as Italy, Greece, and Portugal, which were subject to very small quotas in the 1924 Act. The 1965 Act replaced the quotas with preferential categories based on family relationships and job skills by giving particular preference to potential immigrants with relatives in the country and with occupations deemed critical by the [U.S. Department of Labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor "United States Department of Labor"). After 1970, after an initial influx from European countries, immigrants from places like Korea, China, India, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Africa became more common.[^82]

In the mid-1970s, the U.S. government began accepting [Vietnamese refugees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people "Vietnamese boat people") as part of a humanitarian effort to help those who had fled the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"). This marked the beginning of a large-scale influx of Vietnamese immigrants to the U.S. Other Southeast Asians would migrate to the U.S. in the late 1980s, the first to arrive in the country would be [Vietnamese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people "Vietnamese people"), [Cambodian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_people "Khmer people"), and [Laotian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_people "Lao people") refugees.[^83]

The arrival of Vietnamese refugees in the country presented a number of challenges for both the refugees and the U.S. government. Many of them had experienced trauma and loss because of the war and needed medical, psychological, and social support.[^84] The U.S. government struggled to provide adequate resources and services to the refugees, which led to overcrowding and poor living conditions in refugee camps.

Despite the challenges, Vietnamese immigrants made significant contributions to American society. One notable contribution of Vietnamese immigrants was in the field of cuisine. [Vietnamese food](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_food "Vietnamese food") became increasingly popular in the United States, with [pho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho "Pho") restaurants and [banh mi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC "Bánh mì") sandwich shops popping up in cities across the country. Vietnamese cuisine is now considered a staple of American cuisine.

In 1986, the [Immigration Reform and Control Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act_of_1986 "Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986") (IRCA) was passed and created for the first time penalties for employers who hired illegal immigrants. IRCA, as proposed in Congress, was projected to give amnesty to about 1,000,000 workers in the country illegally. In practice, amnesty for about 3,000,000 immigrants already in the country was granted, mostly from Mexico. Legal Mexican immigrant family numbers were 2,198,000 in 1980, 4,289,000 in 1990 (includes IRCA), and 7,841,000 in 2000. Adding another 12,000,000 illegal immigrants, of which about 80% are thought to be Mexicans, would bring the Mexican family total to over 16,000,000, about 16% of the Mexican population.

Passed in September 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) was a comprehensive immigration reform focusing on restructuring the process for admitting or removing undocumented immigrants.[^85] Its passing helped to strengthen U.S. immigration laws, restructured immigration law enforcement, and sought to limit immigration by addressing undocumented migration. The reforms affected legal immigrants, those seeking entry into the U.S. and those living undocumented in the country.[^86]

IIRIRA created new barriers for refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. by narrowing the asylum criteria that had been established in the Refugee Act of 1980.[^87] To prevent fraudulent asylum filings from people who were migrating for economic or work-related reasons, IIRIRA imposed an all-inclusive filing deadline called the "One Year Bar" to asylum.[^88] IIRIRA provided limited exceptions to this rule when an "alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing the application." [^89] IIRIRA also made the asylum process more difficult for refugees by allowing for the resettlement of refugees to third countries; "precluding appeals" to denied asylum applications; implementing higher processing fees; and having enforcement officers, rather than judges, determine the expedited removal of refugees.[^85]

Law enforcement under IIRIRA was strengthened to restrict unlawful immigration. The act sought to prevent illegal immigration by expanding the number of Border Patrol agents and allowing the Attorney General to obtain resources from other federal agencies. Provisions were also made to improve infrastructure and barriers along the U.S. border area.[^90] IIRIRA also delegated law enforcement capabilities to state and local officers via 287(g) agreements.[^90] Illegal entry into the U.S. was made more difficult by co-operation between federal and local law enforcement, in addition to stiffening penalties for illegal entry and racketeering activities which included alien smuggling and document fraud.

IIRIRA addressed unlawful migration already in the U.S. by enhanced tracking systems that included detecting employment eligibility and visa stay violations as well as creating counterfeit-resistant forms of identification.[^91] The act also established the three- and ten-year re-entry bars for immigrants who accumulated unlawful presence in the U.S. and become inadmissible upon leaving the country.[^92]

The restructuring of law enforcement contributed to an increased number of arrests, detentions, and removals of immigrants.[^93] Under IIRIRA, the mandatory detention of broad groups of immigrants occurred, including those who had legal residence status but, upon removal, could have their status be removed after committing violent crimes. Relief and access to federal services were also redefined for immigrants as IIRIRA reiterated the 1996 Welfare Reform Act's tier system between citizens, legal immigrants, refugees, and illegal immigrants, which determined public benefits eligibility.[^91] In addition, IIRIRA also redefined financial self-sufficiency guidelines of sponsors who had not had to meet an income requirement to sponsor an immigrant.[^91]

The top ten birth countries of the foreign born population since 1830, according to the U.S. census, are shown below. Blank entries mean that the country did not make it into the top ten for that census, not that there are *no* data from that census. The 1830 numbers are from immigration statistics listed in the 2004 Year Book of Immigration Statistics.[^94]

The 1830 numbers list un-naturalized foreign citizens and does not include naturalized foreign born. The 1850 census is the first census that asks for place of birth. The historical census data can be found online in the Virginia Library Geostat Center.[^95] Population numbers are in thousands.
