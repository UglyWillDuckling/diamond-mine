**Hans Ruedi Giger** ( [*GHEE\-gər*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); German: [\[ˈɡiːɡɐ\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German"); 5 February 1940 – 12 May 2014) was a Swiss artist best known for his [airbrushed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbrushed "Airbrushed") images that blended human physiques with machines, an art style known as "[biomechanical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanical_art "Biomechanical art")". He was part of the [special effects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effects "Special effects") team that won an [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects") for the visual design of [Ridley Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott "Ridley Scott")'s 1979 sci-fi horror film *[Alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(film\) "Alien (film)")*, and was responsible for creating [the titular Alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph "Xenomorph") itself.[^1] His work is on permanent display at the H.R. Giger Museum in [Gruyères](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8res "Gruyères"), [Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"). His style has been adapted to many forms of media, including [album covers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_covers "Album covers"), furniture, [tattoos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo "Tattoo") and video games.

*Birth Machine* sculpture in Gruyères

Giger's first success occurred when H. H. Kunz, co-owner of Switzerland's first poster publishing company, printed and distributed Giger's first posters, beginning in 1969.[^3]

Giger's style and thematic execution were influential. He was part of the special effects team that won an [Academy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects") for Best Achievement in Visual Effects for their design work on the film *[Alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(film\) "Alien (film)")*.[^warwick-4][^5] His design for the [Alien](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_\(creature_in_Alien_franchise\) "Alien (creature in Alien franchise)") was inspired by his painting *[Necronom IV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronom_IV "Necronom IV")* and earned him the [Oscar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") in 1980. His books of paintings, particularly *[Necronomicon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon_\(H._R._Giger\) "Necronomicon (H. R. Giger)")* and *Necronomicon II* (1985) and the frequent appearance of his art in *[Omni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_\(magazine\) "Omni (magazine)")* magazine contributed to his rise to international prominence.[^arh+-2] Giger was admitted to the [Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Hall_of_Fame "Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame") in 2013.[^sfadb-6][^sffhof2013-7] He is also well known for artwork on several music recording albums including *[Danzig III: How The Gods Kill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danzig_III:_How_The_Gods_Kill "Danzig III: How The Gods Kill")* by [Danzig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danzig_\(band\) "Danzig (band)"), *[Brain Salad Surgery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Salad_Surgery "Brain Salad Surgery")* by [Emerson, Lake & Palmer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer "Emerson, Lake & Palmer"), *[Attahk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attahk "Attahk")* by [Magma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_\(band\) "Magma (band)"), *[Heartwork](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartwork "Heartwork")* by [Carcass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_\(band\) "Carcass (band)"), *[To Mega Therion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mega_Therion_\(album\) "To Mega Therion (album)")* by [Celtic Frost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Frost "Celtic Frost"), *[Eparistera Daimones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eparistera_Daimones "Eparistera Daimones")* and *[Melana Chasmata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melana_Chasmata "Melana Chasmata")* by [Triptykon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptykon "Triptykon"), [Deborah Harry's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Harry "Debbie Harry") *[KooKoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KooKoo "KooKoo"),* *[Atomic Playboys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Playboys "Atomic Playboys")* by [Steve Stevens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Stevens "Steve Stevens"), and *[Frankenchrist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenchrist "Frankenchrist")* by [the Dead Kennedys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kennedys "Dead Kennedys").

In 1998, Giger acquired the [Saint-Germain Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain_Castle "Saint-Germain Castle") in [Gruyères](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8res "Gruyères"), Switzerland, which now houses the H.R. Giger Museum, a permanent repository of his work.[^8]

Giger had a relationship with Swiss actress [Li Tobler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Tobler "Li Tobler") until she died by suicide in 1975.[^9] Tobler's image appears in many of his paintings. He married Mia Bonzanigo in 1979; they divorced a year and a half later.

Giger lived and worked in Zürich with his second wife, Carmen Maria Scheifele Giger, who is the director of the H.R. Giger Museum.[^10]

On 12 May 2014, Giger died in a Zürich hospital after suffering injuries from a fall.[^nyt-20140514-11][^swi-20140513-12][^ap-20140513-13][^ta-20140513-14]

Giger started with small ink drawings before progressing to oil paintings. For most of his career, he worked predominantly in [airbrush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbrush "Airbrush"), creating monochromatic canvasses depicting surreal, [nightmarish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare "Nightmare") dreamscapes. He also worked with pastels, markers and ink.[^arh+-2]

Giger's most distinctive stylistic innovation was that of a representation of human bodies and machines in cold, [interconnected relationships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg "Cyborg"), which he described as "biomechanical". His main influences were painters [Dado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_\(painter\) "Dado (painter)"),[^15] [Ernst Fuchs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Fuchs_\(artist\) "Ernst Fuchs (artist)"), and [Salvador Dalí](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD "Salvador Dalí"). He was introduced to Dali by painter [Robert Venosa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Venosa "Robert Venosa"). Giger was also influenced by Polish sculptor [Stanislaw Szukalski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Szukalski "Stanislaw Szukalski"), and by painters [Austin Osman Spare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Osman_Spare "Austin Osman Spare") and [Mati Klarwein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mati_Klarwein "Mati Klarwein"),[^16] and was a personal friend of [Timothy Leary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary "Timothy Leary"). He studied interior and industrial design at the School of Commercial Art in Zurich from 1962 to 1965, and made his first paintings as [art therapy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_therapy "Art therapy").[^arh+-2]

Giger directed a number of films, including *Swiss Made* (1968), *Tagtraum* (1973), *Giger's Necronomicon* (1975) and *Giger's Alien* (1979).

Giger created furniture designs, particularly the [Harkonnen Capo Chair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkonnen_Capo_Chair "Harkonnen Capo Chair") for a film of the novel *[Dune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(novel\) "Dune (novel)")* that was to be directed by [Alejandro Jodorowsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky "Alejandro Jodorowsky"). Many years later, [David Lynch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch "David Lynch") directed the film, using only rough concepts by Giger. Giger had wished to work with Lynch,[^17] as he stated in one of his books that Lynch's film *[Eraserhead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead "Eraserhead")* was closer than even Giger's own films to realizing his vision.[^arh+-2]

Giger also applied his biomechanical style to interior design. One "[Giger Bar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giger_Bar "Giger Bar")" appeared in Tokyo, but the realization of his designs was a great disappointment to him, since the Japanese organization behind the venture did not wait for his final designs, and instead used Giger's rough preliminary sketches. For that reason Giger disowned the Tokyo bar.[^cnet-18] The two Giger Bars in his native Switzerland, in Gruyères and Chur, were built under Giger's close supervision and they accurately reflect his original concepts. At [The Limelight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limelight#New_York_City_location "The Limelight") in Manhattan, Giger's artwork was licensed to decorate the VIP room, the uppermost chapel of the landmarked church, but it was never intended to be a permanent installation and bore no similarity to the bars in Switzerland. The arrangement was terminated after two years when the Limelight closed.[^19]

Giger's art has greatly influenced tattooists and [fetishists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fetish_artists "List of fetish artists") worldwide. Under a licensing deal [Ibanez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez "Ibanez") guitars released an H. R. Giger signature series: the Ibanez ICHRG2, an [Ibanez Iceman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_Iceman "Ibanez Iceman"), features "NY City VI", the Ibanez RGTHRG1 has "NY City XI" printed on it, the S Series SHRG1Z has a metal-coated engraving of "Biomechanical Matrix" on it, and a 4-string SRX bass, SRXHRG1, has "N.Y. City X" on it.[^arh+-2]

Giger is often referred to in popular culture, especially in science fiction and [cyberpunk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk "Cyberpunk"). [William Gibson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson "William Gibson") (who wrote an early script for *[Alien 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_3 "Alien 3")*) seems particularly fascinated: A minor character in *[Virtual Light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Light "Virtual Light")*, Lowell, is described as having *New York XXIV* tattooed across his back, and in *[Idoru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idoru "Idoru")* a secondary character, [Yamazaki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shinya_Yamazaki&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shinya Yamazaki (page does not exist)"), describes the buildings of [nanotech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology") Japan as Giger-esque.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
