Dovecot is an open-source email server software that provides IMAP and POP3 services for Unix-like operating systems, primarily designed for security and ease of setup. It acts as a mail storage server, allowing email clients to access and manage emails stored on the server.

The primary purpose of Dovecot is to act as a mail storage server. The mail is delivered to the server using some[[mail delivery agent ]](MDA) and is stored for later access with an email client (mail user agent, or MUA). Dovecot can also act as mail proxy server, forwarding connection to another mail server, or act as a lightweight MUA in order to retrieve and manipulate mail on remote server for e.g. mail migration.
