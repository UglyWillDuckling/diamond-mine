**West Bank Wall graffiti art** is [street art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art "Street art") on the walled sections of the [Israeli West Bank barrier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier "Israeli West Bank barrier"),[^1] [^2] by a wide range of international and Palestinian artists. The wall is 8 to 10 metres (26 to 33 ft) tall, and is easily accessible to artists as it frequently divides urban areas. The graffiti is on the Palestinian side of the wall and primarily expresses anti-wall sentiments.[^3] [^4]

The walled section of the [Israeli West Bank barrier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier "Israeli West Bank barrier"), known as the West Bank Wall, is 8 to 10 metres (26 to 33 ft) tall, providing artists a large, blank canvas.[^5] The graffiti is on the Palestinian side of the wall and primarily expresses anti-wall sentiments.[^3]

The graffiti, written in both English and Arabic, includes "flags and fists, slogans and insults, statements of pain and loss", serving as a "visual testimony" to the suffering of Palestinians under the [Israeli occupation of the West Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank "Israeli occupation of the West Bank").[^6] The diversity and amount of street art has been described as "initially overwhelming" with "layers upon layers of street art on the Wall" after almost two decades.[^5] Most of the graffiti consists of amateur tags without decorations.[^5]

In 2017, prevalent text on the wall included "Palestine", "Free Palestine", "Peace", "Love", "Justice", "Hope", "Freedom", "Unity", "Solidarity", "Friendship", "Apartheid Wall", "God is Love", "God Bless Palestine", "Jesus Loves You", [John 3:16](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_3:16 "John 3:16"), "Christmas", and criticism of US presidents and the names of visitors and their countries.[^5]

The graffiti has become a tourist attraction, particularly around the [Bethlehem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem") area,[^7] epitomised by *[The Walled Off Hotel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walled_Off_Hotel "The Walled Off Hotel")* by graffiti artist [Banksy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy "Banksy"). During Banksy's 2005 trip to the West Bank, a [Palestinian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians "Palestinians") man acknowledged both the beauty and irony of Banksy's work, telling him: "We don't want this wall to be beautiful. We hate it. Go home." [^6]

## Artists

Similar to [Berlin Wall graffiti art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall_graffiti_art "Berlin Wall graffiti art"), much of the artwork is unclaimed by artists and remains anonymous. In 2005, Banksy became the first major international artist to add graffiti to the wall;[^3] his stencilled *[Flying Balloon Girl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Balloon_Girl "Flying Balloon Girl")* was considered to serve as a form of "transnational and experiential empathy".[^6]

Banksy was followed by many others, including [Blu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu_\(artist\) "Blu (artist)"), Ericailcane, [FAILE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAILE_\(artist_collaboration\) "FAILE (artist collaboration)"), [JR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JR_\(artist\) "JR (artist)"), Know Hope, [Paul Insect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Insect "Paul Insect"), [Ron English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_English "Ron English"), Sam3, [Swoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoon_\(artist\) "Swoon (artist)") and [Lushsux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushsux "Lushsux").[^3]
