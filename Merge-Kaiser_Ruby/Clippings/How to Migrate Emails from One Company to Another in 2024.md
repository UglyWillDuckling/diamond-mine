## Steps to Migrate Email Services

Let’s delve into the steps to transfer email accounts to a new provider. We’ll also share email service migration tips to help you get started.

### 1\. Choose the Right Email Service

Before you transfer emails to another email provider, [choosing the right service](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/small-business-email-hosting) is crucial and depends on multiple factors. It’s not just about messaging but the entire ecosystem that supports and enhances your business communication.

Here are the essential criteria to consider when selecting a new provider:

- **Reliability** – the platform should guarantee uptime, ensuring you never miss a time-sensitive email.
- **Security** – with rising cyber threats, your new provider should have robust security measures, including end-to-end encryption and spam protection. This is also crucial for email data security during migration.
- **Ease of use** – the mail account interface should be user-friendly, facilitating smooth navigation even for non-tech-savvy users.
- **Scalability** – as your business expands, the email service should effortlessly adapt to your increasing storage space needs and offer additional features.
- **Support** – the platform should offer prompt and efficient customer service.
- **Cost** – when switching to a new email address, find a business email provider that ensures maximum value for money.

Considering these factors, **Hostinger** is a great choice for email hosting. We offer advanced anti-spam and anti-virus measures, robust data encryption, assured server uptime, and an intuitive user interface.

Coupled with **24/7** support, our email service is both dependable and user-friendly, making it an ideal choice for businesses.

### 2\. Prepare for Email Migration

Proper preparation is the key to successful email migration. Ensuring that you have a backup and detailed documentation of your email settings before beginning the transition minimizes potential issues.

Here are some steps to prepare when transferring to a new provider:

**Back Up Your Current Emails**

Before migrating, it’s crucial to secure a [backup of your emails](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-backup-your-emails). This ensures that no critical information is lost during the transition.

Different email providers have varying account backup processes.

For Apple Mail, open the Apple email app and select a Mailbox to back up from the top or left menu. Next, click **Mailbox** → **Export Mailbox** and select a destination to save the backup.

Gmail offers a dedicated backup tool called Google Takeout to back up all elements of your Google account.

For a Gmail account backup, open the application and select the **Mail** service. Then, click **Next** to choose a file type and delivery method. Finally, click **Create export** and wait for Google to prepare your Gmail account backup.

Microsoft Outlook offers an easy built-in backup process. Simply open Outlook settings and go to **File** → **Open & Export → Import/Export**, select **Export to a file**, and follow the prompts.

**Document Email Settings**

If you’ve configured specific settings in your email, it’s crucial to document these to recreate them in your new email service.

For Apple Mail, go to **Preferences** → **Accounts** and document the details under **Account Information** and **Server Settings**.

For Gmail, click on the gear icon in the top-right corner and go to **See all settings**. Document the details under **General**, **Labels**, **Filters**, and **Blocked Addresses**.

For Microsoft Outlook, go to **File → Account Information** → **Account Settings** → **Server Settings** and document the configuration details listed.

**Notify Contacts**

Before starting the migration, send out a notification to your essential email contacts. Let them know about the email transition period to ensure uninterrupted communication.

By laying this groundwork, you are prepared for a smooth migration process, reducing the chances of errors or data loss.

### 3\. Create Email Accounts

In this section, we’ll go through email services available at Hostinger – **Hostinger Email** (free with hosting) and **Titan Email** (purchased separately from hosting plans). Both services come with their own parameters and management interfaces.

For consistency, we suggest creating the same number of accounts as you had with your previous email provider.

**Important!** Before setting up your domain-based email addresses, ensure your [domain is pointed](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-point-domain-to-hostinger) to the new provider’s DNS.

Here’s how you can create a new email address for the two types of email services:

**Hostinger Email**

1. Open the **Emails** section on hPanel and click **Manage** next to the relevant domain or subdomain to access the Email Accounts page.

![The Emails section in the Hostinger Dashboard](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-email-manage.webp)

**Important!** For Hostinger Email, your domain will have a blue envelope symbol next to it.

2. On the Email Accounts page, click on **Create email account** to open the email setup window.

![email hPanel for the associated domain](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-email-create.webp)

3. Enter the email address, create a secure password, and click **Create**.

![Hostinger email setup guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-email-account-setup.webp)

**Titan Email**

Before we begin, let’s look at the two plans available with Titan.

**Business Email** is designed to look professional and build trust for your brand. For **$1.59/month/inbox**, it includes 10 GB of email storage, a built-in calendar and contacts feature, web and native mobile apps, and auto-replies.

The **Enterprise Email** plan, priced at **$3.99/month/inbox**, offers a substantial 50 GB of email storage and all the features of the Business Email plan – but with enhanced capabilities. It includes unlimited contact groups, read receipts, and email templates.

1. Open the **Emails** section in your Hostinger dashboard and click **Manage** next to the domain or subdomain.

![The Emails section in Hostinger Dashboard showcasing a domain with Titan email service
](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-email-manage.webp)

**Important!** For Titan Email, your domain will have a Titan logo next to it.

2. In the new window, select **Email Accounts**.

![Titan email dashboard](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-email-create.webp)

3. Next, click on **Create new email account**.

![Titan email account setup window](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-email-account-setup.webp)

4. Enter the email address, create a secure password, provide a recovery email, then hit **Create new account**. You also have the option to make the account an admin.

![Titan email setup wizard](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-email-setup-wizard.webp)

Once done, simply log in to use your professional email account.

### 4\. Recreate Previous Email Configurations

When you switch email accounts, a crucial step that is often overlooked is replicating your previous email configurations.

This ensures you can maintain your previous setup, facilitating a seamless migration and ensuring your emails operate as usual.

Here are some common solutions to keep in mind:

- **Forwarders** – if you previously used email forwarding, it’s a good idea to set that up again using your new provider. This tool helps you [forward your emails](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/email/how-to-forward-your-emails) to a different address, which is handy if you have several email addresses but prefer managing incoming mail in one inbox.
- **Catch-alls** – a catch-all email address is set up to receive all emails sent to invalid addresses on your domain. So, even if someone enters an email incorrectly, the message will land in the catch-all inbox.
- **Autoresponders** – recreate automated out-of-office replies or other autoresponder messages for your new Hostinger email account.
- **Email filters and rules** – set up specific filters or rules from your old account to organize your incoming mail, like directing particular emails to certain folders or auto-marking them as read.

### 5\. Make Sure Your Email DNS Records Are Correct

You must ensure the correct DNS records are set for your email services to function correctly. DNS records link your custom domain with the email hosting, ensuring that all emails sent to and from your domain go through the proper email servers.

**How to Add Hostinger’s Email DNS Records**

1. Navigate to the DNS management section on your Hostinger account by clicking **Connect Domain**.

![Hostinger hPanel Connect Domain section](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-DNS.webp)

2. Enter the required [DNS records for Hostinger email services](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/8650765-set-up-a-domain-for-hostinger-email). You can find the values under the **Expected records** section of each tab. Once done, make sure to save the changes.

Usually, you’ll need to include these records:

- **MX Records – Receive Emails**

MX Records, or Mail Exchange Records, is a type of DNS record that determines which server is responsible for receiving email messages on behalf of a domain.

In simple terms, when someone sends you an email, the MX record points that email to the correct server for delivery.

Each MX record has a priority, determining the order of server usage and a Time to Live (TTL), specifying how long the record is cached.

- **SPF – Protect your Reputation**

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) must be entered as a TXT record type. This specifies which mail servers can send emails on behalf of a specific domain. The TXT record stands for “Text Record” and is used to store any text-based information within the DNS.

- **DKIM – Improve Email Deliverability**

To ensure your emails get to the right recipients and aren’t marked as spam, you must add DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) using a **CNAME record**.

**Important!** Changes to DNS records can take anywhere from a few minutes to **48 hours** to propagate worldwide. During this time, your email services may not function as expected.

### 6\. Migrate Email Messages

Now, it’s time to transfer the content of your inboxes. Let’s go through the steps to execute this migration process for importing emails.

#### IMAP Email Migration

This method uses the IMAP protocol to sync messages between your old email service and your new account. Here’s how to do it:

**Hostinger Email**

1. Access the Email Accounts page in your Hostinger account.
2. Click on **Email Import** in the sidebar menu.

![Hostinger control panel with the Email Import option highlighted](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-email-import.webp)

3. In the next window, click on **New email import request**.
4. Prepare for the import by reviewing the provided support articles.

![Email import preparation support in Hostinger Dashboard

5. In the **Import from** window, enter the account and IMAP details of your old email service.

![Email import setup asking for old email account credentials and IMAP details](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-email-import-IMAP.webp)

6. Specify the import location and start the migration process.

**Titan Email**

1. Head to the **Emails** section on hPanel and click **Manage** next to the domain.
2. In the next window, click on **Import Email Data**.

![Import Email Data option in Titan email control panel](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-email-import.webp)

3. Now, select **Import a mailbox** and follow the provided steps to transfer emails to your new Hostinger mail server.

![Titan email import window](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-email-import-steps.webp)

#### Manual Email Data Backup and Restore

If you’d rather handle email imports yourself, follow these steps. In this example, we’ll be using Hostinger Email, but the steps should be similar to any other provider.

1. Access your old email provider and export email messages in an **MBOX** or **MIME** format.
2. Go to the **Emails** section on hPanel and click on **Manage** next to the domain name to open the Email Accounts page.
3. Navigate to the **Manage Email Accounts** section and click on **Webmail** next to the listed account.

![Manage Email Account tab in Hostinger Members Area](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-webmail.webp)

4. This action will open your inbox. Here, click on **More** → **Import**.

![Hostinger webmail dashborad](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-webmail-import.webp)

5. Select the **MBOX** or **MIME** file you exported from your old email account and click on **Import**.

![Email backup import wizard in Hostinger webmail](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-webmail-import-file.webp)

#### Third-Party Email Migration Tools

There are several third-party tools like Mailvare Free PST Viewer or Aid4Mail that can assist in exporting email messages and migrating emails. Choose an email migration service supporting your previous provider and the new one, then follow the tool-specific instructions.

### 7\. Import Contacts

A crucial aspect of migrating your email services is ensuring you don’t lose crucial contacts that you’ve collected over the years.

Before migrating, always create a backup of your contacts from your old email address. Most email providers offer an option to export your contacts, typically in a **CSV** or **vCard** format.

Here’s a guide on how to safely back up and import contacts:

**Hostinger Email**

1. Open Hostinger webmail and go to **Contacts** → **Import**.

![Hostinger webmail dashboard](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-webmail-contacts.webp)

2. Select the CSV file in the relevant field and click **Import**.

![Hostinger webmail contact import tool](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Hostinger-import-contacts.webp)

**Titan Email**

1. Open Titan webmail and go to **Settings** → **Preferences → Import Contacts**.

![Titan webmail dashboard](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-webmail-preferences.webp)

3. In the **Import Contacts** window, you have the option to either import contacts from Gmail or from a **CSV** file.

![Titan webmail contact import feature](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Migrate-email-Titan-webmail-contacts.webp)

### 8\. Set Up Devices and Email Clients

Next, we’ll work on configuring your devices and email clients to work seamlessly with your new email services.

Email clients fetch email data from your hosting provider using specific parameters. When you switch to a new email provider, these parameters change. You need to update these settings to continue receiving and sending emails.

**Steps to Reconfigure Your Email Clients**

1. Open the email client on your desktop, phone, or web application.
2. Access the settings or account management section, usually found under **Preferences** or **Settings**.
3. Replace the existing email server settings with your new host’s IMAP, POP3, and SMTP details. Here are the details for Hostinger Email:

| **IMAP** (Incoming) | **POP3** (Incoming) | **SMTP** (Outgoing) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host: **imap.hostinger.com** | Host: **pop.hostinger.com** | Host: **smtp.hostinger.com** |
| Encryption: ****SSL/TLS**** | Encryption: ****SSL/TLS**** | Encryption: **SSL** |
| Port number: **993** | Port number: **995** | Port number: **465** |

On the other hand, here are the details for Titan Email:

| **IMAP** (Incoming) | **POP3** (Incoming) | **SMTP** (Outgoing) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host: **imap.titan.email** | Host: **pop.titan.email** | Host: **smtp.titan.email** |
| Encryption: **SSL/TLS** | Encryption: **SSL/TLS** | Encryption: **SSL** |
| Port number: **993** | Port number: **995** | Port number: **465** |

4. Ensure that your email client uses your full email address and password for authentication for both incoming and outgoing servers.
5. Once you’ve updated these settings, save the changes and restart your email client.
6. Test its functionality by sending and receiving an email.

Note that these steps may vary based on your email client. Refer to the email platform’s official documentation or help section if you face any issues.

### 9\. Conduct Post-Migration Checks

Running post-migration checks is a critical step to ensure the entire process was executed correctly and that all your email functionalities are working.

Here are some post-migration actions we recommend:

- **Test email functionality** – send test emails to and from your migrated account. Check for timely delivery and ensure that the attachments, formatting, and links are intact.
- **Update email signatures** – your email signature should include contact information, links, and branding. Update it with any new details, especially if you’re changing email addresses.
- **Update email contacts** – updating email contacts lets you revise any outdated information or add new details that might have been missed previously.
- **Notify your contacts** – inform your contacts about the change, especially if there may be disruptions or you no longer use the same email address. This helps avoid miscommunication or confusion.
- **Review folders and labels** – if you used folder structures or labels before, ensure they’ve been replicated accurately in your new environment.
- **Check filters and rules** – verify if your automated rules or filters, such as directing specific emails to folders, still function as intended.
